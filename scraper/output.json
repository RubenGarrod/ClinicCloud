The gut microbiome has been associated with various neurological disorders, and certain drugs greatly disturb the microbiome. Our aim was to study the association of prenatal and childhood exposure (before the age of two) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and the risk of childhood epilepsy. Using population-based registers, we included all live singleton births in Sweden from 2006 to 2017. Exposure was considered prescription(s) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or H2-receptor antagonists (separately). Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. 708,903 mother-child dyads were included, and 0.5% of children had an epilepsy diagnosis. Average follow-up was 3.8\u2009years (IQR 1-6). Prenatal exposure to antibiotics (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18) and PPIs (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.65) were associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. Exposure to antibiotics (1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21), PPIs (3.40, 95% CI 2.47-4.68) and H2RAs (1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.64) before the age of two was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy after the age of two. Dose response analysis showed that one prescription of antibiotics in pregnancy or early life was not associated with an increased risk of epilepsy, while one prescription of PPIs in pregnancy or early life had an association. To conclude, our results support the hypothesis that microbiome modulating drugs are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. This needs to be further validated in other studies, ideally including indications for drug use.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

This study aimed to analyze the impact of consolidation therapy among young patients with intracranial primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 55 young patients (age < 60 years) with intracranial primary DLBCL who achieved complete remission (CR) after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based chemotherapy from March 2001 to October 2021. Among these patients, 33 patients received consolidation therapy, and 22 patients did not. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between the two groups via Kaplan-Meier analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards method, and propensity score matching (PSM). The median follow-up time was 60.1 months. A total of 13 patients (23.6%) died, and 20 patients (36.4%) experienced recurrence. Patients who received consolidation therapy had higher 2-year OS (96.8% vs. 71.1%,   = 0.036) and DFS (90.9% vs. 56.4%,   = 0.006) rates than those without consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis after PSM revealed that consolidation therapy was an independent predictor of DFS (HR = 0.282, 95% CI = 0.084-0.942,   = 0.040). Furthermore, rituximab was an independent predictor of favorable OS, and performance status was an independent predictor of OS and DFS. Subgroup analysis showed rituximab significantly improved OS in patients without consolidation therapy (88.9% vs. 45.0%,   = 0.006), but not in those with consolidation therapy (95.0% vs. 100%,   = 0.528). Consolidation therapy improved DFS in young intracranial primary DLBCL patients achieving CR after HD-MTX-based chemotherapy. Autologous stem cell transplantation and radiotherapy showed comparable consolidation benefits. Good performance status correlated with favorable outcomes. Adding rituximab to induction chemotherapy may improve OS in patients without consolidation therapy, but it might be unnecessary for those eligible for consolidation. Further research involving a larger patient cohort is warranted to ascertain rituximab's efficacy.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

The HLCS gene has been identified as the source of pathogenic mutations associated with this condition. Cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency is another rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defects in cobalamin metabolism, attributable to mutations in the MMACHC gene. This disorder often leads to methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria and is classified into early-onset and late-onset types. The late-onset type is characterized by acute or chronic progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To date, there have been no documented cases worldwide of individuals diagnosed with both HCSD and cobalamin C deficiency. This report details the case of an 11-year-and-9-month-old female patient from China who presented with symptoms including vomiting, altered consciousness, and a rash. Laboratory evaluations indicated the presence of metabolic acidosis, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in the MMACHC gene: c.482G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.R161Q) and c.567dup (p.I190Yfs\u221713).

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with MS.   Using valid keywords and searching through databases like Medlib, ScienceDirect, PubMed, etc., 10 articles published between 1999 and 2020 were collected. The inclusion criteria were developed based on clinical guidelines, focusing on studies involving adults with MS treated with IFN-\u03b2, with outcomes measuring QOL. The exclusion criteria included studies not in English, those involving pediatric populations, or those lacking a control group. In the reviewed studies, 14 scales of QOL were measured at the beginning and the end of treatment with IFN-\u03b2. The data were analyzed using the random effects model meta-analysis method with R software and Stata software. Publication bias was not significant. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q test and the I  index. In heterogeneous studies, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used for meta-analysis. The random-effect model was used for analyses with I  of more than 50%.   A total number of 1320 people with an average age of 32.40 \u00b1 8.77 years were included in this study. On average, there was a slight decline in energy and satisfaction with sexual function scales (SSF), while a slight improvement was seen in the other 12 scales, following the treatment with IFN-\u03b2. However, no significant changes were observed in any of the QOL scales following treatment, except for health distress (HD) (P < 0.001), role limitation due to physical problems (RLPP) (P < 0.001), and role limitation due to emotional problems (RLEP) (P = 0.037), all of which showed a slight but natable improvement.

The classical experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (C-EAMG) mouse model has long been used by immunizing mice with acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo fish (T-AChR), combined with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). This mixture is administered via subcutaneous injections into the hind footpads and back, but CFA often causes strong inflammatory reactions, including lesions at the injection sites. Our objective was to develop a new EAMG model (N-EAMG) that is more compliant with animal welfare. C57Bl/6 mice were immunized twice weekly by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of T-AChR with a poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) adjuvant mix. Control mice were injected with either physiological saline or the adjuvant mix alone. Various doses and injection schedules were tested, and the new model was compared with C-EAMG. Clinical symptoms were scored, antibody subtypes against T-AChR and mouse AChR were measured, and NMJ morphology and functionality were evaluated. We demonstrate that the N-EAMG model is at least as effective as the C-EAMG model. Moreover, similar to the C-EAMG model, the N-EAMG model is characterized by the production of T-AChR and m-AChR antibodies. This model also exhibited alterations in transmission at the NMJ due to antibody attack, resulting in a decrease in AChR surface area and increased AChR fragmentation. Symptoms were similar in both models but appeared more rapidly in the N-EAMG model. In addition, investigating the sensitization mechanism, we showed that i.p. injections of T-AChR with the poly(I:C)/LPS adjuvant mix, led to the recruitment in monocytes and changes in the two peritoneal macrophage subpopulations that were able to phagocytose T-AChR. These observations suggest that macrophage subtypes, albeit with varying efficiency, present the T-AChR to immune cells, leading to a specific immune response and the development of anti-AChR antibodies. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that this novel EAMG model is as effective as the C-EAMG model and offers several advantages. In particular, this model is more suitable for animal welfare and can replace the classical model in preclinical and fundamental research.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

In vitro experiments were employed using human primary VICs with TSP-1 knockdown, cultured in osteogenic induction medium, and followed by analyses including western blot, alkaline phosphatase staining, alizarin red staining, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. In vivo experiments used two murine models of CAVD to determine the role of TSP-1 silencing on aortic valve calcification.

Healthy participants (n = 94, mean age 71.1\u00a0years SD 5.10, 56% female) were recruited to investigate the relationship between nutrient intake (protein, fibre, carbohydrate, fat), physical function (chair rise time, handgrip strength) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP); a marker of gut permeability. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, fat mass/fat free mass ratio, weight and gender, reported LBP changed by; -161.9\u00a0ng/mL (95% CI -323.0, -0.8) for every 1\u00a0g increase in daily fibre/1,000 kilocalories; 80.5\u00a0ng/mL (6.7, 154.2) for 1% increase in daily energy intake as fat; and -88.1\u00a0ng/mL (-146.7, -29.6) for 1% increase in daily energy as carbohydrates. When further adjusted for C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, LBP decreased by an additional 6.9\u00a0ng/mL for fibre, increased by an additional 4.0\u00a0ng/mL for fat and decreased by an additional 3.7\u00a0ng/mL for carbohydrate. These findings suggest that in healthy older adults' nutrient intake is associated with LBP, and CRP appears to slightly modify these associations. There were no associations between LBP and handgrip strength or chair rise time. Results suggest that fibre, fat, and carbohydrates are important for maintaining gut function, potentially mediated by inflammation in older adults, although further research is needed to explore the implications for physical function and CRP as a mediator.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

The two major paediatric cooperative groups provide different therapeutic protocols based on different staging and classification, initially developed to serve patients in North America and Europe, but also used in many other parts/regions of the world. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) has developed a structure whereby such complex information may be harmonised, and able to be applied to patients globally. An international expert panel consisting of paediatric pathologists and oncologists produced a set of items critical to cancer reporting and subjected these to review and discussion using the structured processes provided by the ICCR. A formal ICCR structure was assembled, and consensus surrounding elements and their application to different therapeutic protocols was developed. The data set underwent open international consultation. This resulted in the first international data set for Wilms tumour (WT) and other paediatric renal tumours, provided herein. The use of ICCR methods enables a full understanding of highly complex and often overlapping reporting elements by international experts, and the potential of developing a set of commonly applied data elements that are fully defined. This sets the groundwork for future consolidation of definitions and harmonisation of therapies for WT and other paediatric renal tumour patients.

OMVs were isolated and their characteristics were examined through transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. PD-L1 expression was quantified via Western blot, while CD8+ T cell proliferation was measured using flow cytometry. Cytokine production (interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)) was evaluated using ELISA.

In CRC cells, treatment with AKK-derived OMVs (AKK-OMVs) significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and markedly increased CD8+ T cell proliferation and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Additionally, AKK-OMVs-treated mice showed increased expression of immune activation markers within the tumor tissue, further indicating enhanced antitumor immunity. This study reveals that AKK-OMVs, particularly those containing Amuc_1434, can modulate PD-L1 expression and potentiate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in CRC.

This involved bacterial isolation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and analysis of potential factors that may have led to resistance, such as antibiotic prescribing and patient comorbidities. Descriptive statistics were therefore applied in SPSS for data analysis. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (70%) and exhibited significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 30% and to fluoroquinolones at 22%. Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains comprised 8% of   isolates.

Increased biocide usage in households, agriculture, livestock farming, industrial settings, and hospitals produces persistent chemical residues that pollute soil and aquatic environments. Such contaminants contribute to the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), facilitating their dissemination among humans, animals, and ecosystems. In this review, we conduct a critical assessment of four significant issues pertaining to this topic. Specifically, (i) the role of biocides in exerting selective pressure within the environmental resistome, thereby promoting the proliferation of resistant microbial populations and contributing to the global spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs); (ii) the role of biocides in triggering transient phenotypic adaptations in bacteria, including efflux pump overexpression, membrane alterations, and reduced porin expression, which often result in cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics; (iii) the capacity of biocides to disrupt bacteria and make the genetic content accessible, releasing DNA into the environment that remains intact under certain conditions, facilitating horizontal gene transfer and the spread of resistance determinants; (iv) the capacity of biocides to disrupt bacterial cells, releasing intact DNA into the environment and enhancing horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants; and (iv) the selective interactions between biocides and bacterial biofilms in the environment, strengthening biofilm cohesion, inducing resistance mechanisms, and creating reservoirs for resistant microorganisms and ARG dissemination.

Recent research has revealed that in impaired skin tissues, FGF21 and its receptors are upregulated and play a significant role in accelerating the wound healing process. However, the clinical application of FGF21 is severely limited by its short   half-life: this factor is often degraded by enzymes before it can exert its therapeutic effects. To address this limitation, the transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) has emerged as an innovative approach that enables sustained drug release, significantly prolonging the therapeutic duration. Leveraging genetic recombination technology, research teams have ingeniously fused FGF21 with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to construct recombinant FGF21 complexes. These novel conjugates can efficiently penetrate the epidermal barrier and achieve sustained and stable pharmacological activity through TDDS. This review systematically analyzes the potential signaling pathways by which FGF21 accelerates skin wound repair, summarizes the latest advancements in TDDS technology, explores the therapeutic potential of FGF21, and evaluates the efficacy of CPP fusion tags. The manuscript not only proposes an innovative paradigm for the application of FGF21 in skin injury treatment but also provides new insights into its use in transdermal delivery, marking a significant step toward overcoming existing clinical therapeutic challenges.

We sought to understand the utilization and procedural safety of cardiac catheterization in pediatric patients on ECMO. We also aimed to understand differences in the types of interventions and outcomes in patients with single ventricle (SV) physiology compared to those with biventricular physiology. Characteristics and outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization while on ECMO were collected from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry: IMPACT (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment) Registry from 2011-2022. There were 3473 cardiac catheterizations performed on 2980 pediatric patients during the study period. Patients with SV comprised 31.6% of the population. Survival to hospital discharge was 53.2% overall, 45.2% in patients with SV, and 56.8% in patients with 2 ventricles. Interventional procedures occurred in 52.5% of cases. Major adverse events occurred in 11.5%, with arrhythmia, bleeding events, and unplanned cardiac/other surgeries being the commonest. Regression analysis found SV was significantly associated with major adverse events, as were interventional procedures, female sex, non-Hispanic race, diabetes mellitus, procedure status classified as salvage vs elective, and systemic heparinization. This is the first large, multicenter review of safety and outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization while on ECMO. The study identifies common adverse events during the procedure as well as risk factors associated with the same. The presented data can serve for benchmarking, quality assessment as well as potential future research.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who presented to an urban academic medical center ED for any indication and had elevated blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mm Hg and \u2264180/110 mm Hg). Eligible participants who were discharged from the ED were enrolled between February 12, 2019, and March 31, 2023, and were randomized to receive either usual care or the intervention with follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. Usual care involved standard hypertension discharge instructions with a referral for outpatient follow-up.

This cohort study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, collected CVH data for participants from 4 US centers from 1985 to 2020. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations of (1) cumulative LE8 score by quartile, (2) cumulative LE8 score and score at age 45 years, and (3) cumulative LE8 score and LE8 score slope from age 18 to 45 years with incident CVD and mortality after age 45 years.

All patients underwent definitive treatment consisting of irrigation and debridement, followed by immediate intramedullary nailing during the same anesthetic. Patients with type IIIB fractures who did not receive soft tissue coverage within 7 days of presentation, as well as those with type IIIC fractures were excluded. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of deep infection necessitating a return to the operating room. Time to surgery was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Time intervals to surgical debridement were categorized as follows: less than 6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, 18 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether key factors, including age, diabetes, fracture type, smoking, ASA classification, and time to debridement at the previously categorized time points were predictive of infection.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and stroke. Rats in the stroke groups underwent photothrombosis-induced IS in the sensorimotor cortex area. They were divided into the following subgroups: treated with anti-CD20 after ischemia and killed after 5 and/or 10 days of IS. Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA levels of inflammation markers (VIM, ANXA3, SLC22 A4, and ADM), and also levels of transcription factors for Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets (Tbet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3, respectively), and also Foxp3 were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of ADM and SLC22 A4 increased following IS on the 5th and 10th days, while treatment with anti-CD20 reversed their levels. Anti-CD20 therapy attenuated inflammation through down-regulation of VIM and ANXA3 after 10 days. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the downregulation of Th1-Th17-driven inflammatory responses (Tbet and ROR\u03b3t) and the upregulation of Th2 activities (GATA- 3). In addition, anti-CD20 increased the expression of Foxp3. Anti-CD20 treatment can also reduce brain tissue damage after 10 days.

The study included 20,009 hospitalized HF and AKD patients who underwent dialysis during hospitalization, recovered from dialysis within 90 days after discharge, and were followed until November 30, 2022, using data from TriNetX. The study period began in July 2015, coinciding with the availability of ARNi in the market. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance ARNi and ACEi groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the risks of mortality, major adverse kidney events (MAKE), readmission and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The follow-up period was conducted with a maximum duration of 5 years. A total of 20,009 AKD patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.2] years) were enrolled, of whom 21.9% received ARNi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. After matching, 4391 patients (mean age, 58.6 years; male, 67.9%) were identified in both the ARNi and control groups. ARNi users exhibited a significantly lower risk of mortality (aHR, 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.80, p = 0.01), MAKE (aHR, 0.58, 95% CI 0.51-0.66, p < 0.01 ), and readmission (aHR, 0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.68, p <0.01) versus controls. However, no significant difference in the risk of MACE was observed between the two groups (aHR, 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.09, p = 0.78). Subgroup analysis revealed ARNi users, when concomitantly treated with mineralocorticoids, diuretics, or beta-blockers had significantly lower risks of mortality, readmission, and MAKE than the control group. In addition, ARNi significantly reduced mortality and MAKE in patients with GFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m , irrespective of proteinuria status. However, no significant benefit was observed in patients with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m . In HF patients with AKD, ARNi was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, MAKE, and readmission risks compared to ACEi, particularly with concurrent mineralocorticoids, diuretics, or beta-blockers. Future research is necessary to further investigate the impact of ARNi on outcomes in patients with HF and AKD.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Predictive models were constructed using machine learning algorithms, and tree-based feature selection was applied to evaluate the contributions of AKI and renal function indicators to mortality prediction. A total of 127 GPA patients were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression identified AKI (OR\u2009>\u20091, P\u2009<\u20090.05) as a significant predictor of 1-year mortality.

Furthermore, both patient populations show increased risk of many communicable infectious diseases and their adverse consequences, while vaccination can play a crucial role in their prevention, improving patient outcomes. Vaccination should represent a standard part of care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and both the diseases simultaneously, including people undergoing cancer treatment or in remission. Several international guidelines provide recommendations for vaccinating people with cancer or diabetes, but the two conditions have not been specifically evaluated together. Here we present a multidisciplinary consensus position paper on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. The position paper is the result of a collaborative effort between experts from the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD), Italian Society of Diabetology (SID), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and Italian Society of Pharmacology (SIF). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art knowledge on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. It discusses the importance of vaccination in preventing infections, focuses attention on the need to consider the unique challenges faced by patients with cancer and diabetes when it comes to vaccine administration, and highlights the need for coordinated care to optimize treatment outcomes.

However, the mechanism by which this effect is produced is not completely clear. In this study, we explored the involvement of TRPV1 and the MOR-NMDAR complex in the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice with neuropathic pain. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by administering streptozotocin-nicotinamide. Four weeks later, once neuropathic pain was established, the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 (56.2\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using the up-down method with the von Frey filaments, both in the absence and the presence of capsazepine (8\u00a0mg/kg, ip), naloxone (NLX, 1\u00a0mg/kg, ip), NMDA (0.4 nM/10 \u00b5L, it), or their co-administration (NLX-NMDA). Gabapentin was used as positive control. Pretreatment with NLX did not alter the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in the up-down method with the von Frey filaments in hyperglycemic mice, whereas NMDA significantly reduced it. The addition of NLX to NMDA (NLX-NMDA) did not modify the effect of NMDA alone on the antiallodynic activity of LMH-2. Additionally, capsazepine completely blocked the antinociceptive effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice. Molecular docking analysis suggested a potential interaction between LMH-2 and TRPV1. Moreover, a higher dose of LMH-2 did not cause mortality or damage in healthy mice. These results suggest the potential utility of LMH-2 in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and highlight a key role for TRPV1 in LMH-2's antiallodynic mechanism, along with a possible, albeit limited, interaction with the MOR/NMDA complex.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Resistance and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics are continually on the rise, and vaccines remain in development. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on prophage contribution to the epidemiology of GBS isolates from humans in South America. In the context of an Argentinian multicentric study, we had previously phenotypically characterized 365 human GBS isolates from invasive disease, urinary infections and maternal colonization. These isolates had been whole-genome sequenced, and their prophage presence was bioinformatically determined. In this study, we genomically characterized the isolates and analysed the prophage content in the context of the epidemiological data. The phylogenetic analysis of the 365 genomes with 103 GBS from public databases revealed that Argentinian GBS were related to isolates from around the world. The most prevalent lineages, independent of the isolated source, were CC23/Ia and CC12/Ib. Genes encoding virulence factors involved in immune response evasion, tissue damage and adherence to host tissues, and invasion were found in all of the genomes in accordance with previously described lineage distribution. According to the prevalent capsular types and the distribution of specific virulence factors in Argentinian GBS, over 95% coverage would be expected from the vaccines currently under development. Antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) to at least one antibiotic class were found in 90% of the genomes, including novel mutations in  2x, while more than 15% carried ARDs to three or more classes. GBS collected from urinary infections carried a significantly higher proportion of ARDs to multiple antibiotic classes than the rest of the isolates. A total of 454 prophages were found among the 468 genomes analysed, which were classified into 23 prophage types. Prophage presence exhibited variations based on GBS clonal complex and capsular type. A possible association between an increased GBS pathogenicity and the carriage of prophages with integrase type GBS 8 and/or the presence of genes that encode the Phox Homology domain has been observed. The highest prevalence of prophages per genome was found in lineages CC17/III and CC19/III, while the lowest amount was observed in CC12/Ib. Overall, the highest density of prophages, virulence factors and ARDs determinants was found in CC19 isolates, mostly of capsular type III, independent of the isolates' source.

This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations. Distinguishing direct effects of changes in consumption from one drug to another from common but unrelated responses to external events remains a challenge, as there are many factors that can influence consumption. The findings provide a better understanding of the interdependencies in the consumption of the most commonly prescribed antibacterial drugs, improving the understanding of potential influencing factors to support strategies for rational prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

Ninety-five patients with glaucoma underwent Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and driving simulations every 6 months. Rates of VF loss were estimated by changes in mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular VF over time. Driving performance was assessed using a simulator by maintaining lane position on a winding road while responding to peripheral visual stimuli to assess divided attention. Reaction time (RT) recorded the duration between the presentation of the stimuli and the participant's response. Linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes in SAP MS and mean RT. Multivariable linear regression models were used to predict driving performance, adjusting for age, cognitive impairment, and driving exposure. Progressive VF loss was associated with a longitudinal increase in mean RT to the divided attention task.

This study aimed to develop a mathematical model to represent the anatomical localization and functional organization of the insula, drawing on current neuroimaging findings and established anatomical data. A three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid model was constructed to mathematically represent the anatomical boundaries of the insula using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate data. This geometric model adapts the ellipsoid equation to reflect the spatial configuration of the insula and is primarily based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and anatomical literature. Relevant findings from prior imaging research, particularly those reporting microstructural variations across insular subdivisions, were reviewed and conceptually integrated to guide the model's structural assumptions and interpretation of potential applications. The ellipsoid-based 3D model accurately represented the anatomical dimensions and spatial localization of the right insula, centered at the MNI coordinates (40, 5, 5\u00a0mm), and matched well with the known volumetric data. Functional regions (face, hand, and foot) were successfully plotted within the model, and statistical analysis confirmed significant differences along the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively). Dynamic simulations revealed oscillatory patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity, consistent with established insular neurophysiology. Additionally, connectivity modeling demonstrated strong bidirectional interactions between the insula and key regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), reflecting its integrative role in brain networks.

When immature, they take up and process antigens efficiently. When mature, they express high levels of MHC class I and II molecules and costimulatory molecules on their surface and secrete both IL-12 and IL-15 that can activate and steer T cells. However, in patients with cancer or tumor-bearing animals, cancers secrete cytokines that suppress DC development or maturation. To circumvent this barrier to immunization against cancer, strategies have been developed to grow and mature DCs ex vivo from precursors, such as peripheral blood monocytes or bone marrow precursors, induce expression of tumor antigens ex vivo, and then administer the autologous DCs to the patient as a vaccine. The DCs may be coated with synthetic antigenic peptides or transduced with a virus expressing the tumor antigen (see Note 1). Both of these have been used in early clinical trials with promising immunogenicity. Such cancer vaccines may be especially critical for \"cold\" tumors that do not induce a sufficient immune response by themselves to be amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy or blockade of other negative regulators of immunity but with a cancer vaccine to induce the immune response, may become responsive to such immunotherapies. Conversely, cancer vaccines should become more effective if immunosuppressive mechanisms are blocked. Thus, the two approaches should synergize to optimize anticancer immune responses and reject the cancer like an allogeneic organ transplant.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"}

However, little is known about the variation in outcomes for patients with DFUs according to the health care facilities treating them. To examine facility-level variation in major leg amputation among veterans with incident DFUs using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cohort. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021, of all veterans with a new diagnosis of DFU at 140 VHA facilities across the US. Patients were followed up to 1 year from DFU diagnosis. Analyses were conducted between March 22, 2024, and January 13, 2025. A facility was assigned to each patient corresponding to the health care site where the initial DFU diagnosis was made. The primary outcome was major leg amputation during the follow-up period. A multivariable mixed-effects regression model with random facility intercepts was applied to assess variation in major leg amputation rates across facilities, adjusting for social drivers of health, comorbidities, and complicated DFU at initial diagnosis. The median odds ratio (MOR) was calculated to quantify facility-level variation in outcomes. A total of 86\u202f094 veterans (98.3% male; mean [SD] age, 73.0 [8.1] years; age range, 55-102 years) were included. Major leg amputation was performed for 3279 veterans (3.8%) within a year of DFU diagnosis. The MOR for facility-level variation in major leg amputation was 1.85, indicating that the odds of major leg amputation were 1.85 times higher between 2 randomly selected facilities for an average patient (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

A total of 393 patients (306 males) with a mean age of 38 years (range 15-87 years) were included. Of these, 24 patients (6%) had diabetes and 126 patients (32%) were smokers. There were 78 (20%) type I fractures, 170 (43%) type II fractures, and 144 (37%) type III fractures. Of the type III fractures, 99 (68%) were type IIIA while 45 (32%) were type IIIB. A total of 32 patients (8%) were treated within 6 hours, 111 patients (28%) between 6 and 12 hours, 131 patients (33%) between 12 and 18 hours, 69 patients (18%) between 18 and 24 hours, and 50 patients (13%) after 24 hours. A total of 46 infections (12.5%) were observed: 6 infections (13%) in type I fractures, 14 infections (20%) in type II fractures, 10 infections (22%) in type IIIA fractures, and 16 infections (35%) in type IIIB fractures. Time to surgery was not predictive of infection (p=0.31). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with a type IIIB fracture were 6.1 times more likely to develop an infection compared to other fracture types (OR = 6.147, 95% CI: 1.975- 19.129, p = 0.002). Smokers were 2.8 times more likely to develop an infection (OR = 2.779, 95% CI: 1.357-5.691, P = 0.005). Age, time to debridement at the specified time points, diabetes, and ASA classification did not significantly predict infection (p = 0.32, 0.31, 0.27, and 0.50, respectively). Smoking and type IIIB fractures were identified as significant predictors of infection following immediate medullary nailing of open tibial shaft fractures, whereas time to debridement, within the categorized time points, was not found to be a significant factor.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Furthermore, both patient populations show increased risk of many communicable infectious diseases and their adverse consequences, while vaccination can play a crucial role in their prevention, improving patient outcomes. Vaccination should represent a standard part of care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and both the diseases simultaneously, including people undergoing cancer treatment or in remission. Several international guidelines provide recommendations for vaccinating people with cancer or diabetes, but the two conditions have not been specifically evaluated together. Here we present a multidisciplinary consensus position paper on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. The position paper is the result of a collaborative effort between experts from the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD), Italian Society of Diabetology (SID), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and Italian Society of Pharmacology (SIF). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art knowledge on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. It discusses the importance of vaccination in preventing infections, focuses attention on the need to consider the unique challenges faced by patients with cancer and diabetes when it comes to vaccine administration, and highlights the need for coordinated care to optimize treatment outcomes.

When immature, they take up and process antigens efficiently. When mature, they express high levels of MHC class I and II molecules and costimulatory molecules on their surface and secrete both IL-12 and IL-15 that can activate and steer T cells. However, in patients with cancer or tumor-bearing animals, cancers secrete cytokines that suppress DC development or maturation. To circumvent this barrier to immunization against cancer, strategies have been developed to grow and mature DCs ex vivo from precursors, such as peripheral blood monocytes or bone marrow precursors, induce expression of tumor antigens ex vivo, and then administer the autologous DCs to the patient as a vaccine. The DCs may be coated with synthetic antigenic peptides or transduced with a virus expressing the tumor antigen (see Note 1). Both of these have been used in early clinical trials with promising immunogenicity. Such cancer vaccines may be especially critical for \"cold\" tumors that do not induce a sufficient immune response by themselves to be amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy or blockade of other negative regulators of immunity but with a cancer vaccine to induce the immune response, may become responsive to such immunotherapies. Conversely, cancer vaccines should become more effective if immunosuppressive mechanisms are blocked. Thus, the two approaches should synergize to optimize anticancer immune responses and reject the cancer like an allogeneic organ transplant.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"},

However, the mechanism by which this effect is produced is not completely clear. In this study, we explored the involvement of TRPV1 and the MOR-NMDAR complex in the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice with neuropathic pain. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by administering streptozotocin-nicotinamide. Four weeks later, once neuropathic pain was established, the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 (56.2\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using the up-down method with the von Frey filaments, both in the absence and the presence of capsazepine (8\u00a0mg/kg, ip), naloxone (NLX, 1\u00a0mg/kg, ip), NMDA (0.4 nM/10 \u00b5L, it), or their co-administration (NLX-NMDA). Gabapentin was used as positive control. Pretreatment with NLX did not alter the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in the up-down method with the von Frey filaments in hyperglycemic mice, whereas NMDA significantly reduced it. The addition of NLX to NMDA (NLX-NMDA) did not modify the effect of NMDA alone on the antiallodynic activity of LMH-2. Additionally, capsazepine completely blocked the antinociceptive effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice. Molecular docking analysis suggested a potential interaction between LMH-2 and TRPV1. Moreover, a higher dose of LMH-2 did not cause mortality or damage in healthy mice.

Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Resistance and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics are continually on the rise, and vaccines remain in development. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on prophage contribution to the epidemiology of GBS isolates from humans in South America. In the context of an Argentinian multicentric study, we had previously phenotypically characterized 365 human GBS isolates from invasive disease, urinary infections and maternal colonization. These isolates had been whole-genome sequenced, and their prophage presence was bioinformatically determined. In this study, we genomically characterized the isolates and analysed the prophage content in the context of the epidemiological data. The phylogenetic analysis of the 365 genomes with 103 GBS from public databases revealed that Argentinian GBS were related to isolates from around the world. The most prevalent lineages, independent of the isolated source, were CC23/Ia and CC12/Ib. Genes encoding virulence factors involved in immune response evasion, tissue damage and adherence to host tissues, and invasion were found in all of the genomes in accordance with previously described lineage distribution. According to the prevalent capsular types and the distribution of specific virulence factors in Argentinian GBS, over 95% coverage would be expected from the vaccines currently under development. Antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) to at least one antibiotic class were found in 90% of the genomes, including novel mutations in  2x, while more than 15% carried ARDs to three or more classes. GBS collected from urinary infections carried a significantly higher proportion of ARDs to multiple antibiotic classes than the rest of the isolates. A total of 454 prophages were found among the 468 genomes analysed, which were classified into 23 prophage types. Prophage presence exhibited variations based on GBS clonal complex and capsular type. A possible association between an increased GBS pathogenicity and the carriage of prophages with integrase type GBS 8 and/or the presence of genes that encode the Phox Homology domain has been observed. The highest prevalence of prophages per genome was found in lineages CC17/III and CC19/III, while the lowest amount was observed in CC12/Ib. Overall, the highest density of prophages, virulence factors and ARDs determinants was found in CC19 isolates, mostly of capsular type III, independent of the isolates' source.

This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations.

Fimbriae are important virulence factors involved in biofilm formation and adhesion to host cells. Their exposed location, conservation among clinical isolates and adjuvant properties make them interesting candidates for inclusion in protein-based vaccines. Therefore, the present work investigated the immunological potential of type 1 and 3 fimbriae subunits in a murine model of   lung infection. MrkA and FimA were produced as recombinant proteins in  , purified and used to immunize mice subcutaneously. The immune responses were characterized and protection against pneumonia was evaluated after intranasal challenge. Subcutaneous immunization with recombinant FimA and MrkA induced high IgG1 production; the antibodies efficiently recognized the native proteins at the bacterial surface, promoted C3 deposition and reduced biofilm formation by   in vitro. Mice vaccinated with the co-administered proteins reduced the bacterial loads in the lungs after intranasal challenge, less inflammation and reduced tissue damage.

Ninety-five patients with glaucoma underwent Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and driving simulations every 6 months. Rates of VF loss were estimated by changes in mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular VF over time. Driving performance was assessed using a simulator by maintaining lane position on a winding road while responding to peripheral visual stimuli to assess divided attention. Reaction time (RT) recorded the duration between the presentation of the stimuli and the participant's response. Linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes in SAP MS and mean RT. Multivariable linear regression models were used to predict driving performance, adjusting for age, cognitive impairment, and driving exposure. Progressive VF loss was associated with a longitudinal increase in mean RT to the divided attention task. In the multivariable model, each 1 decibel (dB)/year faster loss of integrated binocular MS was associated with a 0.024 logarithms (ln) s/year increase in mean RT (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.007 to 0.042, P = 0.008).

Although several studies have described its anatomical and functional characteristics, mathematical models that quantitatively represent the insula's complex structure and connectivity are lacking. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model to represent the anatomical localization and functional organization of the insula, drawing on current neuroimaging findings and established anatomical data. A three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid model was constructed to mathematically represent the anatomical boundaries of the insula using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate data. This geometric model adapts the ellipsoid equation to reflect the spatial configuration of the insula and is primarily based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and anatomical literature. Relevant findings from prior imaging research, particularly those reporting microstructural variations across insular subdivisions, were reviewed and conceptually integrated to guide the model's structural assumptions and interpretation of potential applications. The ellipsoid-based 3D model accurately represented the anatomical dimensions and spatial localization of the right insula, centered at the MNI coordinates (40, 5, 5\u00a0mm), and matched well with the known volumetric data. Functional regions (face, hand, and foot) were successfully plotted within the model, and statistical analysis confirmed significant differences along the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively).

Emergency department (ED) visits serve as critical access points within health care and present a unique opportunity for hypertension screening and intervention. To evaluate the effectiveness of an Education and mHealth Empowerment (E2) intervention compared with usual care in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) among patients with elevated BP discharged from the ED. This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who presented to an urban academic medical center ED for any indication and had elevated blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mm Hg and \u2264180/110 mm Hg). Eligible participants who were discharged from the ED were enrolled between February 12, 2019, and March 31, 2023, and were randomized to receive either usual care or the intervention with follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. Usual care involved standard hypertension discharge instructions with a referral for outpatient follow-up. The E2 intervention involved a 3-prong approach, which included a brief Post-Acute Care Hypertension consultation (PACHT-c) with a clinical pharmacist or an advanced practice nurse, a smartphone-enabled BP monitoring kit (Withings device and mobile app) for daily self-monitoring along with behavior change text messages, and primary care referral. The primary outcome was the mean change in SBP (mm Hg) from baseline to 6 months. Of the 574 participants enrolled, mean (SD) age was 51.1 (12.5) years, and 323 (56%) were female; 413 were Black (72%), 115 were Hispanic or Latino (20%), 27 were White (5%), and 19 were other race and ethnicity (3%), which included Asian, American Indian, and other racial or ethnic groups. Of the 413 patients with BP data at 6 months, the E2 intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009210) showed a greater mean reduction in SBP (mean difference, 4.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8-9.0 mm Hg; P\u2009=\u2009.02) compared with the usual-care group (n\u2009=\u2009203). A similar proportion of patients achieved BP less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg at 6 months in the intervention arm (42.9% [90 of 210]) and the control arm (36.9% [75 of 203]; P\u2009=\u2009.22). In this single-center randomized clinical trial, a multicomponent intervention directed at patients in the ED who have elevated BP was associated with greater reduction in SBP at 6 months. Identifying patients who present to the ED with hypertension may be a viable strategy to improve BP management.

Understanding how cumulative CVH over time influences later-life CVD and mortality may aid early prevention. To determine whether cumulative CVH, as measured by the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 (LE8) from age 18 to 45 years, is associated with incident CVD and mortality in midlife. This cohort study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, collected CVH data for participants from 4 US centers from 1985 to 2020. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations of (1) cumulative LE8 score by quartile, (2) cumulative LE8 score and score at age 45 years, and (3) cumulative LE8 score and LE8 score slope from age 18 to 45 years with incident CVD and mortality after age 45 years. Incident CVD and all-cause mortality. Cumulative LE8 score was calculated as the area under the curve of the LE8 score (0-100, higher is better CVH) over time from age 18 to 45 years. There were 4832 CARDIA participants (2690 [55.7%] female and 2142 [44.3%] male) with a mean (SD) cumulative LE8 score from age 18 to 45 years of 2018.8 (95.0) point\u2009\u00d7\u2009years. Compared with quartile 1 (Q1, ie, lowest CVH), Q2, Q3, and Q4 had significantly lower hazards for CVD (Q2 HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.32-0.61; Q3 HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.18-0.38; Q4 HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.07-0.21) and mortality (Q2 HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.71; Q3 HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26-0.55; Q4 HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.18-0.45) after age 45 years. When cumulative LE8 score from age 18 to 45 years and LE8 score at age 45 years were in the model together, both were significantly associated with lower risk for CVD. Likewise, both cumulative LE8 score and positive slope of (improving) LE8 score from age 18 to 45 years were significantly associated with lower hazards for incident CVD after age 45 years. Greater cumulative CVH and improvement in CVH during young adulthood, as well as better CVH in middle age, were all independently associated with lower risk for incident CVD in midlife. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining and improving CVH throughout young adulthood.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

This was a cross-sectional study in 96 eyes of 67 patients, including controls, diabetes without DR (DMnoDR), nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and proliferative DR (PDR) groups. Participants underwent same-day quantitative contrast sensitivity function (qCSF) and 6 \u00d7 6 mm OCT angiography (OCTA) centered on the optic disc. The Peripapillary Nerve Fiber Layer Microvasculature Density algorithm (ARI Network) was used to calculate capillary perfusion density (total area of perfused microvasculature per unit area), capillary flux index (CFI, total weighted area of perfused microvasculature per unit area), and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness surrounding the optic disc. Mixed-effects multivariable regression models, controlling for age, hypertension, and lens status, evaluated associations between RPC OCTA metrics, DR severity, VA, and qCSF. Significant RPC microvascular changes were observed across DR stages. Capillary perfusion density decreased with DR severity and even before retinopathy onset in DMnoDR versus controls (\u03b2avg = -0.42, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). PDR compared to NPDR showed a significant decrease in CFI (\u03b2 = -1.02 to -0.92, P < 0.01) and in RNFL (\u03b2avg = -0.71, P\u00a0=\u00a00.033).

Decreased SPP in lower extremities is associated with poor survival in maintenance haemodialysis (HD) patients. Nevertheless, the prognostic significance of SPP at HD initiation has not been determined. We investigated the relation between SPP and death or cardiovascular disease (CVD) in incident HD patients. Data were collected retrospectively from patients with SPP measurements taken by dialysis nurses at HD initiation during 2020-2023. Then we assessed the association between the minimum value of SPP in the bilateral dorsal/plantar portions of each patient (SPPmin) and outcomes, consisting of mortality and CVDs within 1\u00a0year after HD initiation. This study examined 104 incident HD patients with a median age of 74 (79% male). Based on the suggested cut-off value from receiver operating characteristic analysis, patients were divided into two groups: patients with SPPmin\u2009\u2265\u200960\u00a0mmHg (higher SPPmin) and those with SPPmin\u2009<\u200960\u00a0mmHg (lower SPPmin). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated the 1-year survival and CVD-free rate as significantly lower in the lower SPPmin group than in the higher SPPmin group (p\u2009<\u2009.001). Cox proportional hazards analyses showed lower SPPmin as associated with the composite outcome. The relation between lower SPPmin and outcome held true in each subgroup with cardiovascular risk such as older age and history of CVD.

Anti-CD20 treatments have a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we investigated the effect of anti-CD20 on IS-induced inflammation and histopathologic changes in the rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and stroke. Rats in the stroke groups underwent photothrombosis-induced IS in the sensorimotor cortex area. They were divided into the following subgroups: treated with anti-CD20 after ischemia and killed after 5 and/or 10 days of IS. Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA levels of inflammation markers (VIM, ANXA3, SLC22 A4, and ADM), and also levels of transcription factors for Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets (Tbet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3, respectively), and also Foxp3 were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of ADM and SLC22 A4 increased following IS on the 5th and 10th days, while treatment with anti-CD20 reversed their levels. Anti-CD20 therapy attenuated inflammation through down-regulation of VIM and ANXA3 after 10 days. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the downregulation of Th1-Th17-driven inflammatory responses (Tbet and ROR\u03b3t) and the upregulation of Th2 activities (GATA- 3). In addition, anti-CD20 increased the expression of Foxp3. Anti-CD20 treatment can also reduce brain tissue damage after 10 days. Our data showed that inflammation and histopathological alterations are associated with the photothrombotic model of IS, while treatment with anti-CD20 could reduce inflammation and alleviate histopathological changes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

This study investigated the outcomes of ARNi compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) in HF patients with AKD. The study included 20,009 hospitalized HF and AKD patients who underwent dialysis during hospitalization, recovered from dialysis within 90 days after discharge, and were followed until November 30, 2022, using data from TriNetX. The study period began in July 2015, coinciding with the availability of ARNi in the market. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance ARNi and ACEi groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the risks of mortality, major adverse kidney events (MAKE), readmission and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The follow-up period was conducted with a maximum duration of 5 years. A total of 20,009 AKD patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.2] years) were enrolled, of whom 21.9% received ARNi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years.
