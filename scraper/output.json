  "abstract": "Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are rare, chronic conditions characterized by blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder in which autoantibodies target coagulation factor VIII, often associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of AIBD and AHA is rare, with limited understanding of their combined impacts. We aimed to synthesize the available evidence and provide insights into clinical manifestations, treatment strategies, and survival outcomes of such patients. We searched for relevant literature in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus, and combined patient information from our hospital to provide a comprehensive analysis. A total of 80 patients were included. Through log-rank tests, older age (p = 0.03) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) (p = 0.047) were associated with shorter survival time. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, mortality was only associated with older age (HR: 1.13, p = 0.02). Patients presenting both AIBD and AHA exhibit intricate clinical presentations and are at risk of severe, potentially fatal outcomes. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding bleeding in AIBD patients, particularly those with BP and those in the geriatric population.",

  "abstract": "Delayed healing of corneal epithelial injury can cause irreversible scarring and severely affect vision. Outstanding progress has been made in recent years regarding corneal epithelial repair. However, studies investigating the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in this process remain limited. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of m6A modification and its regulators in the healing of the corneal epithelium. In this study, we used the C57BL/6 mouse corneal alkali burn model as an in vivo model and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) as an in vitro subject. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of YTHDF2, METTL3, and FTO in HCECs. We evaluated the effects of downregulating m6A modification regulators on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCECs under basal conditions and following IL-1β stimulation. The results suggest that m6A and its regulators are involved in the healing process of the corneal epithelium. Following corneal alkali burns, m6A levels were elevated, while the expression of METTL3, FTO, and YTHDF2 was reduced. In HCECs stimulated with IL-1β, m6A levels were significantly increased, and the expression of FTO and YTHDF2 was decreased. Silencing METTL3 and YTHDF2 enhanced the proliferation and migration of HCECs by increasing HSP70 expression, thereby facilitating corneal epithelial healing. In contrast, silencing FTO may impede corneal epithelial healing by promoting apoptosis in HCECs and inhibiting their proliferation and migration. This study offers a novel perspective on the treatment of delayed corneal epithelial healing.",

  "abstract": "Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are crucial for maintaining cutaneous functions under various pathological conditions, including wounds. Tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) interacts with its receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), and plays a role in the development and tissue repair of skin diseases. This study aims to elucidate the effects of TWEAK/Fn14 signalling on HFSCs and the associated mechanisms. The expressions of HFSC markers, including K19, integrin β1 and K15, were analysed via immunohistochemistry in normal and Fn14-deficient mouse skin. Primary HFSCs were cultured in vitro and then treated with TWEAK or a chemokine (CXC motif) (CXCR) 4 inhibitor. The phenotype markers and secreted cytokines of HFSCs were assessed via immunofluorescence analysis, Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that both Fn14 and CXCR4 were highly expressed in hair follicles. Fn14 deficiency led to a decrease in the expression levels of K19 and CD34. Exogenous TWEAK enhanced the expression of K15, K19, integrin β1, tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 and CXCR4 in cultured HFSCs. Additionally, TWEAK induced the proliferation, migration and cytokine production in HFSCs. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway was upregulated in HFSCs upon TWEAK stimulation, and inhibitors of β-catenin or CXCR4 suppressed the effects of TWEAK on the differentiation and secretory functions of HFSCs. In conclusion, TWEAK/Fn14 interaction regulates the expression of differentiation markers and secretory functions of HFSCs in vitro. Wnt/β-catenin signalling or CXCR4 activation mediates the effects of TWEAK on HFSCs. Targeting the Fn14-Wnt/β-catenin-CXCR4 signalling axis may offer a potential approach for managing HFSC-related skin diseases, such as wounds.",

  "abstract": "Chronic urticaria (CU) treatment with omalizumab is considered safe in short-term studies. Large real-world studies focusing on the long-term safety of omalizumab and associated factors are lacking. We aimed to investigate the spectrum of reported side effects in omalizumab-treated CU patients in a large long-term daily practice cohort. A multinational multicentre retrospective study was conducted at 14 specialised urticaria centres (UCAREs), including all CU patients ever treated with omalizumab until centre-specific data lock. The prevalence of patient-reported side effects was assessed. A total of 1859 patients were included, of which 32.9% (n = 612) reported side effects during omalizumab treatment with a wide range across centres (0%-75.5%). Fatigue (15.8%, n = 293), headache (11.6%, n = 215) and flu-like symptoms (9.3%, n = 172) were most common. No events suggestive of anaphylaxis and no new notably prevalent side effects were reported. Hair loss was reported by 2.9% (n = 53/1859) of patients, leading to treatment adjustment in 21.1% (n = 8/38 with sufficient data). Patients who reported side effects were more often female (78.3% vs. 68.6%, p < 0.001), had worse disease control prior to omalizumab (Urticaria Control Test, UCT, 4.0 vs. 6.0, p < 0.001), and lower fast response (Weekly Urticaria Activity Score, UAS7, < 7 or UCT > 11 within 4 weeks, 42.6% vs. 59.5%, p < 0.001) and complete/good response rates (UAS7 < 7 or UCT > 11 at end of treatment, 72.3% vs. 84.4%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without side effects. While only 2.4% (n = 44/1859) of patients discontinued treatment due to side effects, 5.5% (n = 100/1859) and 12.8% (n = 238/1859) of patients reporting side effects with insufficient (UAS7 ≥ 7 or UCT 3-11 at end of treatment) and complete/good response, respectively, remained on omalizumab. The safety and tolerability of omalizumab was confirmed. Notably, the wide variation in reported side effects across centres suggests that differences in awareness influence reporting. Hair loss was more prevalent than described before, warranting extra attention. Side effects were more often reported in patients whose characteristics suggest reduced effectiveness of omalizumab, possibly related to a negative association with omalizumab and suggesting increased disease burden. Availability of new therapies might increase the impact of side effects on treatment decisions, not only in omalizumab-refractory patients but potentially even among good responders.",

The purpose of this study is to determine whether moxibustion acupuncture is effective in accelerating Bell's palsy patients' recovery and compare the recovery rates of patients with and without diabetes mellitus. 102 patients with Bell's palsy participated in the current study. Their ages ranged from 12 to 73. They were randomly classified into an experimental group (A) of 52 patients who received moxibustion acupuncture and a control group (B) of 50 patients who received medications only. The HOUSE BRACKMANN GRADING system was used before the session, after 3 weeks, and after 6 weeks. Within-group comparison, there was a statistically significant reduction in the House Brackmann (HB) scores of group A and group B at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment compared with that pre-treatment (p < 0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in HB of groups A and B at 6 weeks compared with 3 weeks post-treatment (p < 0.001). on the other hand, the between-groups comparison showed a statistically significant reduction in HB of group A compared with that of group B at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment intervention (p < 0.001).

  "abstract": "Cupping therapy is widely recognized for its effects on various health conditions. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying its benefits remain speculative and unproven. To propose a hypothesis that explains the physiological mechanisms of dry cupping therapy based on clinical evidence, addressing gaps in existing hypotheses. A case study was conducted involving five patients subjected to dry cupping on different body parts for varying durations. The serum extracted from incidental blisters formed during the procedure was analyzed biochemically and microscopically. Biochemical analysis revealed that the creatinine levels in the blister serum were double those in sweat, indicating muscular involvement even when venous level was normal. These findings suggest that dry cupping primarily affects the skin through processes such as transduction, conduction, and transmission, with secondary effects on muscles. The muscular response to dry cupping induces the release of myokines, which initiate an inflammatory response that contributes to the systemic effects of the therapy. This hypothesis offers a plausible explanation for the physiological mechanisms of dry cupping therapy, emphasizing the interplay between skin and muscle responses and their systemic implications. Further research is needed to validate this hypothesis and explore its clinical relevance.",

  "abstract": "Factors associated with vitiligo burden in patients with darker skin (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI) are not fully understood. This analysis of patients in the global VALIANT study examined the quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial health among patients with vitiligo by skin type. Participants from 17 countries were surveyed regarding their clinical characteristics, everyday experiences with vitiligo, impact of vitiligo on daily activities, emotional well-being, and mental health. Of 3541 surveyed patients, 40.8% (n = 1445) had darker skin versus 59.2% (n = 2096) with fairer skin (types I-III). Patients with darker skin had greater median disease extent than those with fairer skin (6.6% vs 2.5%; P < 0.0001). Mean Vitiligo Impact Patient scale scores were higher among patients with darker skin (31.2 vs 24.5; P < 0.0001); daily activities and emotional well-being were significantly more impacted among patients with darker skin. Among individual skin types, patients with types V and VI expressed considerably higher rates of burden versus all other skin types in all assessments. Interestingly, among patients with fairer skin, those with skin type I reported higher rates of burden than those with skin types II and III. Patients with darker skin, particularly skin types V and VI, were more impacted in their daily lives, emotional well-being, and mental health than those with fairer skin, suggesting that a disproportionate need for strategies to improve QoL and mental health burden exists among patients with vitiligo who have skin of color. Vitiligo is a disease that causes white patches to appear on the skin. The study described here analyzed whether vitiligo is more difficult for people with darker skin. To answer this question, the authors used data from a large patient survey called the VALIANT study. Over 3000 people living with vitiligo from 17 countries responded to the survey, and close to half had darker skin. People with darker skin tended to report that larger areas of their body were covered in white patches, suggesting that people with fairer skin may underestimate the extent of their vitiligo. In addition, people with darker skin reported a worse effect on their daily life than those with fairer skin; were more likely to be discouraged and worried about their disease spreading; and were more likely to feel that their vitiligo affected what clothes they wore or what activities they participated in. People with darker skin reported more difficulty with their careers and were more likely to be anxious or depressed. Even among people with darker skin (three types), effects of vitiligo were worst among those with the darkest skin. These results show that vitiligo is a difficult disease for all people living with vitiligo, but the burden is most amplified among people with darker skin.",

  "abstract": "Cosmetic blepharoplasty is the most common plastic surgery procedures in East Asian and also one of the procedures most prone to unsatisfactory outcomes. The crease width is a crucial aesthetic criterion for individuals seeking aesthetic enhancements, and due to the various influencing factors, the outcomes of blepharoplasty tend to be unpredictable. We assessed the apparent height of the double eyelid, incision width, levator muscle function, palpebral fissure height, skin-orbicularis oculi muscle thickness, upper eyelid tissue thickness, and age of Asian women aged 18-35 seeking aesthetic enhancements one-year post-blepharoplasty. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the apparent height of the double eyelid and other variables. The study revealed a correlation between the apparent width of the double eyelid and the incision width, levator muscle function, skin-orbicularis oculi muscle thickness, eyelid tissue thickness, and age (standardized regression coefficients were 0.423, - 0.566, 0.156, - 0.332, and 0.235, respectively), but not with palpebral fissure height. The multiple regression model had an adjusted R square of 0.695. The apparent crease width following blepharoplasty is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, it is essential for the operating physician to comprehensively evaluate the levator muscle function, upper eyelid puffiness, and age of the individual seeking aesthetic enhancement before the surgery. Personalizing the design of the surgical incision height during the procedure is crucial to achieve the desired double eyelid width and morphology.

We systematically reviewed the available literature regarding nonsurgical temporal volumization with injectable fillers. On Sept 16, 2024, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases were queried with relevant terms for all articles describing temporal volumization with injectable fillers, including those with temple-specific data within the context of full-face volumization. Studies unrelated to temporal volumization, using autologous fat or its derivatives, limited to temporal lifting via injection into the temporoparietal scalp, without novel clinical/patient data, or unavailable in English were excluded. Database query yielded 680 unique articles. One additional article was found with citation searching. After screening and evaluation for duplicates and inclusion/exclusion criteria, 40 articles were included. Nineteen studies were prospective and 21 studies were retrospective, of which 9 were complication case reports. A total of 881 patients were treated with either hyaluronic acid (n = 783), calcium hydroxylapatite (n = 93), polymethylmethacrylate (n = 28), allograft adipose matrix (n = 10), and poly-L-lactic acid (n = 2).

  "abstract": "Our objective was to investigate the accuracy of prenatal diagnoses of congenital lung malformations (CLM) compared to postnatal diagnoses in a population in northern Finland and to estimate the birth prevalence of CLMs in the same population. A retrospective review of all CLM cases in a tertiary referral center, Oulu University Hospital, Finland, in 2010-2020. Data were collected from medical records. The final postnatal diagnosis was recorded as the pathologic-anatomic diagnosis, if available, and otherwise as the postnatal radiologic diagnosis. Our case series comprises 37 CLM cases. The prenatal detection rate of CLMs was 100%. The prenatal diagnosis was congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) in 34/37 cases (92%). The accuracy of prenatal CLM diagnoses was 60% compared to postnatal radiologic diagnoses and 51% compared to final postnatal diagnoses. Relative frequencies of different diagnoses in postnatally confirmed CLM cases were CPAM 47% (16/34 cases), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) 15% (5/34), hybrid CPAM/BPS 15% (5/34), congenital lobar overinflation (CLO) 15% (5/34), bronchial atresia 6% (2/34), and bronchogenic cyst 3% (1/34). Postnatally confirmed cases of CPAM were more likely to have a higher CPAM-volume ratio at diagnosis (p = 0.002), a higher maximum CPAM-volume ratio during pregnancy (p < 0.001), macrocystic appearance on ultrasonography (p = 0.026), and mediastinal shift (p < 0.001) compared with the rest of the cases in this study. The prevalence of all CLMs combined was 3.71 cases per 10 000 live births. The prevalences of CPAM, BPS, hybrid CPAM/BPS, and CLO were 1.69, 0.56, 0.56, and 0.56 cases per 10 000 live births, respectively. We found that all CLMs were detected prenatally, but almost half of the prenatal diagnoses were inaccurate compared to postnatal diagnoses. Most lesions were diagnosed prenatally as CPAM, but postnatally many of them turned out to be BPS, hybrid CPAM/BPS, or CLO. Postnatally confirmed CPAM cases were more likely to have a high CPAM-volume ratio, mediastinal shift, and macrocystic appearance on prenatal ultrasonography compared with other CLMs. The prevalence of CLMs is still relatively poorly documented, but we provide new estimates in Finland.",

A total of 38 women, aged 18-45 years, were recruited from a private rehabilitation center specializing in sports health, and divided into two groups: runners (n = 19) and sedentary women (n = 19). Thickness measurements, using suprapubic ultrasongraphy in B-Mode, of the EO, IO, TrA and RA muscles were taken at rest and during active contraction. Location of the bladder neck at rest and during pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction was taken with the transducer located suprapubically in M-Mode. There were no significant differences in EO TrA or RA muscle thickness at rest and during muscle contraction between runners and controls. For the IO muscle, significant differences were observed during ASLR, with runners showing greater muscle thickness (p = 0.032). Bladder neck displacement during a voluntary PFM contraction demonstrated statistically larger cranial movement for the runners of mean 0.76 ± 0.31 cm than mean 0.40 ± 0.26 cm for the sedentary group (p = 0.001). regular running is associated with increased thickness of the IO during ASLR, and significantly greater cranial bladder neck displacement during PFM contraction.",

A 31-year-old G4P2012 was referred for fetal ventriculomegaly identified during routine first-trimester ultrasound. Comprehensive fetal evaluation included serial imaging, fetal echocardiography, and whole genome sequencing. Genetic counseling and multidisciplinary care were provided throughout the pregnancy. Imaging confirmed progressive, severe ventriculomegaly without evidence of neural tube defect or cardiac abnormality. Whole genome sequencing revealed a novel de novo heterozygous c.689C>A, p.(Ala230Asp) variant in TGFBR1, classified as likely pathogenic. The patient underwent cesarean delivery at 37w1d due to significant macrocephaly. Postnatal findings included Dandy-Walker malformation requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt, unilateral retinal detachment, and focal seizures. Postnatal echocardiogram was normal. Dysmorphic features and clinical findings were consistent with LDS1. This case expands the prenatal phenotype associated with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome type 1, demonstrating that severe ventriculomegaly and macrocephaly may be early markers of disease. Early identification of LDS1 through advanced prenatal imaging and genetic testing may support anticipatory guidance and multidisciplinary care planning.",

  "abstract": "Predicting preeclampsia (PE) within the first 16 weeks of gestation is difficult due to various risk factors, poorly understood causes and likely multiple pathogenic phenotypes of preeclampsia.  OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to develop prediction models for early-onset preeclampsia (EPE) and late-onset preeclampsia (LPE) respectively using clinical data, metabolome and proteome analyses on plasma samples and laboratory data. We retrospectively recruited 56 EPE, 50 LPE patients and 92 normotensive controls from three tertiary hospitals and used clinical and laboratory data in early pregnancy. Models for EPE and LPE were fitted with the use of patient' clinical, multi-omics and laboratory data. By comparing multi-omics and laboratory test variables between EPE, LPE and healthy controls, we identified sets of differentially expressed biomarkers, including 49 and 33 metabolites, 28 and 36 proteins as well as 5 and 7 laboratory variables associated with EPE and LPE respectively. Using the random forest algorithm, we developed a prediction model using seven clinical factors, seven metabolites, five laboratory test variables. The model yielded the highest accuracy for EPE prediction with good sensitivity (87.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.64%-97.34%) and specificity (94.1%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%). We also developed a prediction model that exhibited high accuracy in separating LPE from controls (sensitivity: 66.67%, 95% CI: 43.03%-85.41%; specificity: 94.12%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%) using seven clinical factors, five metabolites and eight proteins. Our study has identified a set of significant omics and laboratory features for PE prediction. The established models yielded high prediction performance for preeclampsia risk from clinical, multi-omics and laboratory information.",

Program faculty and staff curate and contribute relevant clinical and research news, resources, and events, including research opportunities, support groups, webinars, and in-person events. We exploratorily analyzed recipient data using Emma to describe patient engagement with monthly and standalone e-communications from September 2020 to April 2023, including open rates (number opened/number successful deliveries) and click-to-open rates (number clicks/number opened). An average of 3915 young patients were emailed monthly e-communications (range 3202-4380). The open rate steadily increased from 19.3 to 53.0% over 31 months. The topics with the highest click rate were content related to virtual or in-person peer- and social work-led support meetings (15%), healthy lifestyle and integrative therapy (15%), DFCI-organized conferences/series (13%), and managing the details of life (10%). One topic of interest was that of fertility and childrearing, comprising almost 50% of all clicks between March 2021 and June 2021, and almost 20% between December 2022 and March 2023. Young patients with breast cancer engage heavily with programmatic e-communications focused on information about opportunities to interact with peers or experts, whether support meetings or informational events. This group appears eager for additional information on the unique lifestyle and reproductive challenges that they may face.",

  "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant public health challenge worldwide. This study examines the impact of screening history on the prognosis of cervical carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer among Taiwanese women. Data from the National Cervical Cancer Screening Registry and Taiwan Cancer Registry were analyzed, encompassing 13,552 cases of cervical carcinoma in situ and 6,853 cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed between 2009 and 2013. The study examined the relationship between screening history and five-year cumulative probability of death using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model, adjusting for factors like age, cancer stage, histological type, urbanization level, and treatment received. Screening history was an independent prognostic factor for both invasive cervical cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ, even after adjusting for key confounders. Compared to patients diagnosed within six months of a positive screening result, those diagnosed later or with a negative screening had higher post-diagnosis mortality (adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]: 1.42 [1.26-1.59] for invasive cervical cancer and 1.74 [0.52-5.83] for cervical carcinoma in situ), while never-screened patients had even higher mortality (1.61 [1.42-1.81] for invasive cervical cancer and 5.62 [1.29-24.51] for cervical carcinoma in situ). More advanced age at diagnosis, certain histological types, and living in less urbanized areas correlated with an increased risk of post-diagnosis death. Additionally, the absence of treatment post-diagnosis was significantly associated with worse outcomes. Screening history is a crucial independent prognostic factor for cervical carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer. Patients with a recent positive screening result have a markedly better prognosis than those diagnosed later, those with negative screenings, or unscreened individuals. This study emphasizes the importance of regular and timely cervical cancer screenings in improving prognosis and underscores the need to enhance awareness and accessibility of screening programs.",

  "abstract": "Uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma (UCEC) is a prevalent malignant tumor of the female reproductive system. Despite advancements in molecular biology and treatment strategies, the underlying molecular mechanisms of UCEC tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with UCEC pathogenesis, and to determine potential prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy targets for UCEC. RNA expression datasets and clinical data from UCEC patients were collected from the UCSC Xena database and The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Principal component analysis and LIMMA methods were employed to screen 177 UCEC tissues and 24 normal endometrial tissues. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that up-regulated DEGs were primarily involved in tissue development, cell cycle regulation, and epithelial development. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified DEGs in the blue modules that were significantly positively correlated with UCEC, while DEGs in the black modules were significantly negatively correlated with UCEC. Among the identified DEGs through WGCNA, 16 genes were selected, and further Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that 5 of these genes (AURKA, CCNE1, IQGAP3, TTK, and UBE2C) were significantly negatively correlated with overall survival (OS) and considered as hub genes. The expression of these hub genes was validated using GEO datasets and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis from the human protein atlas. Additionally, the calculation of immune scores for immune infiltration, immune cell infiltration, and immune cell regulation across the 5 hub genes revealed potential immunotherapeutic targets and strategies. This comprehensive investigation provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying UCEC development, identifies 5 promising prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy targets, and offers guidance for UCEC treatment approaches.",

  "abstract": "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Identifying predictors of length of hospital stay (LOS) in PROM patients can aid in improving management and prognosis. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was searched to acquire data on PROM individuals. A univariable analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) were adopted to identify factors closely related to LOS. Next, the change trends in the key variable over multiple time points were determined using a latent class trajectory model (LCTM). The association of these trajectories with LOS was analyzed using GLMs. The retrospective study finally enrolled 868 samples. The significant factors included initial hemoglobin, chorioamnionitis, premature birth, and rupture to delivery interval <24 h. Notably, higher initial hemoglobin level was independently associated with shorter LOS (β = -0.599; 95% CI = [-0.846, -0.352]; p < 0.05). The stratified analysis confirmed this association in all subgroups except those with chorioamnionitis. The LCTM identified three hemoglobin trajectories. Compared to other trajectory groups, the \"lowest, declining\" group had longer LOS (p < 0.05). PROM patients with lower initial hemoglobin levels and the \"lowest, declining\" trajectory group were linked to longer LOS. Monitoring and managing hemoglobin levels is important in improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease defined by endometrial-like tissue (lesions) outside the uterine lining. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, and 9 million women in the US, during reproductive years. Endometriosis has varying clinical presentations; however, 90% of people with endometriosis report pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and 26% report infertility. Risk factors for endometriosis include younger age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, lower body mass index, nulliparity, and congenital obstructive müllerian anomalies such as obstructed hemivagina. Although definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization of lesions, a suspected clinical diagnosis can be made based on symptoms, supported by physical examination findings and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; normal physical examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often delayed, averaging 5 to 12 years after onset of symptoms, with most women consulting 3 or more clinicians prior to diagnosis. Hormonal medications, such as combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only options, are first-line treatment and should be offered to symptomatic premenopausal women who do not currently desire pregnancy. In a network meta-analysis (n = 1680, 15 clinical trials), hormonal treatments including combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists led to clinically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, with mean differences ranging between 13.15 and 17.6 points (0-100 visual analog scale) with little difference in effectiveness among options. However, 11% to 19% of individuals with endometriosis have no pain reduction with hormonal medications and 25% to 34% experience recurrent pelvic pain within 12 months of discontinuing hormonal treatment. Surgical removal of lesions, usually with laparoscopy, should be considered if first-line hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Second-line hormone therapies include GnRH agonists and antagonists, and third-line treatments include aromatase inhibitors. Hysterectomy with surgical removal of lesions may be considered when initial treatments are ineffective. However, approximately 25% of patients who undergo hysterectomy for endometriosis experience recurrent pelvic pain and 10% undergo additional surgery, such as lysis of adhesions, to treat pain. Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. Hormonal suppression with combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins is first-line treatment for women who are not seeking immediate pregnancy. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be performed if hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and hysterectomy may be considered if medical treatments and surgical removal of lesions do not relieve symptoms.",

  "abstract": "The mechanism of the lipid paradox remains uncertain, and malnutrition may be 1 explanation. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the associations between baseline remnant cholesterol (RC) concentrations and clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke, stratified by nutritional status. Patients with ischemic stroke in a single-center prospective cohort (Shanghai, China) from January 2018 to December 2022 were studied. Individuals were classified into 3 groups based on their Controlling Nutritional Status score. Poor outcome and all-cause mortality during up to 3 months of follow-up were compared among patients with varied nutritional status and RC levels utilizing multivariate logistic regression analyses, RC splines, and subgroup analyses. A total of 6892 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the cohort, of which 5257 patients were included in the present study (without malnutrition: 2418 [46.0%]; mild malnutrition: 2516 [47.9%]; moderate-severe malnutrition: 323 [6.1%]). The median age was 69±12 years, and 3398 (64.6%) were male. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition had the highest risks of poor outcome (198 [61.3%];  <0.001) and all-cause mortality (106 [32.8%];  <0.001) during the 3-month follow-up. A higher baseline RC level was an independent protective factor for adverse outcomes in patients with any degree of malnutrition ( <0.05), which was not observed in patients without malnutrition. In addition, compared with the moderate-severely malnourished with RC <0.471 mmol/L, the adjusted odds ratios for poor outcome and all-cause mortality were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.450-1.438) and 0.898 (0.502-1.607) for participants with 0.471 to 0.632 mmol/L, 0.259 (0.095-0.704) and 0.222 (0.061-0.810) for 0.633 to 0.868 mmol/L, and 0.160 (0.037-0.689) and 0.202 (0.042-0.967) for ≥0.869 mmol/L, respectively. The lipid paradox was only observed in the malnourished patients with ischemic stroke. Strict lipid reduction therapy is still recommended for patients without malnutrition. However, when treating patients at any risk of malnutrition, the improvement of nutritional status may be more crucial.",

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of natural compounds in enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments. Baicalin, a bioactive compound from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits significant anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in modulating lung cancer cell behavior through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-mediated ferroptosis pathway. We employed cyber pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to predict and validate the interaction between baicalin and ALOX12. In vitro experiments were conducted on A549 lung cancer cells to assess the effects of baicalin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression levels of ALOX12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis markers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Baicalin treatment significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression in lung cancer cells, and this upregulation was associated with a reduction in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, baicalin-induced ferroptosis was characterized by increased ROS levels, iron accumulation, and elevated expression of GPX4 and ACSL4. These findings suggest that baicalin enhances ferroptosis through ALOX12 activation, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell growth. Baicalin significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression, promoted ferroptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 lung cancer cells. This finding provides evidence for the potential use of baicalin as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer and highlights the importance of ALOX12 in lung cancer treatment strategies.",

Patients were assigned to one of three anesthesia groups: intercostal nerve block (INB), pleural infiltration anesthesia (PIA), or local anesthesia (LA). The primary endpoints were perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse events within 30 days of MWA. Sixty patients (mean age 73.88 ± 6.44 years; 28 men) were included in the analysis. The PIA group had intraoperative VAS scores comparable to the INB group and significantly lower than the LA group (2.70 ± 1.34 vs. 2.85 ± 1.73 vs. 6.26 ± 1.41, respectively). Postoperatively, VAS scores at 2 h were significantly lower in the PIA and INB groups compared to the LA group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the PIA and INB groups (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.35 ± 1.63 vs. 2.25 ± 1.02).

  "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported that one of the major challenges for all countries in the next few years will be the development of preventive approaches to care for older adults. After COVID-19, multimodal interventions have been created to enhance older health, especially targeting respiratory muscles (e.g., inspiratory muscle training [IMT]). The following research aims to explore the combination of two interventions (IMT and Tai Chi) using a randomised, double-blind placebo approach. A total of 30 participants were recruited from the local community in Derby (UK) and underwent an experimental (IMT + Tai Chi) or placebo (sham-IMT + Tai Chi) training protocol. Measurements of balance (i.e., mini-BEST), inspiratory muscle strength (i.e., Maximal Inspiratory Pressure) and mobility (i.e., 6 Minutes Walking Test) were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks. The results show that a combination of IMT and Tai Chi significantly improves dynamic balance (P < 0.01) and mobility (P < 0.05) when compared to Tai Chi alone, with an additional positive correlation between balance, mobility and inspiratory muscle strength (P < 0.05). The manuscript is the first to report the combined effects of IMT and Tai Chi in older adults following rigorous methods. The results highlight the relationship between inspiratory muscle and balance, as the results demonstrate a potential link between metaboreflex and balance control, fostering multimodal practices for healthy ageing interventions.",

Regular exercise can prevent muscle loss, cognitive decline, and comorbidities, potentially reducing fall risk. Given the multifactorial nature of fall risk, a comprehensive assessment is required. To investigate the effects of a 40-week intervention, including a long-term exercise program (16-weeks), detraining (8-weeks), and retraining (16-weeks), on fall risk and cognitive status in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Participants (≥70 years old) were divided into two groups: Elastic Band Resistance Training (EBRT, n = 22) and a control group with no treatment (n = 20). Cognitive profile, body composition, muscle power, and multifactorial fall risk assessments (Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Fall Risk Assessment Tool (FRAT), and sensorimotor platform) were evaluated at four time points. Significant correlations between muscle power, fat-free mass, and cognitive status with fall risk assessments were observed at baseline. Both phases of the exercise intervention improved muscle power, body composition, cognitive profile, and fall risk status. The EBRT group showed significant improvements in muscle power (p ≤ 0.01), fall risk (FRAT, p ≤ 0.01), FES (p ≤ 0.05), sensorimotor performance (p ≤ 0.001), TUG (p ≤ 0.001), and cognitive status (MoCA, p ≤ 0.05). Protective effects persisted during the detraining phase. This study highlights significant improvements in fall risk assessment induced by EBRT, demonstrating its protective effects. The findings suggest that EBRT can enhance aspects related to fall risk, offering promising avenues for improving independence and quality of life in older adults prone to falls.",

Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: normal diet (ND), high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD + 30 mg/kg/day S9P (HFD + S9P). Fasting blood glucose (FBG), intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were conducted to assess blood glucose homeostasis. Morris Water Maze and Y maze tests evaluated cognitive function, and neuronal status was examined through pathological analysis, Golgi staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Colonic barrier integrity was assessed using periodic acid-Schiff and Alcian blue staining (AB-PAS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Intestinal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing, and serum metabolic characteristics were determined by metabolomics sequencing. S9P improved glucose homeostasis and alleviated cognitive decline in DACI mice. It also mitigated neuronal damage, dendritic degeneration, and synaptic damage, while restoring colonic barrier integrity and ameliorating gut microbiome imbalances, insulin resistance, and lipid imbalance. Additionally, S9P regulated metabolite profiles and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, and reduced astrocyte activation and neuroinflammatory responses in the hippocampus of HFD-induced DACI mice. S9P had a protective effect against HFD-induced diabetic cognitive impairment closely related to the modulation of the gut-brain axis, suggesting that S9P has the potential to become a new therapeutic approach for DACI.",

A total of 44 healthy middle-aged and elderly persons (47.1% women) aged over 40 were enrolled in this study. The digital cancellation test (DCT), the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), the Stroop colour-word test, and the trail making test (TMT) are, respectively, associated with four types of attention tasks: sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, and attention shifting. Functional near-infrared spectroscopic imaging was employed to measure the concentration of brain oxyhaemoglobin in the subjects, while they were performing these four attention tasks. In this study, we found distinct activation patterns in brain areas, such as BA-3, BA-4, BA-6, and others. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the frontal and right parietal lobes consistently showed higher density and strength of connections across tasks, with the PASAT task exhibiting the highest number of connections exceeding the threshold. Notably, the DCT task demonstrated significant correlations in oxygen fluctuations among several brain regions, while the TMT-B task highlighted strong functional connectivity within the bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. This research provides evidence that middle-aged and elderly people have different brain activation and functional connectivity patterns in different attentional tasks, suggesting individualized treatment for attention disorder patients based on impairment type and location.

  "abstract": "Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and care has shown benefits for frail older adults across various care settings. However, its integration into routine care within a surgical context remains limited. An ongoing randomised controlled multicentre study will evaluate the effects of a period of preoperative optimisation (up to eight weeks), involving interprofessional CGA and care, in addition to routine care before colorectal cancer resection surgery. If this approach proves favourable, it could potentially be incorporated into routine surgical care. To facilitate implementation, it is crucial to explore and understand participants' perceptions of taking part in a preoperative CGA and care intervention. To describe how frail older adults with colorectal cancer experience participation in a preoperative CGA and care intervention. This qualitative, descriptive study was part of a randomised controlled multi-centre study. In total, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with frail older adults undergoing a CGA and care intervention before colorectal cancer surgery. The data were analysed using inductive qualitative content analysis. Frail older adults with colorectal cancer experienced participation in preoperative CGA and care as an integral part of an intervention. They adopted an opportunity mindset when deciding to participate. Throughout the intervention, they observed the team working collaboratively and actively involving them in the optimisation process, enhancing their readiness for surgery by the end of the period. The findings indicated that frail older adults with colorectal cancer viewed the preoperative CGA and care intervention as a meaningful opportunity for improvement and a chance to extend life. Their active involvement and the collaborative efforts of the care team during the intervention were crucial in enhancing their understanding, manageability, and readiness for surgery. They valued the opportunity to make active choices when appropriate and appreciated having the right to delegate decisions to healthcare professionals. From a frail older adult's perspective, team-based approaches in preoperative care, such as CGA and care, offer benefits in terms of involvement and satisfaction. However, the thorough evaluation of postoperative outcomes remains necessary. OSF registry: https://osf.io/ch49n , registered on Sep 04, 2023.",

  "abstract": "Based on manual review of clinical notes of using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding, we evaluated the feasibility and validity for monitoring, recording, and reporting intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) events in patients with all-cause mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's dementia including, but not limited to, patients eligible for anti-amyloid therapy. Principal and first-position hospital discharge codes for ICH events for 200 patients were identified from the Veterans Affairs Health System structured administrative database. Clinician manual review of discharge summary notes assessed and confirmed the presence of coded events. Available documentation of bleed locations was further reviewed, and the extent of event adjudication for potential etiology was assessed. Additionally, 25 acute ICH cases were randomly identified by reviewing discharge notes to confirm corresponding diagnostic code-based reporting. Of the 200 identified patients, 161 with acute ICH events were confirmed, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80.5% for ICH event presence identified by diagnostic coding. Bleed locations were described for 151 of 161 patients with confirmed events. Of 110 cases whose diagnostic codes indicated an event location, 79 had location descriptions in discharge summaries that were consistent with the coding (PPV = 71.8%). Possible etiology was described in 56/161 patients' discharge summaries. Among the 25 acute ICH cases identified from discharge notes, 8 had corresponding ICH diagnostic codes. This study supports the feasibility and validity of the ICD-10 coding system for monitoring, recording, and reporting ICH event presence. When location is specified in the codes, the ICD-10 coding has an acceptable PPV. Overall, the current diagnostic coding system provides a reasonable framework for initial reporting and may allow for only limited inference of etiology such as differentiating nontraumatic versus traumatic events. Coding accuracy for ICH can be expected to further improve with the availability of guidelines, training, and standardization across clinical practices.",

  "abstract": "Geriatric patients with a hip fracture are at risk for adverse outcomes after surgery. A pilot study showed the feasibility of assessing of systemic inflammation in these patients through neutrophil analysis. The aim of this study was to correlate neutrophil categories to clinical outcomes in a larger cohort. In this prospective cohort study, blood samples were taken from geriatric patients with a hip fracture directly after trauma and healthy older people serving as controls. Neutrophil phenotypes were categorized (0-6 from no inflammation to severe inflammation) and correlated to clinical outcomes. In total, 289 patients (median age 82) and 45 age matched controls were included. Severe infections occurred in 8% of the patients and 9% died within 30 days. Patients displayed all neutrophil categories (0-6), while controls showed categories 0,1,3. A newly identified neutrophil category had higher leukocyte counts and CRP, with trends toward increased infections and mortality. Among patients receiving palliative care, 30-day mortality was 50% in categories 0-1 and 83% in higher categories. Neutrophil categories offer a feasible method to assess systemic inflammation and may assist in shared decision-making for palliative care. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that patients in category 0-1 are deemed fit for surgery, when other risk factors are absent. However, further research should investigate the quality-of-life of patients still alive after 30 days in order to determine whether immune profiling is of added clinical value in decision making regarding traumatic hip fractures in geriatric patients.",

A 43-year-old female with no prior history presented with right-sided otalgia, otorrhea, and hearing loss. At the time of presentation, patient was noted to have an erythematous tympanic membrane, which later developed into an pedunculated lesion on follow up. Imaging showed the lesion involved the Eustachian tube, middle ear and ossicular chain, and tympanic membrane and extended beyond the external auditory meatus. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry stains were negative for hemangiomas, nerve sheath neoplasms, myxoid sarcomas, and supported the final diagnosis of fibroepithelial polyp. The patient underwent surgical excision via a canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy including a facial recess approach with nointra-operative or post-operative complications. Throughout the workup of this case, three distinct pathologic diagnoses were reported for this tumor which highlights the shared pathologic characteristics among benign lesions of the temporal bone. However, all possible diagnoses were in keeping with the final diagnosis of fibroepithelial polyp. This case exhibits an unusually large and rare fibroepithelial polyp of the middle ear and temporal bone. This emphasizes the similarities of clinical and pathologic presentations of benign lesions of the middle ear and temporal bone and the importance of sending complete samples for pathologic diagnosis.",

A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L.

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of natural compounds in enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments. Baicalin, a bioactive compound from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits significant anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in modulating lung cancer cell behavior through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-mediated ferroptosis pathway. We employed cyber pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to predict and validate the interaction between baicalin and ALOX12. In vitro experiments were conducted on A549 lung cancer cells to assess the effects of baicalin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression levels of ALOX12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis markers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Baicalin treatment significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression in lung cancer cells, and this upregulation was associated with a reduction in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, baicalin-induced ferroptosis was characterized by increased ROS levels, iron accumulation, and elevated expression of GPX4 and ACSL4. These findings suggest that baicalin enhances ferroptosis through ALOX12 activation, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell growth. Baicalin significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression, promoted ferroptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 lung cancer cells. This finding provides evidence for the potential use of baicalin as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer and highlights the importance of ALOX12 in lung cancer treatment strategies.",

Patients were assigned to one of three anesthesia groups: intercostal nerve block (INB), pleural infiltration anesthesia (PIA), or local anesthesia (LA). The primary endpoints were perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse events within 30 days of MWA. Sixty patients (mean age 73.88 ± 6.44 years; 28 men) were included in the analysis. The PIA group had intraoperative VAS scores comparable to the INB group and significantly lower than the LA group (2.70 ± 1.34 vs. 2.85 ± 1.73 vs. 6.26 ± 1.41, respectively). Postoperatively, VAS scores at 2 h were significantly lower in the PIA and INB groups compared to the LA group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the PIA and INB groups (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.35 ± 1.63 vs. 2.25 ± 1.02).

Catheter-based therapies (CBT) are emerging technologies that provide reperfusion for patients with PE. However, the optimal timing of these interventions from initial presentation is unknown. This study aimed to determine whether the timing of CBT affects outcomes among patients with acute PE managed with CBT. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with PE who underwent CBT and were included in the Nationwide Readmissions Database between January 2017 and December 2020. Patients who underwent early CBT (≤1 day from admission) were compared with those who underwent delayed CBT (>1 day). The primary outcome was death at 90 days, and secondary outcomes included 90-day readmissions. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression, and propensity score weighting (PSW) was utilised to compare outcomes between early and delayed CBT. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate the risk of primary and readmission outcomes. A total of 12,137 patients were included: 1,992 (16.4%) had high-risk PE, and 1,856 (15.3%) were treated with delayed CBT. After PSW, early CBT was associated with a lower risk of 90-day death in both intermediate-risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.66) and high-risk (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99) PE.

Although previous studies have established nomograms for lung adenocarcinoma, these nomograms do not effectively predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients with bone metastasis. This study aims to establish and validate a new nomogram to solve this problem. Data were collected from the SEER database and from patients at our hospital who had been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and developed bone metastases. The patients were randomly assigned into the training and internal validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. External validation was conducted using an independent patient cohort from two hospitals. Different methods were used to evaluate the nomogram's performance. The relationship between different metastatic sites and radiotherapy and chemotherapy was also analyzed to evaluate patient prognosis. The following factors were identified as significant prognostic indicators: age, sex, marital status, T stage, N stage, tumor grade, tumor size, presence of brain and liver metastases, and receipt of chemotherapy. The nomogram's concordance indices for predicting overall survival were consistently above 0.7, and the area under the curve values, calibration plots, and decision curves all confirmed the nomogram's strong predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analysis revealed that chemotherapy was the most effective treatment modality. This study developed a nomogram that can predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients with bone metastasis. The results showed that patients with liver metastasis had the worst prognosis and that chemotherapy was the most effective treatment regimen for patients with different metastatic sites.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Head lice is a common condition in school-age children caused by Pediculus humanus capitis. Although typically associated with scalp itching and discomfort, chronic or severe infestations can occasionally lead to more severe health consequences. This report describes a 12-year-old boy from Missouri, USA, presenting with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and a severe head lice infestation. IDA is characterized by insufficient iron to meet the body's needs, typically due to blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption. While there is no established causative relationship between head lice and IDA, several case reports have suggested a co-occurrence, often in the absence of other identifiable causes. This raises the possibility that significant lice burden may contribute to or exacerbate IDA, particularly through blood loss from lice feeding on the host's scalp. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with fatigue, pallor, and weakness. Initial outpatient laboratory test data revealed a hemoglobin of 3.4 g/dL, necessitating urgent transportation to the emergency department (ED). Upon examination in the ED, a severe Pediculus humanus capitis infestation was incidentally discovered. Despite extensive inpatient workup, no other source of anemia was identified. The patient was treated with blood transfusions and topical pediculicides to address his anemia and head lice, respectively. Remarkably, his anemia and symptoms resolved without recurrence following these interventions. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged pediculosis capitis with high lice burden should be considered as a potential etiologic factor in patients with unexplained IDA and a negative anemia workup. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms linking these 2 conditions.",

  "abstract": "To evaluate thoraco-laparoscopic McKeown esophagectomy (TLME) versus endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for clinical-T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) depending on invasion depth. Early-stage ESCC has been widely treated by endoscopic resection. While ESD is safer than esophagectomy perioperatively, its survival benefits for clinical-T1N0M0 ESCC, especially high-risk T1b tumors, are unclear. A retrospective study was conducted on clinical-T1N0 ESCC patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University comparing TLME (cT1a, n = 352; cT1b, n = 205) with ESD (cT1a, n = 499; cT1b, n = 62). Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) were analyzed depending on invasion depth after propensity score matching to account for selection bias. ESD group had better OS (hazard ratio: 0.54, p = 0.029) but worse RFS (hazard ratio: 6.83, p < 0.001) than TLME group in general terms. T1a cancers showed no difference in DSS and MFS between groups. T1b subgroup with ESD had lower DSS (hazard ratio: 5.65, p = 0.036) and MFS (hazard ratio: 3.54, p = 0.069). R1-resection in ESD group linked to poorer OS (hazard ratio: 5.89, p = 0.006) and DSS (hazard ratio: 3.67, p = 0.006). ESD can be safe in the treatment of clinical-T1aN0 ESCC. However, concerning oncologic curability, TLME should be recommended for patients with clinical-T1bN0 ESCC in terms of favorable DSS, RFS, and MFS.",

U937, THP-1, HL60 and K562 cells were cultured  . The cells in logarithmic growth phase (l×10   cells/well) were added with  F-FDG, and the uptake rate of  F-FDG was measured at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after addation, respectively. The four kinds of cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the hind limbs of nude mice to establish a tumor-bearing nude mouse model. When the tumor size was about 500 mm ,  F-FDG was injected through the tail vein of the mice, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed at 60 min after injection. The morphology of tumor-bearing cells was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining in serial pathological sections. After co-incubation with  F-FDG, the  F-FDG uptake rates of U937 cells were significantly higher than THP-1, HL60 and K562 cells at 4 time points (all   <0.05), and THP-1 cells were higher than K562 cells (all   <0.05). The uptake rate of  F-FDG by leukemia cells was rapid in the first 60 min, then tended to be stable. Pathological analysis showed that subcutaneous inoculation of U937, THP-1, HL60 and K562 cells could successfully establish tumor-bearing nude mouse models of myeloid leukemia. The  F-FDG uptake value in U937 tumor-bearing nude mice was significantly higher than THP-1, HL60 and K562 tumor-bearing nude mice (all   <0.01). The  F-FDG uptake values in THP-1 and HL60 tumor-bearing nude mice were significantly higher than that in K562 tumor-bearing nude mice (both   <0.01). The tumor-bearing nude mouse model of myeloid leukemia can be successfully constructed by subcutaneous inoculation. The  F-FDG uptake rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is higher in cells cultured in vitro and tumor-bearing nude mouse model.  F-FDG may have better clinical application value for AML.

F-FDG与不同类型髓系白血病细胞共同孵育后，U937细胞在4个时间点的摄取率均明显高于THP-1、HL60、K562细胞（均   <0.05）；THP-1细胞在4个时间点的摄取率均高于K562细胞（均   <0.05）；前60 min内白血病细胞对 F-FDG的摄取速度较快，60 min之后摄取速度趋于稳定。成功构建了U937、THP-1、HL60、K562白血病细胞荷瘤裸鼠模型，U937荷瘤裸鼠对 F-FDG摄取值均明显高于THP-1、HL60、K562荷瘤裸鼠（均   <0.01）；THP-1和HL60荷瘤裸鼠对 F-FDG摄取值明显高于K562荷瘤裸鼠（均   <0.01）。. 通过皮下接种法成功构建髓系白血病荷瘤裸鼠模型，在体外培养的细胞和荷瘤裸鼠模型中，急性髓系白血病细胞对 F-FDG摄取率较高， F-FDG可能对急性髓系白血病具有更好的临床应用价值。.",

  "abstract": "To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic responses and prognostic features of   fusion gene for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L. The main immunophenotype was common-B ALL (44 cases, 91.7%). Other leukemia fusion genes such as   and   were not observed in this cohort of patients. All patients received the treatment of NPCLC-ALL2008 protocol, and 5 cases (10.4%) occurred poor prednisone response. All the 48 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction treatments. The last follow-up date was April 30, 2023. A total of 5 children relapsed, including 1 case with intermediate risk and 4 cases with high risk. The recurrence rate in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the intermediate- and low-risk groups (both   < 0.05). Most relapsed children had elevated WBC counts at initial diagnosis. Among them, WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was observed in 4 cases. The recurrence rate among children with WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was significantly higher than that with WBC counts <100×10 /L (  < 0.01). Four deaths occurred in this cohort, of which 3 died of leukemia recurrence. The 10-year event-free survival rate and 10-year overall survival rate of the 48 children with positive   fusion gene were 87.5%±4.8% and 91.7%±4.0%, respectively. In ALL children with positive   fusion gene, those with elevated WBC counts and high risk stratification at initial diagnosis are more likely to experience recurrence. Recurrence is the main cause of death in this group. It is suggested that such kind of children receive more intensive chemotherapy or undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as early as possible to further improve prognosis.  融合基因阳性儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病临床特点及预后分析. 探讨儿童   融合基因阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的临床特点、治疗反应及预后特征。. 回顾性分析2010年7月至2017年11月于本院初诊的ALL患儿837例，实时荧光定量PCR技术检测出   阳性患儿48例，收集其临床资料进行分析。. 48例   融合基因阳性患儿中男26例，女22例，发病年龄9个月-13岁。初诊低危、中危及高危分别为2例（4.2%）、32例（66.7%）和14例（29.1%）。初诊外周血白细胞数<50×10 /L者25例（53.2%），(50-100)×10 /L者11例（23.4%），≥100×10 /L者11例（23.4%）。免疫表型主要是以common-B ALL为主（44例，占91.7%）。48例   阳性患儿未检测到  等其他白血病融合基因。所有患儿均接受中国儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病2008方案治疗，其中，泼尼松反应不良者5例（10.4%）。48例患儿在诱导治疗结束后均获得完全缓解。至随访截止时间（2023年4月30日），共5例患儿出现复发，其中中危1例、高危4例，高危组患儿的复发率明显高于中、低危组（均  < 0.05）；绝大多数复发患儿初诊白细胞数较高，其中4例≥100×10 /L，初诊白细胞数≥100×10 /L组患儿的复发率明显高于<100×10 /L组（  < 0.01）。本组共有4例患儿死亡，其中因白血病复发导致死亡的患儿有3例。48例   融合基因阳性患儿10年无事件生存率及10年总生存率分别为87.5%±4.8%、91.7%±4.0%。. 在   融合基因阳性ALL患儿中，初诊白细胞计数高及危险度分层较高的患儿更容易出现复发，复发是患儿的主要死亡原因，建议此类患儿接受更高强度的化疗或尽早进行造血干细胞移植以进一步改善其预后。.",

The aim of our research was to find out reliable landmarks for the surgical access of the facial nerve trunk (FNT). Our study was conducted on 75 hemifaces of adult embalmed cadavers. Prior to anatomical dissection, the cephalometric type of each head was determined and the landmarks identified for study have been established. For the FNT surgical access, 8 landmarks were measured and statistically analyzed on 5 criteria: gender, laterality, cephalometric type, branching pattern and its variant (classic/atypical). Six of the examined landmarks showed statistical significance depending on gender (p ≤ 0.05) among which were: angle of the FNT bifurcation (FNTB); distance between the FNT division and the angle of the mandible (FNTD/AM); distance between the FNT division and the apex of the mastoid process (FNTD/AMP); distance between the FNT origin and the intertragic notch (FNTO/ITN); distance between the FNT origin and the triangular prominence of the cartilage of the external acoustic meatus (FNTO/∆CEAM); distance between the FNT origin and the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle insertion point (FNTO/AMSCMIP). The angle formed at the intersection of the facial nerve trunk with the vertical line drawn through the anterior margin of the external acoustic meatus (FNT/VEAM), was statistically significant depending on laterality (p = 0.049). The FNT bifurcation angle was also statistically significant depending on the branching pattern (p = 0.005). Although seven of the studied landmarks were statistically significant based on at least one of the examined criteria, the limitations of the research include: a small number of samples, predominance of the male hemifaces, and prevalence of the mesocephalic type individuals.",

  "abstract": "Exposure to air pollution and meteorological conditions, such as humidity, has been linked to adverse respiratory health outcomes in children. This study aims to develop predictive models for pediatric hospitalizations based on both environmental exposures and clinical features. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2500 children (aged 1-18) who presented with respiratory symptoms at the emergency department, during 2016-2017. Air pollution data, including NOx and NO  concentrations, and relative humidity (RH) were collected from nine monitoring stations and were cross-referenced with the children's residential locations to assess their specific exposure level. Statistical tests, including Chi-square and Wilcoxon tests, were used to analyze the data. Machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were developed to predict the children's hospitalizations. Boys were more likely to be hospitalized than girls (60.6% vs. 39.4%, p = 4.31e-06). Hospital visits peaked during winter (p = 3.56e-37). Increased emergency room visits were statistically significantly associated with highly polluted days (p = 0.038). Hospitalized children were exposed to lower RH (median 64.9%) compared to nonhospitalized children (median 69.4%, p = 0.005). The RF and XGBoost models were reliable, with accuracy rates of 0.7-0.98, Precision scores of 0.88-0.99, and AUC scores of 81%-99%. Key features included temperature, NOx levels, RH, and exposure to SO . This study investigates the effects of air pollution and humidity on pediatric respiratory health. The models developed offer valuable tools for predicting hospitalizations and are intended to support public health planning and resource allocation.",

All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

  "abstract": "Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Catheter-based therapies (CBT) are emerging technologies that provide reperfusion for patients with PE. However, the optimal timing of these interventions from initial presentation is unknown. This study aimed to determine whether the timing of CBT affects outcomes among patients with acute PE managed with CBT. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with PE who underwent CBT and were included in the Nationwide Readmissions Database between January 2017 and December 2020. Patients who underwent early CBT (≤1 day from admission) were compared with those who underwent delayed CBT (>1 day). The primary outcome was death at 90 days, and secondary outcomes included 90-day readmissions. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression, and propensity score weighting (PSW) was utilised to compare outcomes between early and delayed CBT. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate the risk of primary and readmission outcomes. A total of 12,137 patients were included: 1,992 (16.4%) had high-risk PE, and 1,856 (15.3%) were treated with delayed CBT. After PSW, early CBT was associated with a lower risk of 90-day death in both intermediate-risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.66) and high-risk (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99) PE. Early CBT was associated with lower rates of all-cause readmission in patients with intermediate-risk PE (HR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95) and in those with high-risk PE (HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69-1.05). Among patients with intermediate- or high-risk PE, early CBT was associated with a lower risk of 90-day death and readmission. A further prospective study on the optimal timing for reperfusion using CBT is needed.",

  "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death globally in children aged 0-5 years. Early access to pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in low-resource, pre-hospital settings may result in improved pediatric pneumonia outcomes. However, few data exist regarding their application in such settings. We performed an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to examine use of pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in pre-hospital environments of Malawi. Our model yielded an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for pre-hospital pulse-oximetry use of $35 (USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared to no pulse-oximetry use. One-way sensitivity analysis showed highest sensitivity to the parameter of downstream hospitalization cost. Given that inpatient management is the standard of care for hypoxemic pneumonia, when only pre-hospital costs were considered the result was an ICER of $9.9/DALY averted. Both values were considered cost-effective according to a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold set for 1x the average GDP per capita in Malawi ($588, 2018). When oxygen was analyzed in combination with pulse-oximetry, we found a baseline WTP threshold for pre-hospital oxygen of $71 per patient. For every 1% reduction in total pediatric pneumonia mortality consequent to pre-hospital oxygen use, we determined the recommended WTP allowance for oxygen would increase by approximately $4.53. We conclude that pulse-oximetry is likely cost-effective in low-resource, pre-hospital environments. We acknowledge the need for further research on the effectiveness of pre-hospital oxygen in reducing pediatric pneumonia mortality and suggest ranges of cost and efficacy for which oxygen is likely to be found cost-effective in tandem with pulse-oximetry.",

A subgroup analysis of our prior Phase II trial showed that muscadine grape skin extract (MPX) increased PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients with SOD2 Ala/Ala variant which provided the rationale for this trial. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at 14 sites, evaluated patients with BCRPC and SOD2 Ala/Ala genotype. Patients received 4000 mg MPX or placebo daily. The primary endpoint was on-study PSA slope with comparisons between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints were PSADT, PSA response (≥ 50% decrease), and PSA progression free survival (PFS). Correlative studies included markers of oxidative stress and gastrointestinal microbiota composition. At interim analysis, fifty-nine patients were randomized (MPX, n = 29; placebo, n = 30). On-study PSA slopes at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks showed no significant differences between the MPX and placebo arms (p = 0.49). The study was stopped due to futility. No significant differences were observed in PSADT, PSA response, median PSA PFS, or oxidative stress biomarkers. MPX was well-tolerated, with no grade 3-4 AEs attributable to the study drug. Microbiome analysis showed no significant differences in alpha diversity but revealed increased relative abundance of Roseburia faecis and Akkermansia muciniphila in the MPX group. Although MPX supplementation had no significant effect on PSA slope in men with BCRPC and SOD2 Ala/Ala variant, this study provides a rigorous evaluation of a natural product and highlights the importance of well-designed clinical trials in advancing evidence-based integrative oncology.

Of 200 consecutively recruited children with a previously proven diagnosis of PBB 62 (12.2 years, female 48%) were interviewed after 7.7 (5.4-14.7) years about their previous and current symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs: spirometry, body plethysmography, nitrogen multi-breath washout, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide) were performed. Children with persistent symptoms were offered lung imaging. 11 (17.7%) patients suffered from chronic or recurring wet cough years after their first PBB episode. 15 (24.19%) had at least one abnormal spirometry parameter. FEV1 was abnormal in eight of 62 (12.9%), LCI 2.5% in seven of 56 (12.5%), FVC in 12 of 62 (19.35%) and FEV1/FVC in five of 62 (8.06%) cases. PFT did not differ between children with and without wet cough. Lung MRI/CT demonstrate in four of nine cases abnormalities of the bronchial walls, including one with incipient bronchiectasis. After PBB in early childhood, a significant proportion of children suffer from respiratory symptoms many years later, some have an objectively reduced lung function and structural changes of the bronchial wall despite adequate initial therapy. Wet cough alone seems not to be a sensitive clinical predictor. Due to the retrospective study design, we cannot proof any causal relationship. However, to detect late bronchopulmonary sequelae, continuous follow-up of these children should become mandatory.",

  "abstract": "Chemotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) has not achieved the desired outcome due to inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and limited tumor-specific drug accumulation. Strategies that employ bioinspired nanoparticles to enhance targeted drug accumulation can help improve therapeutic efficacy. In this work, a novel nanoparticle, PCM@TMA-lip, exhibiting hybrid-targeting capabilities, is presented, with an engineered cell membrane coated on a lipid core. The membrane modified with a biologically derived peptide enables PCM@TMA-lip to evade immune clearance and enable precise tumor targeting. The lipid core with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-conjugated Temozolomide (TMZ) enhances FABP7-mediated uptake, promotes lysosomal escape via lipid peroxidation, and reduces tumor migration and drug resistance. In vitro, PCM@TMA-lip inhibited tumor cell malignancy and suppressed the growth of 3D spheroids. In vivo, it suppressed tumor progression, reduced Ki67  proliferation, increased TUNEL  apoptosis, and prolonged survival in GBM-bearing mice, highlighting its potential as an effective strategy to improve GBM chemotherapy.",

  "abstract": "Long-term neurodevelopment of moderate and late preterm infants (MLPTI; gestational age [GA] 32 0/7 weeks to 36 6/7 weeks) is at a lower level than that of those at term age. Increased protein and energy intakes in the first week of life have been associated with better neurodevelopment early in life, in very preterm infants. This study aimed to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome of MLPTI at 2 years corrected age (CA) for prematurity (i.e., after term equivalent age) and its association with nutritional intake in the first week of life. We prospectively collected nutritional data during the first week of life from 100 MLPTI (GA 32 0/7 weeks to 35 6/7 weeks). At 2 years CA, children underwent a neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third edition, Dutch version (BSID-III-NL). The mean BSID-III-NL (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) score was 103.1 (10.9) on the cognitive composite, 101.1 (SD ± 15.0) on the language composite, and 100.8 (SD ± 9.6) on the motor composite. Boys scored significantly lower than girls on both cognitive and language composite scores. We found no significant associations between nutritional intake in the first week of life and neurodevelopment at 2 years CA. Neurodevelopment at 2 years CA was within normal limits, while boys scored lower than girls. First week nutritional intakes do not seem to be associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years CA. This study emphasizes the need for more long-term follow-up and research concerning neurodevelopment in MLPTI, especially in boys.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Head lice is a common condition in school-age children caused by Pediculus humanus capitis. Although typically associated with scalp itching and discomfort, chronic or severe infestations can occasionally lead to more severe health consequences. This report describes a 12-year-old boy from Missouri, USA, presenting with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and a severe head lice infestation. IDA is characterized by insufficient iron to meet the body's needs, typically due to blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption. While there is no established causative relationship between head lice and IDA, several case reports have suggested a co-occurrence, often in the absence of other identifiable causes. This raises the possibility that significant lice burden may contribute to or exacerbate IDA, particularly through blood loss from lice feeding on the host's scalp. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with fatigue, pallor, and weakness. Initial outpatient laboratory test data revealed a hemoglobin of 3.4 g/dL, necessitating urgent transportation to the emergency department (ED). Upon examination in the ED, a severe Pediculus humanus capitis infestation was incidentally discovered. Despite extensive inpatient workup, no other source of anemia was identified. The patient was treated with blood transfusions and topical pediculicides to address his anemia and head lice, respectively. Remarkably, his anemia and symptoms resolved without recurrence following these interventions. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged pediculosis capitis with high lice burden should be considered as a potential etiologic factor in patients with unexplained IDA and a negative anemia workup. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms linking these 2 conditions.",

A modified MeDiC scoring system was applied in 8955 subjects with localized (T1-T4N0M0) or metastasized disease as per the Bladder Cancer Data Base Sweden (BladderBaSe) 2.0. Association between MeDiC score and not being discussed at MDTM was investigated by multivariable logistic regression, and further explored in relation to calendar time period, healthcare region, age at diagnosis and hospital volume. Median total MeDiC score was lower in individuals not being discussed at an MDTM (7.0 Inter Quartile Range [IQR] 6.0-9.0) compared to those who were (8.0 IQR 6.0-10.0). Adjusted odds ratio for not being discussed at an MDTM was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-2.4) for a MeDiC score in the lower quartile, as compared to the highest quartile, with higher estimates when performing stratified analyses in later calendar years and in specific healthcare regions. Our data indicate that the MeDiC score is applicable in bladder cancer patients, and we identified an association between lower MeDiC score and not being discussed at an MDTM.",

  "abstract": "The effect of exercise on homocysteine (Hcy) levels is multifaceted and varies significantly across different populations. This review investigates how various exercise modalities-moderate to vigorous physical activity, acute intense exercise, aerobic exercise, and resistance training-affect Hcy concentrations, alongside the influence of demographic and health-related factors. Generally, moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with lower Hcy levels, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk. In contrast, acute high-intensity exercises may temporarily increase Hcy levels due to immediate metabolic responses and oxidative stress. The effects of exercise on Hcy levels are influenced by age, sex, baseline health status, nutritional intake, fitness level, exercise type, and genetic factors. Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular and neuroprotective outcomes but may not significantly affect Hcy levels in the long term. Conversely, resistance training demonstrates varied effects, with some studies indicating significant reductions in Hcy levels, particularly in specific populations like overweight older adults, while others show negligible changes. Overall, while evidence supports the beneficial role of regular physical activity in modulating Hcy levels, the relationship is complex and affected by multiple factors. Further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms and optimize exercise recommendations for different populations to control Hcy levels and associated health risks effectively.",

This multicenter retrospective study included 179 uHCC patients with Child-Pugh B (CP7 group: n = 106; CP8/9 group: n = 73), receiving a combination of lenvatinib/sorafenib/other TKIs and PD-1 inhibitors between December 2020 and March 2023. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were defined as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and safety. The median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 7.3 months (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 6.3-8.3) and 16.0 months (95% CI: 12.9-19.1), respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between CP7 and CP8/9 groups in PFS (7.8 vs. 6.3 months, p = 0.28), OS (17.8 vs. 14.0 months, p = 0.20), ORR (33.0% vs. 27.4%, p = 0.42), or safety profiles.

  "abstract": "Digital health technology (DHT)-based psychological interventions are emerging as a means to enhance psychological outcomes for cancer survivors. This study aims to assess the effects of DHT-based psychological interventions on anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life among cancer survivors. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool RoB 2 was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to check if the interventions reviewed were described in detail to be implemented in the clinical setting. Data synthesis was conducted in Review Manager (Version 5.4), and the effect size was calculated by the standardized mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. The certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. This meta-analysis encompassed 46 randomized controlled trials, involving 5211 participants. DHT-based psychological interventions significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.59/-0.24), depression (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.39/-0.13), sleep disturbance (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI -0.64/-0.14), fatigue (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI -0.77/-0.17), and improved quality of life (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI 0.22/0.62). Subgroup analysis indicated that interventions lasting for a duration of ≥ 12 weeks, and integrated interventions might be the most effective in addressing adverse psychological outcomes. And cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions demonstrated significant effectiveness in managing sleep disturbance. DHT-based psychological interventions might be effective for improving anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life in cancer survivors. We cannot draw definitive conclusions due to intervention and study design heterogeneity. Further rigorous trials are crucial to identify optimal interventions for different types of cancers, determine suitable durations, specify types of DHT-based psychological interventions and validate intervention therapies.",

A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify the relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Nine RCTs involving 1,157 patients were included. For primary efficacy, rituximab had a lower relapse rate than azathioprine (AZA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (odds ratio (OR): 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.84 and OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08-0.68, respectively). Based on the result of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), rituximab had the highest probability of reducing relapse (SUCRA = 86.6%), followed by cyclophosphamide (CYC), belimumab + AZA, methotrexate (MTX), AZA, and MMF. Regarding major relapse, rituximab also showed the highest probability (SUCRA = 93.6%). Concerning safety, there were no significant differences in the incidence of SAEs and serious infection among the different medicines. According to the SUCRA, MMF had the lowest probability of SAEs and serious infection. In conclusion, rituximab may be a treatment method for effectively reducing relapses in AAV patients during maintenance therapy among the medicines investigated.

Days of app use were correlated with reported patient-reported outcomes of interest, ease of use, the utility of features, and importance of features. Of 293 enrolled participants, 284 remained active in the study, and 206 (72.5%) completed the 24-week MARS survey. App Interest was positively correlated with app use (p = 0.01) and self-reported days of app use (p = 0.0008). Perceived ease of use trended toward significance with greater app use (p = 0.06). Most individuals (72.0%, 144/200) agreed the app helped them remember to take hydroxyurea, with trends toward higher days of app use (p = 0.07). Those who used the app more agreed they would continue to use it after the study (p = 0.04). Most individuals (54.3%) reported that reminders to take their hydroxyurea were the most important app feature. In this study, positive perceptions toward the application features influenced app use and intention to continue using the application.

Since the behavior of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) is potentially affected by plasma-derived exosomes, this study aimed to investigate whether the plasma-derived exosome of young and elderly human donors can deliver \"youth\" or \"aging\" signals into human umbilical cord blood-derived HSCs in vitro. Exosomes were isolated from four young (Y-exo) and four old (O-exo) donors. Umbilical cord blood-derived HSCs were exposed to two concentrations of exosomes (5 and 10 μg/mL). Then, lineage differentiation (CD41 and CD38), the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1β and IL- 6, and NFκB activity were evaluated using flow cytometry, qRT-PCR Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) methods, and western blot techniques, respectively. The lineage-specific markers CD41 and CD38 expression were increased after exposure to O-exo compared to Y-exo at the concentration of 10 μg/mL (P<0.001). The HSCs treated with 10 μg/mL O-exo increased protein and mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-6 compared to Y-exo at 10 μg/mL concentration (P<0.01). Furthermore, a significant difference was seen in p-NF-κB levels between O-exo and Y-exo at the concentration of 10 μg/mL (P=0.0014). Our findings advocated the concept that circulating exosomes of old and young individuals may differently affect the pathways involved in the aging process in HSCs.Therefore, exosomes may be applied as therapeutic agents for regenerative medicine.",

  "abstract": "Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) have become the current standard in the growth-friendly treatment of patients with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). MCGRs allow noninvasive lengthenings with external lengthening device and reduce the need for surgical procedures. The association of preoperative body mass index (BMI) and the outcomes of the MCGR treatment is not well known. Prospectively collected international database was reviewed for EOS patients treated with MCGR. Patients without preoperative BMI data or follow-up <2 years were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy weight, overweight, and underweight using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Quality of life was assessed using EOSQ-24. Results were analyzed from the 2-year follow-up. A total of 663 patients were categorized into underweight (n=91), healthy weight (n=417), and overweight (n=155) groups. There were no significant differences in major curve correction or thoracic height increase among the BMI groups, irrespective of etiology. Distribution of BMI categories differed significantly by etiology (P=0.009), with lower healthy weight proportions in the syndromic group (92/167, 55%) compared with idiopathic (131/177, 74%) (adjusted P=0.004), and a higher underweight proportion in neuromuscular (36/244, 15%) compared with idiopathic (15/177, 8.5%) (adjusted P=0.044). Higher BMI z-scores were associated with an increased incidence of complications, including implant-related complications (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3) and implant breakage (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Healthy weight and underweight patients experienced lower overall complication rates compared with overweight patients. Implant-related complications were less common in underweight patients compared with overweight patients (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.90). Higher BMI z-score was a significant predictor of implant breakage, whereas preoperative major curve, kyphosis, and etiology were not. EOSQ-24 scores did not differ significantly among BMI groups, and changes in scores were comparable across groups during follow-up. BMI status did not influence curve correction, thoracic height increase, or EOSQ-24 outcomes in early-onset scoliosis patients. However, the higher incidence of implant breakage in overweight patients suggests that elevated BMI should be carefully considered when planning treatment. Level III.",

  "abstract": "Eliciting ferroptotic cell death in tumors has enhanced prospects for cancer therapy because of its proinflammatory properties, which enable damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release and immune response activation. However, the immunogenicity of ferroptosis and how to controllably activate the self-enhanced antitumor immune response by cellular ferroptosis require further investigation. In this study, a piezoelectric BaTiO -based ferroptosis inducer (BTO@Fe) is synthesized for effective cancer immunotherapy. BTO@Fe induces moderate ferroptosis by introducing excess iron and catalyzing the Fenton reaction. When subjected to ultrasound (US) irradiation, the piezoelectrically excited electrons and holes are separated, further catalyzing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) consumption and consequently causing intensified ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). Moreover, activated CD8  T cells respond to immune signals by releasing interferon gamma (IFNγ), which sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis in an intrinsic mechanism of ferroptosis initiation. The robust ferroptosis originating from exogenous piezocatalytic reactions and the endogenous immune responses demonstrates satisfactory in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. This work suggests that doping-engineered piezoelectric materials with augmented catalytic activity are promising countermeasures for restoring immunogenicity in ferroptotic cells.",

This study examines differences in sex and age related TBI epidemiology in a high-volume trauma centre intensive care unit (ICU) cohort, aiming to identify potential targets for prevention. This retrospective, single centre study includes all consecutive TBI patients admitted to the ICU in a 4-year study period. Patient demographics, comorbidities, co-medication, trauma setting and associated risk behaviour were compared between sexes and age groups (over/under 65 years). 592 patients (73.3% male, 26.7% female) were included. The leading cause of TBI was falls (52.4%), followed by road traffic accidents (RTA) (35.8%). Overall, men were more likely to suffer from a road traffic accident, while women were more likely to suffer a low energy fall. No differences in injury severity and comorbidities between sexes were observed. Young patients most likely suffered from a RTA while older patients from a low energy fall irrespective of sex. Both sexes portrayed risk associated behaviors with higher rates of alcohol intoxication in males, while females were less likely to wear a helmet in two-wheeled RTAs. We conclude that sex- and age-related epidemiologic differences in TBI exist. Our results suggest that sex and age-specific prevention measures might be advisable for optimal mitigation of TBI and its sequelae.",

  "abstract": "The VINCat program, established in Catalonia, Spain, in 2006, is a comprehensive infection prevention program for healthcare-associated infections. This study aims to analyze long-term trends in periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) following primary hip and knee arthroplasties over 15-year period (2008-2022). PJI was defined according to CDC-NHSN criteria and updated in 2016 to incorporate the Musculoskeletal Infection Society classification. Data on PJI following total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and hip hemiarthroplasty (HHA) were prospectively collected and analyzed across three periods: 2008-2012, 2013-2017, and 2018-2022. Sixty-seven hospitals participated in the surveillance, reporting 189,063 procedures, including 61,267 THA (median age: 69 years, 47% female), 115,940 TKA (median age: 73 years, 68% female), and 11,856 HHA (median age: 86 years, 73% females). PJI incidence rates for THA were 0.9%, 1.1%, and 1.2% across the three periods (odds ratio (OR):1.14, 95% CI: 0.96-1.35). For TKA, rates were 0.9%, 1.0%, and 0.9% (OR:0.95, 95% CI: 0.83-1.09). The incidence of HHA-PJI declined from 3.4% to 2.3% and 1.8% (OR:0.77, 95% CI:0.58-1.03). Overall, the most common etiology was coagulase negative staphylococci followed by Staphylococcus aureus. PJIs were diagnosed after hospital discharge in 87.1% of THA, 89.6% of TKA, and 73.9% of HHA. The incidence of PJI remains low despite an aging population undergoing orthopedic surgery, highlighting the effectiveness of current infection prevention strategies. A robust, long-term surveillance system is crucial for monitoring epidemiological trends and guiding the implementation of evidence-based preventive measures.",

  "abstract": "Traumatic hemipelvectomy (TH) is a rare and extremely severe injury of the pelvic area, which is often life-threatening and associated with a high mortality rate. Individual treatment is focused on the pelvic fracture and the type of accompanying injuries. The management of these severely injured patients places a considerable challenge on the resuscitation team. Patient management should be aggressive from the start. Current literature is focused predominantly on survivors, with only few case series providing possible treatment recommendations. Aggressive initial treatment is focused on standardized damage-control procedures during the prehospital, emergency room, and initial surgical phase to prevent exsanguination and contamination; a massive transfusion protocol should also be initiated immediately to address traumatic coagulopathy. Standard vascular treatment addresses the vascular injury. Colostomy is often recommended for adequate soft-tissue trauma management. Attempts at limb salvage often result in higher complications rates with non-functional limbs compared with completion of the TH. Thus, in cases of critical ischemia and identified relevant sacral nervous plexus injury during initial debridement in predominantly open injuries, primary completion of the hemipelvectomy is recommended.

  "abstract": "Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a rare disease characterized by narrowing of the upper airway and affects near-exclusively females. Patients often experience recurrent disease and require repeated surgical dilations. The pathophysiology underlying the broad spectrum of disease severity within iSGS remains unknown. In the current study, we sought to identify transcriptomic differences between iSGS patients with markedly different recurrence rates. Prospectively collected clinical and bulk RNA sequencing data from subglottic tissues of 56 female iSGS patients with 1-4 years of follow-up were analyzed. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis, comparing samples from the highest (1.19-1.87 dilations/year) versus the lowest (0.30-0.65 dilations/year) quartile of surgical dilation rate (i.e., high vs. low recurrence groups). In total, 220 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the high and low recurrence groups (adjusted p < 0.1 and log  fold change > |1|). Pathway enrichment analyses showed that the high recurrence group had significantly increased expression of genes involved in adaptive immune responses (e.g., immunoglobulin subunit genes) and extracellular matrix organization (e.g., COMP, NID2) (adjusted p < 0.1). In contrast, the low recurrence group had significantly increased expression of genes involved in cilia structure and function (e.g., CFAP43, DNAI2) (adjusted p < 0.1), suggesting a relatively increased abundance of respiratory cilia. Transcriptomic profiling suggests that lower recurrence rates in iSGS are associated with retention of respiratory cilia, while adaptive immune responses and increased extracellular matrix deposition are present in those with higher recurrence rates. These results hold promise for the development of prognostic markers and identification of therapeutic targets for iSGS.",

The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the current treatments of simple elbow dislocations to identify the best non-surgical and surgical management for patients with simple elbow dislocations (SED). A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar databases was performed using the following keywords: \"elbow dislocation\", \"simple elbow dislocation\", \"traumatic elbow dislocation\", \"treatment\", \"management\", \"reduction\", \"rehabilitation\", \"functional outcome\", \"range of motion\", \"complications\", \"recovery time\" over the years 1976-2024. The literature search and cross-referencing resulted in a total of 345 references, of which 283 were rejected due to off-topic abstract and/or failure to fulfil the inclusion criteria. After reading the remaining full-text articles, we included 60 studies, investigating non-surgical management or surgical management of simple elbow dislocations. The SMDA-SEC consensus panel provided recommendations to improve the management of patients with SED in clinical practice. Early mobilization is recommended for all cases of simple elbow dislocations. The CMA-EC panel was unable to advise or against the short-period (1-3-wk) immobilization, prolonged (3-wk) immobilization or operative treatment due to insufficient or conflicting evidence.",

  "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common male sexual dysfunction characterized by short ejaculatory latency with minimal stimulation, an inability to delay or control ejaculation, and distress or dissatisfaction due to the condition. Pharmacological therapy is central to PE management, with dapoxetine as the only approved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Off-label options, including long-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg, paroxetine), topical anesthetics, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil), and tramadol, have also been explored. Despite numerous systematic reviews on its treatment, challenges remain due to methodological heterogeneity, variability in outcome measures, and inconsistencies in trial quality, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. This umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SR-MAs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in prolonging intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and their safety by analyzing associated adverse events in adults with PE. A comprehensive search of SR-MAs ranging from 1990 to 2024 was performed. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed quality of previous SR-MAs using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews version 2 (AMSTAR-2) tool and the risk of bias of RCTs using Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. The primary outcome of interest was IELT. Effect sizes from primary studies of all SR-MAs were extracted, and after removing overlapping RCTs, a re-meta-analysis was conducted. We appraised evidence certainty using the Grading of recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations scoring system (GRADE). This review included 44 SR-MAs covering 65 RCTs. Only two SR-MAs rated as moderate to high quality in the AMSTAR-2 assessment. Additionally, only six out of 65 RCTs had a low risk of bias. The median follow-up for included RCTs was 7.9 months. These treatments significantly improved IELT compared to placebo, with paroxetine achieving the largest mean difference (5.64 min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.50 to 9.07). However, all pharmacological treatments were associated with adverse events, with paroxetine having the lowest risk (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.3 to 7.3), while risk ratios were higher for other treatments, including 4.1 for topical anesthetics, 2.4 for tramadol, and 1.8 for dapoxetine. Only topical anesthetics and paroxetine demonstrated a moderate to high rating in the GRADE assessment. Topical anesthetics, tramadol, and SSRIs significantly increase IELT. However, substantial heterogeneity among meta-analyses may limit the robustness of these findings. Future RCTs should include extended follow-up periods to better assess the long-term efficacy and safety of these treatments. CRD 42024561480.",

Current treatments primarily focus on physical therapy, medication, and surgery to alleviate symptoms associated with disc compression but do not address the progression of degeneration. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the potential of extracellular vesicle therapy as a novel preventive strategy to delay degeneration and enhance tissue repair in intervertebral discs. We cover the pathogenic mechanisms underlying intervertebral disc degeneration, including inflammation, apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy dysregulation, and the roles of non-coding RNAs. Subsequently, we discussed the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles and their molecular components, such as proteins, RNAs, and lipids, in modulating these pathways to counter intervertebral disc degeneration. We provides a comprehensive review of the significant role of extracellular vesicle cargo in mediating repair mechanisms. It discusses the functional enhancement advantages exhibited by extracellular vesicles under current bioengineering modifications and drug loading. The challenges and future prospects of utilizing extracellular vesicle therapy to treat this degenerative condition are also summarized.",

  "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of machine learning (ML) models in health sciences for outcome prediction and condition classification, their application in differentiating various types of auditory disorders remains limited. This study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the efficacy of five ML models in distinguishing (a) individuals with tinnitus from those without tinnitus and (b) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) from age-related hearing loss (ARHL). We used data from a cross-sectional study of the Canadian population, which included audiologic and demographic information from 928 adults aged 30 to 100 years, diagnosed with either ARHL or NIHL due to long-term occupational noise exposure. The ML models applied in this study were artificial neural networks (ANNs), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machines. The study revealed that tinnitus prevalence was over twice as high in the NIHL group compared with the ARHL group, with a frequency of 27.85% versus 8.85% in constant tinnitus and 18.55% versus 10.86% in intermittent tinnitus. In pattern recognition, significantly greater hearing loss was found at medium- and high-band frequencies in NIHL versus ARHL. In both NIHL and ARHL, individuals with tinnitus showed better pure-tone sensitivity than those without tinnitus. Among the ML models, ANN achieved the highest overall accuracy (70%), precision (60%), and F1-score (87%) for predicting tinnitus, with an area under the curve of 0.71. RF outperformed other models in differentiating NIHL from ARHL, with the highest precision (79% for NIHL, 85% for ARHL), recall (85% for NIHL), F1-score (81% for NIHL), and area under the curve (0.90). Our findings highlight the application of ML models, particularly ANN and RF, in advancing diagnostic precision for tinnitus and NIHL, potentially providing a framework for integrating ML techniques into clinical audiology for improved diagnostic precision.

  "abstract": "Full-thickness, transtendinous supraspinatus tears involve a significant portion of the remnant tendon that remains attached to the greater tuberosity footprint. This tear type often leaves insufficient medial tissue for tension-free footprint restoration with traditional repair techniques. In these clinical scenarios, side-to-side suture repair is an effective repair technique. Indications for this procedure include an acute mechanism of injury, sufficient remnant tendon left on the greater tuberosity, and a medial tear location such that primary repair of the medial tendon would not result in overtensioning of the repair. Following diagnostic arthroscopy, 2 suture tapes are passed through the medial and lateral portion of the tendon surface in a simple side-to-side fashion. Two FiberLink sutures (Arthrex) are then placed in luggage tag fashion, in between the side-to-side sutures within the myotendinous portion of the tear. The suture tapes are then tied in an arthroscopic fashion, completing the side-to-side repair. The looped sutures are then secured through a 4.75-mm BioComposite SwiveLock lateral row anchor (Arthrex) as an added reinforcement to prevent medial retraction of the myotendinous portion of the tear, creating a tension-free environment for optimal tear healing. Available literature suggests that the side-to-side repair technique in patients with transtendinous supraspinatus rotator cuff tears yields excellent outcomes equivalent to that of tendon-to-bone double-row suture anchor repair for conventional tendon to bone type tears. This surgical technique reduces risk of overtensioning the repair and optimizes the healing environment in this rare clinical scenario. Side-to-side suture repair for full-thickness transtendinous supraspinatus tears is an effective treatment for patients with this uncommon presentation. When healthy tendon is present, a robust repair can be achieved with excellent outcomes and low rates of surgical complications.

  "abstract": "Early identification of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children is important to prevent chronic symptoms and long-term negative consequences. However, PTSD often goes unrecognized in the emergency setting of hospitals and screening methods for young children are lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of an early screening tool for PTSD in a sample of young children (0-7 years) after unintentional injury. The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale - Early Screener (PEDS-ES) was administered to parents of children referred to the Emergency Department within 7 days post-accident (  = 82), and a validated interview for PTSD was administered 3 months after the accident as criterion measure: the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA). Diagnostic accuracy of the PEDS-ES was inspected using area under the curve analyses including sensitivity, specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Value. After three months PTSD diagnosis was established in 21% of the children. Use of the PEDS-ES within 7 days after the injury showed fair accuracy with AUC = .727. Sensitivity (0.65) and specificity (0.73) for the suggested cutoff of 8 were moderate for predicting PTSD diagnosis 3 months after the injury. The examination of cutoff values that achieve enhanced sensitivity in a screening context - where sensitivity is prioritized - while maintaining a high level of specificity suggests that a lower cutoff of around 6 points may serve as a more sensitive (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.56) valid alternative cutoff score. The PEDS-ES allows for successful early screening of risk for traumatic stress symptoms in young children after single accidental injury. It enables early identification of individuals who are at risk for developing PTSD and need further monitoring of symptoms, diagnostic assessment and treatment. In young children at emergency settings of hospitals, development of PTSD often goes unrecognized, while consequences can be debilitating.The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale-Early Screener (PEDS-ES) for PTSD risk in young children after accidental injury shows fair predictive power.Young children at increased risk for PTSD can be identified early and offered secondary preventive interventions.",

We developed an innovative burn Polydopamine-Alginate-Zinc ion (Zn ) dressing (APBM) using a synergistic approach combining passive bacterial inhibition and active sterilization mechanisms. APBM was synthesized through a facile two-step process, integrating an effective bacterial adhesion-blocking mechanism with active sterilization via Zn . In vitro studies demonstrated that APBM achieved over 99 % antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and exhibited notable activity against Candida albicans (C. albicans). The antibacterial effect persisted for 11 days against S. aureus and 9 days against E. coli. APBM exhibited an exudate absorption rate twice that of conventional polyurethane (PU) sponges. In a rat burn model, APBM enhanced micro angiogenesis, collagen deposition and reduced inflammation, resulting in a 27.5 % faster wound healing rate compared to the blank group. This performance was superior to dressings employing only a single antimicrobial strategy and conventional sponges. Overall, APBM showed significant potential as a composite functional dressing addressing infection prevention, exudate management, and healing promotion, presenting a promising solution to the major challenges faced in burn wound care.",

  "abstract": "Inflammation is a principal cause of sensorineural hearing loss resulting from cochlear injury. However, current research investigating the mechanisms of sensorineural inflammatory injury remains inadequate. Cochlear inflammation was induced by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the otic bulla (OB) and posterior semicircular canal (PSCC). Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded, and cochlear tissue alterations were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence. Levels of cochlear inflammation were quantified using a cytokine array. Additionally, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice were employed to evaluate sensorineural neuroprotection. LPS injection into the PSCC caused more pronounced and stable cochlear inflammatory damage compared to injection into the OB. LPS exposure led to significant loss of cochlear hair cells, atrophy of the stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion damage. Furthermore, LPS treatment upregulated TLR4 receptor expression, increased the number of Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) positive cells, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the cochlea. TLR4 knockout (TLR4-KO) mice demonstrated reduced LPS-induced cochlear sensorineural damage. LPS injection into the PSCC induces sensorineural tissue damage in the cochlea and results in sensorineural hearing loss. These findings suggest that TLR4 inhibition can alleviate cochlear inflammation-induced sensorineural hearing loss. TLR4 represents a potential therapeutic target for sensorineural hearing loss.",

  "abstract": "Bone metastases and pathological fractures significantly impact the prognosis and quality of life in cancer patients. However, clinical and radiological features alone have been shown to fail to predict skeletal related events of a bone metastasis (SREs). This study focuses on key molecular players including Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), Integrins, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Parathormone-related Protein (PTHrP). The RANK/RANKL/Osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathway, and N-terminal peptide (NTx), involved in the metastatic process and bone integrity disruption. Elevated levels of these molecules have been pointed out as potential biomarkers for predicting SREs, but they have been poorly investigated. Moreover, batimastat, marimastat, tanomastat, andecaliximab, and HIV protease targeting MMPs; Volociximab/M200, cilengitide, abituzumab, and FAK inhibitors targeting integrins; LDN193189, DMH1, and ISLR modulators targeting BMPs; and PTH (7-33)-CBD targeting PTHrP have shown promising results antagonizing these molecules, but no effect on preventing and managing metastatic fractures has been assessed yet. This paper underscores the importance of advanced molecular biology and transcriptomics in identifying novel therapeutic targets. The integration of these biomarkers with clinical and radiological assessments using artificial intelligence tools could revolutionize the diagnostics and treatment strategies for patients with bone metastases.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to explore the feasibility and accuracy of deep learning-based pediatric behavioral audiometry. The research provides a dedicated pediatric posture detection dataset, which contains a large number of video clips from children's behavioral hearing tests, encompassing various typical hearing test actions. A detection platform based on this dataset is also constructed, named intelligent diagnostic model of pediatric hearing based on optimized transformer (DoT); further, an estimation model of patient skeletal keypoints based on optimized transformer (POTR) was proposed to estimate human skeleton points. Based on this, the DoT approach was handled to perform posture recognition on videos of children undergoing behavioral hearing tests, thus enabling an automated hearing testing process. Through this platform, children's movements can be monitored and analyzed in real-time, allowing for the assessment of their hearing levels. Moreover, the study establishes decision rules based on specific actions, combining professional knowledge and experience in audiology to evaluate children's hearing levels based on their movement status. Firstly, we gathered image and video data related to posture in the process of conditioned play audiometry to test the hearing of 120 children aged 2.5 to 6 years old. Next, we built and optimized a deep learning model suitable for pediatric posture recognition. Finally, in the deployment and application phase, we deployed the trained pediatric posture recognition model into real-world application environments. We found that for children aged 2.5 - 4 years, the sensitivity of artificial behavior audiometry (0.900) was not as high as that of AI behavior audiometry (0.929), but the specificity of artificial behavior audiometry (0.824) and Area Under Curve (AUC) (0.901) was higher than that of AI behavior audiometry. For children aged 4-6 years, the sensitivity (0.943), specificity (0.947), and AUC (0.924) of artificial behavioral audiometry were higher than those of AI behavioral audiometry. The application of these rules facilitates objective assessment and diagnosis of children's hearing, providing essential foundations for early screening and treatment of children with hearing disorders.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: Registration number ChiCTR2100050416.",

  "abstract": "Adherence to hydroxyurea has been low historically. The InCharge Health app demonstrates increased adherence with hydroxyurea, but engagement has not been fully investigated. This study investigated the association between InCharge Health app perceptions and app engagement among adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). We obtained user perceptions of InCharge with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) among participants of the \"Integration of mHealth into Sickle Cell Disease Care to Increase Hydroxyurea Utilization\" study. Days of app use were correlated with reported patient-reported outcomes of interest, ease of use, the utility of features, and importance of features. Of 293 enrolled participants, 284 remained active in the study, and 206 (72.5%) completed the 24-week MARS survey. App Interest was positively correlated with app use (p = 0.01) and self-reported days of app use (p = 0.0008). Perceived ease of use trended toward significance with greater app use (p = 0.06). Most individuals (72.0%, 144/200) agreed the app helped them remember to take hydroxyurea, with trends toward higher days of app use (p = 0.07). Those who used the app more agreed they would continue to use it after the study (p = 0.04). Most individuals (54.3%) reported that reminders to take their hydroxyurea were the most important app feature. In this study, positive perceptions toward the application features influenced app use and intention to continue using the application. Determining features that drive application utilization can have a positive impact when an app, such as the InCharge app, is demonstrated to improve adherence with proven therapy.",

  "abstract": "This study compared three methods of acoustic algorithm-supported extraction and analysis of vocal tremor properties (i.e., rate, extent, and regularity of intensity level and fundamental frequency modulation): (a) visual perception and manual data extraction, (b) semi-automated data extraction, and (c) fully automated data extraction. Forty-five midvowel sustained [a:] and [i:] audio recordings were collected as part of a scientific project to learn about the physiologic substrates of vocal tremor. This convenience data set contained vowels with a representative variety in vocal tremor severity. First, the vocal tremor properties in intensity level and fundamental frequency tracks were visually inspected and manually measured using Praat software. Second, the vocal tremor properties were determined using two Praat scripts: automated with the script of Maryn et al. (2019) and semi-automated with an adjusted version of this script to enable the user to intervene with the signal processing. The reliability of manual vocal tremor property measurement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The properties as measured with the two scripts (automated vs. semi-automated) were compared with the manually determined properties using correlation and diagnostic accuracy statistical methods. With intraclass correlation coefficients between .770 and .914, the reliability of the manual method was acceptable. The semi-automated method correlated with manual property measures better and was more accurate in diagnosing vocal tremor than the automated method. Manual acoustic measurement of vocal tremor properties can be laborious and time-consuming. Automated or semi-automated acoustic methods may improve efficiency in vocal tremor property measurement in clinical as well as research settings. Although both Praat script-supported methods in this study yielded acceptable validity with the manual data measurements as a referent, the semi-automated method showed the best outcomes. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28873088.",

  "abstract": "Drug and chemical nephrotoxicity is a common cause of kidney disorders. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the recent progress in applying nanocurcumins (nano-CURs) to prevent and mitigate drug and chemical-induced nephrotoxicity, highlighting their underlying protective mechanisms and therapeutic potential. A comprehensive search of experimental and clinical studies was conducted in various databases, including Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The studies were analyzed for improvements in bioavailability, mechanisms of action, and outcomes in reducing kidney damage. After extracting the data and entering it into an Excel sheet, the essential information and the related knowledge on consequences and mechanisms were collected. The collected information was discussed and analyzed. The antioxidant property of nano-CURs in dealing with nephrotoxicity is one of their most critical nephroprotective properties. They also exhibit potent anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and anti-pyroptotic effects. Moreover, nano-CURs improve mitochondrial function, modulate kidney biochemical markers, modulate electrolyte imbalance, reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and improve kidney histopathological changes and autophagy, offering protection against nephrotoxicity induced by various drugs and chemicals. Nano-CURs significantly improve histopathological changes. Animal models have demonstrated reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, causing improved renal function and histological outcomes. Nano-CURs have shown promising nephroprotective effects in experimental studies. However, these results have not been significant in clinical trial studies. Future research should focus on clinical trials and optimizing formulations for broader therapeutic applications.",

We retrospectively recruited 56 EPE, 50 LPE patients and 92 normotensive controls from three tertiary hospitals and used clinical and laboratory data in early pregnancy. Models for EPE and LPE were fitted with the use of patient' clinical, multi-omics and laboratory data. By comparing multi-omics and laboratory test variables between EPE, LPE and healthy controls, we identified sets of differentially expressed biomarkers, including 49 and 33 metabolites, 28 and 36 proteins as well as 5 and 7 laboratory variables associated with EPE and LPE respectively. Using the random forest algorithm, we developed a prediction model using seven clinical factors, seven metabolites, five laboratory test variables. The model yielded the highest accuracy for EPE prediction with good sensitivity (87.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.64%-97.34%) and specificity (94.1%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%). We also developed a prediction model that exhibited high accuracy in separating LPE from controls (sensitivity: 66.67%, 95% CI: 43.03%-85.41%; specificity: 94.12%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%) using seven clinical factors, five metabolites and eight proteins. Our study has identified a set of significant omics and laboratory features for PE prediction.

  "abstract": "https://clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCT04892173; EudraCT Number: 2021-002163-22. Locally advanced head and neck cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the head or neck region and has spread to nearby areas. Older patients with this cancer often have other health problems or may be frail, which can make it harder for them to tolerate the usual treatment of cisplatin (an anti-cancer drug) combined with radiation. This can make it difficult for some older patients to receive the standard treatment, so there is a need for other treatment options.NBTXR3 is a new type of treatment that helps improve how radiation therapy works. It is a special kind of nanoparticle that is injected into cancer cells. When radiation is given, these nanoparticles help the radiation kill more cancer cells and slow down cancer growth. Research suggests NBTXR3 also helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively and that NBTXR3 can make cancer treatment more effective, with better results for patients.NANORAY-312 is a study looking at how NBTXR3 works when used with radiation (and some patients may also receive cetuximab, a drug that helps the immune system fight cancer) in treating older patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. The study is testing whether this treatment can be a good alternative for those who cannot receive cisplatin. The study is ongoing, and its main goal is to see whether patients who receive NBTXR3 will live longer than those who will not receive the treatment.",

Patients with at least one comorbidity accounted for 35% of total patients with hypertension 6% (20), congenital heart disease 5% (n = 18), and seizure disorder 4% (n = 15) representing the most common comorbidities. Most common indications for liver transplant were biliary atresia (21%) and progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis (20%). The most common reasons for ED visits were gastrointestinal symptoms (32%), pulmonary symptoms (22%), and infectious symptoms (16%). Patients' average length of stay in the hospital was 4 ± 10.7 days. Visits within the first 6 months accounted for 58% of total visits in the first year with first and second visits accounting for 47% of total emergency department visits. The study highlights the high frequency of emergency department visits in pediatric subgroup as well the first 6 months as a critical period for follow-up.

We recruited CRSwNP patients who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery and classified them into three groups based on BMI: normal weight, overweight, and obesity. All patients were followed for 3 years and divided into recurrence and nonrecurrence groups. The histopathological features and the impact of BMI on the risk of postoperative recurrence were analyzed through comparative analysis. A total of 577 CRSwNP patients completed the follow-up, with 197 experiencing postoperative recurrence. Recurrence rates, tissue eosinophil counts, and interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-17A expression levels were significantly higher in the overweight and obesity groups compared to the normal weight group. Additionally, within the overweight and obesity groups, patients with recurrence had elevated tissue eosinophil counts and IL-5 and IL-17A levels compared to the other two groups. Notably, tissues collected during revision surgery showed increased eosinophil counts, IL-5 and IL-17A levels compared to baseline, particularly in obese patients. Both logistic regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of CRSwNP recurrence. Elevated BMI presented significant impacts on the histopathological changes and the risk of postoperative recurrence in CRSwNP patients. Overweight and obesity aggravated tissue eosinophil infiltration, and IL-5 and IL-17A expressions contributing to the recurrent mechanisms of CRSwNP.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort-study of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from the first to third wave (March 2020-October 2021) in Yaounde-Cameroon. RT-PCR was carried out on the participants using nasopharyngeal swabs after every 7 days. SARS-CoV-2 positivity duration was evaluated from the first to last positive PCR-test before a negative result. Epi-info V.7.0 was used for data analyses with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. A total of 282 participants were enrolled. The mean age was 41 ± 14 years, with male predominant (62.1%). We had 15.6% symptomatic participants of which 59% had cough. The overall median positivity duration was 15[IQR: 9-23] days with 15[IQR: 13-22] in the first, 17[IQR: 12-26] in the second and 9[IQR: 6-12] in the third wave (p < 0.0001). Positivity duration was significantly higher in males (16 versus 14 days, p = 0.03) those aged [35-45] years (16 days) followed by those ≥ 46 years(15 days); p = 0.008). Positivity duration was not affected by presence or absence of symptoms (p = 0.80). No significant correlation was found with viral load (r = 0.03; p = 0.61).

  "abstract": "to compare the effect of using a pre-reacted glass-ionomer (PRG) barrier coat versus silver diamine fluoride (SDF) varnish treatment before orthodontic bracket bonding to prevent white spot lesions (WSL). The effect of these materials on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets was evaluated through an in vitro study. One hundred-five premolars were used; forty-two specimens were designated for comparing SDF versus PRG-barrier coat using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with elemental analysis and microhardness testing (n = 21/group). Tested materials were applied in a split-tooth design protocol (side A: control, side B: treated). Measurement was made at baseline and after bracket placement and exposure to the pH cycle. A polarized light microscope (PLM) was used for qualitative examination. Sixty-three specimens were intended for shear bond strength (SBS) testing after the pH cycle as follows: control group (no treatment), SDF group, and PRG-barrier coat group (n = 21/group). Statistical analysis was done using Paired T-test. SEM for specimens treated by SDF or PRG revealed enamel remineralization with calcium deposits and small porosities between the crystallites. All groups had a significant difference regarding the Ca/P ratio and microhardness. Baseline hardness for both groups was significantly higher than the treated sides, which was significantly higher than the non-treated sides (P = 0.000*) and (P = 0.000*) in accordance with the Paired T-test. In comparing SDF with PRG-coat groups, the T-test showed non-significant differences in mean differences between treated and baseline hardness values (T = 0.32, P = 0.74). PLM for treated specimens by SDF or PRG depicted an evident remineralized surface enamel layer. SBS values did not differ significantly between groups. As confirmed by SEM and PLM, applying either SDF varnish or PRG-barrier coat before bonding orthodontic brackets could effectively prevent the development of WSL and achieve surface enamel protection. In addition, the two applied varnishes showed slightly higher shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets compared to the control group, with the SDF slightly higher than PRG. Also, clinical translation is needed in future research to evaluate the study.",

This study evaluated the remineralization efficiency of three commercial treatments on artificially demineralized primary enamel. Forty exfoliated primary anterior teeth were demineralized and divided into five groups: untreated control, artificial saliva, fluoridated toothpaste, Curasept toothpaste, and BioMin toothpaste. The treatments were applied for 28 days. Remineralization efficacy was assessed using Vickers microhardness testing, surface roughness measurement, and Scanning electron microscope combined with EDX (SEM-EDX). One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test were used for statistical analysis. Microhardness and surface roughness tests confirmed BioMin's superior remineralization potential. Scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated enamel exhibited extensive demineralization, whereas treated groups displayed varying degrees of remineralization. BioMin demonstrated the highest calcium, phosphate, and fluoride incorporation, followed by Curasept and fluoridated toothpaste. The artificial saliva group showed no significant improvement over the control. BioMin, followed by Curasept and fluoridated toothpaste, effectively remineralized demineralized enamel. BioMin's bioactive glass formulation provided the highest mineral gain, suggesting its potential for non-invasive enamel restoration in pediatric dentistry.",

The author reports a case of a nulliparous woman in her mid-30s with a history of TSC and prior radical nephrectomy for renal angiomyolipoma. She presented with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhoea and lower abdominal pain. Imaging studies were suggestive of a large ruptured haemorrhagic ovarian cyst with the presence of blood in the uterine cavity. Laparoscopy-guided biopsy was performed by a gastrointestinal surgeon due to extensive adhesions. Intraoperative findings included a friable mass adherent to the pouch of Douglas and dense ovarian adhesions. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was put on hormonal therapy. This case highlights the complex interplay of TSC-related pathology with gynaecological emergencies, emphasising the role of multidisciplinary management.",

  "abstract": "The preservation of the pelvic autonomic nervous system in total mesorectal excision remains challenging to date. The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study. The artificial intelligence model for real-time visual neurorecognition in total mesorectal excision was successfully established for the first time in China. Better identification of these autonomic nerves should allow for better preservation of urogenital function, but further research is needed to validate this claim. See Video Abstract . ANTECEDENTES:La preservación del sistema nervioso autónomo pélvico en la escisión mesorrectal total sigue siendo un desafío hasta la fecha. La aplicación de la laparoscopia ha permitido la visualización de estructuras anatómicas finas; sin embargo, la tasa de disfunción urogenital sigue siendo alta.OBJETIVO:Establecer un sistema de reconocimiento neurológico con inteligencia artificial para realizar el reconocimiento neurológico durante la escisión mesorrectal total.DISEÑO Y ESCENARIO:Este estudio retrospectivo se realizó en un solo hospital.PACIENTES:Se recopilaron retrospectivamente imágenes intraoperatorias o capturas de pantalla de video de pacientes con cáncer de recto ingresados en el Departamento de Cirugía Gastrointestinal, del Hospital Memorial Sun Yat-sen, de la Universidad Sun Yat-sen, entre enero de 2016 y diciembre de 2023.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN:Intersección media sobre unión, precisión, recuperación y F1 del modelo.RESULTADOS:Se incluyeron un total de 1424 imágenes intraoperatorias de alta calidad en el grupo de entrenamiento. El modelo propuesto se obtuvo después de 700 interaciones. La intersección media sobre la unión fue de 0,75 y aumentó lentamente con el aumento del tiempo de entrenamiento. La precisión y la recuperación de la categoría de nervio fueron de 0,7494 y 0,6587, respectivamente, y el F1 fue de 0,7011. A partir de la predicción del video, podemos observar que el modelo logra una alta tasa de precisión, lo que podría facilitar el neurorreconocimiento efectivo.LIMITACIÓN:Este fue un estudio de un solo centro.CONCLUSIÓN:El modelo de inteligencia artificial para el neurorreconocimiento visual en tiempo real en la escisión mesorrectal total se estableció con éxito por primera vez en China. Una mejor identificación de estos nervios autónomos debería permitir una mejor preservación de la función urogenital, pero se necesita más investigación para validar esta afirmación.

  "abstract": "Objective Presently, societal guidelines differ regarding evaluation and management of variations in placental cord insertion (PCI). This variation may in part be secondary to inconsistency in reported risk associated with marginal and velamentous cord insertion (VCI). The objective of this study is to compare perinatal outcomes based on placental cord insertion (PCI) site in pregnancies at risks for fetal growth disorders. Study design This was a secondary analysis of singletons with growth assessment between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation. Fetuses with chromosomal or congenital malformations were excluded. The primary outcomes studied were neonatal small for gestational age (SGA), birthweight, and gestational age (GA) at delivery. Other outcomes included a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes, a composite score of obstetrical outcomes, and hypoglycemia. Categorical data was analyzed with X2 and continuous data with Kruskal Wallis tests. Pairwise comparisons and Bonferroni corrections were utilized. Logistic regression model was applied to assess the association of hypoglycemia with velamentous cord insertion. Results Of the 1054 fetuses, 660 had confirmed PCI site by pathology review. Of those, 609 (92%) had central cord insertion, 37 (5.6%) had marginal, and 14 (2.1%) had velamentous. There was no difference in SGA or preterm birth. Those with a VCI had lower GA at delivery than placentas with central cord insertion (37.6 vs. 38.6, p=0.032) and higher rates of hypoglycemia than those with other types of PCIs, 26.2% for central cord insertion, 20% for marginal, and 71.4% for VCI (p<0.001). After controlling for confounders, VCI remained significantly associated with hypoglycemia (adjusted odds ratio = 5.52 95% CI 1.54-19.82). Conclusions Velamentous cord insertion was associated with lower GA at delivery and higher rates of neonatal hypoglycemia compared to other PCIs. Additional studies are needed to assess the association of marginal and velamentous cord insertion and adverse perinatal outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Desmoplastic reaction is recognized as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

  "abstract": "Early identification of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children is important to prevent chronic symptoms and long-term negative consequences. However, PTSD often goes unrecognized in the emergency setting of hospitals and screening methods for young children are lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of an early screening tool for PTSD in a sample of young children (0-7 years) after unintentional injury. The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale - Early Screener (PEDS-ES) was administered to parents of children referred to the Emergency Department within 7 days post-accident (  = 82), and a validated interview for PTSD was administered 3 months after the accident as criterion measure: the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA). Diagnostic accuracy of the PEDS-ES was inspected using area under the curve analyses including sensitivity, specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Value. After three months PTSD diagnosis was established in 21% of the children. Use of the PEDS-ES within 7 days after the injury showed fair accuracy with AUC = .727. Sensitivity (0.65) and specificity (0.73) for the suggested cutoff of 8 were moderate for predicting PTSD diagnosis 3 months after the injury. The examination of cutoff values that achieve enhanced sensitivity in a screening context - where sensitivity is prioritized - while maintaining a high level of specificity suggests that a lower cutoff of around 6 points may serve as a more sensitive (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.56) valid alternative cutoff score. The PEDS-ES allows for successful early screening of risk for traumatic stress symptoms in young children after single accidental injury. It enables early identification of individuals who are at risk for developing PTSD and need further monitoring of symptoms, diagnostic assessment and treatment. In young children at emergency settings of hospitals, development of PTSD often goes unrecognized, while consequences can be debilitating.The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale-Early Screener (PEDS-ES) for PTSD risk in young children after accidental injury shows fair predictive power.Young children at increased risk for PTSD can be identified early and offered secondary preventive interventions.",

  "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction (SD) and depression are prevalent issues that significantly affect both physical and mental health. This study aimed to explore the association between sexual function (SF) and depression in reproductive-aged population and further examine the mediating role of knowledge regarding the effect of sexual dysfunction on fertility (KSDF). This study enrolled a total of 10 761 participants aged 20-40 from 31 regions, including 5259 males and 5502 females, with a median age of 29.0 years. Basic demographic data were collected initially, followed by clinical data acquisition. The International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF5), the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), the Female Sexual Function Index-19 (FSFI-19), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Disease Knowledge Questionnaire. The study revealed a significant bidirectional association between SF and depression among the population. Specifically, poorer SF was correlated with higher severity of depressive (IIEF5 [β = -0.155, P < .001], PEDT [β = 0.311, P < .001], and FSFI-19 [β = -0.059, P < .001]). Conversely, higher severity of depressive was associated with poorer SF (IIEF5 [β = -0.202, P < .001], PEDT [β = 0.249, P < .001], and FSFI-19 [β = -0.191, P < 0.001]). Furthermore, in males, the KSDF mediated the bidirectional associations between SF and depression. Specifically, the mediating proportions were as follows: KSDF mediated 3.00% of the association between IIEF5 and depression, and 2.20% of the association between PEDT and depression; similarly, for the association between depression and SF, KSDF mediated 2.50% of the association between depression and IIEF5 and 2.20% between depression and PEDT. However, no such mediation was observed in females. This provides new insights for the clinical management of these issues in the male reproductive-aged population. These findings suggest that enhancing this knowledge could interrupt bidirectional association between impaired SF and depression in this demographic, potentially alleviating both conditions without requiring additional interventions. However, cross-sectional study design does not allow us to draw corresponding causal conclusions. The current study further demonstrated a significant bidirectional association between SF and depression among the reproductive-aged population, and importantly, the KSDF was found to mediate this association in males.",

  "abstract": "After neoadjuvant therapy, pathologic analysis of rectal cancer resected specimens may show a complete response in the primary tissue cancer with residual tumor in the lymph nodes (ypT0N+). The aim of this study was to describe the 5-year overall survival and factors associated with survival of ypT0N+ patients with rectal cancer who had neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and to compare these patients' survival with patients in other pathologic categories. We conducted a retrospective analysis. We used the National Cancer Database. We identified patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total neoadjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery between 2006 and 2016. Besides ypT0N+, 5 pathologic categories were identified: ypT0N0, ypT1-2N0, ypT3-4N0, ypT1-2N+, and ypT3-4N+. The primary outcome measure was 5-year overall survival. We included 30,751 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A total of 342 patients developed ypT0N+, of whom 181 (52.9%) received total neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients who received total neoadjuvant therapy, developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, ypT0N+ disease was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between ypT0N+ and ypT3-4N0 or ypT1-2N+. Similar findings were noticed among patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ypT0N+, older age, male gender, and higher number of positive lymph nodes were all associated with a decrease in the overall survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study, lack of variables describing the chemotherapy and radiation regimens used, and paucity of data on disease-specific survival or recurrence. Developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, it was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+.

Primary outcomes were changes in pure tone average (PTA) of affected and contralateral ears. Patients who failed a newborn hearing screen (NBHS) were considered 'congenital' onset, those who passed \"postnatal,\" and those without \"unknown.\" Demographics, infectious/genetic workup, audiograms, imaging, and hearing aid use were collected. A total of 1264 charts reviewed, 476 subjects included: 156 congenital, 252 postnatal, and 68 unknown onset. The mean (SD) of the first PTA was 53.8(29.4) dB for affected and 10.6(5.8) dB for unaffected ears. Thirty-nine percent followed up > 5 years. Change in PTA over time was 3.0(14.5) dB for affected and -1.7(7.4) dB for unaffected ears. The congenital subgroup had poorer hearing in the affected ear at the first audiogram (p < 0.0001) and was more likely to have progressive hearing loss (p = 0.0040) than the postnatal subgroup. Imaging in 296 patients revealed ipsilateral abnormalities in 26.6% of CTs and 39.6% of MRIs. Absent/hypoplastic cochlear nerve was the most common abnormal and was associated with poorer hearing than those with normal nerves (p < 0.0001). Enlarged vestibular aqueduct was not associated with progression of hearing loss. Hearing in both the affected and contralateral ears remained stable after the first audiogram in > 80% of patients. Patients with congenital loss had poorer hearing at diagnosis and were more likely to have progression than those with postnatal loss. MRI was more sensitive than CT in detecting an anatomic cause of SNHL, and absent/hypoplastic cochlear nerve was the most common finding.",

  "abstract": "We analyzed blood serum samples from two unique female occupational cohorts - 60 nurses and 40 office workers in San Francisco, CA - using liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (quadrupole time-of-flight). Applying a nontargeted analysis (NTA) approach, we sought to isolate occupationally related chemical exposures that were unique to nurses by flagging features that were different from office workers in abundance (mean; 95th percentile) or detection frequency. Of 9828 negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) and 6898 positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) detected chemical features, 1094 and 938, respectively, were higher in nurses, possibly due to workplace exposures. We deciphered the molecular structures of these chemical features by applying data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and targeted MS/MS approaches to pooled samples from each occupational group, and we annotated them using spectral MS/MS databases in MS-DIAL. Nurses had higher concentrations of 14 chemicals that we identified at Schymanski Level 1 (N = 6) or 2 (N = 8), as well as 20 tentatively identified chemicals without spectra. Several chemicals may be occupationally relevant for nurses, including a PFAS (6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid), tridecanedioic acid, salicylic acid, and the medications acetaminophen and theophylline. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply NTA to elucidate novel chemical exposures in nurses.",

  "abstract": "Systemic inflammation contributes to the progression of malignancies. The preoperative lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio has recently been shown to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery, but its prognostic value remains unclear in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. This study aimed to examine the prognostic values of inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, focusing on the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. This is a retrospective study from a prospectively collected database. This study was conducted at a high-volume multidisciplinary tertiary cancer center in Japan. The subjects were 756 consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who received systemic chemotherapy from 2000 to 2015. The prognostic value of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was evaluated by univariable and multivariable analyses. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to compare the prognostic impact of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio with the impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, or the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score. The primary outcomes measured were the correlations of prognostic scores with overall survival. Median survival times of patients with high, intermediate, and low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratios were 29.4, 19.3, and 13.1 months (p < 0.001). In all subgroups according to key prognostic factors (performance status, use of targeted agents, pretreatment CEA levels, tumor sidedness, M category, and primary tumor resection), patient prognosis could be clearly stratified into 3 groups by the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was independently associated with reduced survival (low vs high: HR 1.96, p < 0.001; intermediate vs high: HR 1.44, p < 0.001). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was the most sensitive predictor of survival among all inflammation-based prognostic scores on a continuous basis. This study was retrospective in nature. The lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio is a useful prognostic biomarker for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer and could contribute to accurate prognostication and therapeutic decision making.

Se realizó análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo para comparar el impacto pronóstico de la proteína linfocito-C-reactiva con el de la proporción de neutrófilos a linfocitos, la proporción de plaquetas a linfocitos, la proporción de linfocitos a monocitos o la proporción de puntuación pronóstica segun escala de Glasgow modificada.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Correlacion de las puntuaciones pronósticas con la supervivencia global.RESULTADOS:La mediana de supervivencia de los pacientes con niveles altos, intermedios y bajos de proteína C reactiva de linfocitos fue de 29,4, 19,3 y 13,1 meses, respectivamente (p <0,001). En todos los subgrupos de acuerdo con los factores pronósticos clave (estado funcional, uso de agentes dirigidos, niveles de antígeno carcinoembrionario antes del tratamiento, lado del tumor, categoría M y resección del tumor primario), el pronóstico del paciente podría estratificarse claramente en tres grupos por linfocito a C- proteína reactiva. El análisis multivariable reveló que la disminución de linfocitos a proteína C reactiva se asoció de forma independiente con una supervivencia reducida (baja frente a alta: cociente de riesgo 1,96, p <0,001; intermedio frente a alto: cociente de riesgo 1,44, p <0,001). El análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo reveló que de linfocito a proteína C reactiva era el predictor de supervivencia más sensible entre todas las puntuaciones de pronóstico basadas en inflamación de forma continua.LIMITACIONES:Este estudio fue de naturaleza retrospectiva.CONCLUSIONES:La proteína C reactiva de linfocitos a C es un biomarcador pronóstico útil para el cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable y podría contribuir a un pronóstico preciso y a la toma de decisiones terapéuticas.

  "abstract": "To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic responses and prognostic features of   fusion gene for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L. The main immunophenotype was common-B ALL (44 cases, 91.7%). Other leukemia fusion genes such as   and   were not observed in this cohort of patients. All patients received the treatment of NPCLC-ALL2008 protocol, and 5 cases (10.4%) occurred poor prednisone response. All the 48 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction treatments. The last follow-up date was April 30, 2023. A total of 5 children relapsed, including 1 case with intermediate risk and 4 cases with high risk. The recurrence rate in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the intermediate- and low-risk groups (both   < 0.05). Most relapsed children had elevated WBC counts at initial diagnosis. Among them, WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was observed in 4 cases. The recurrence rate among children with WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was significantly higher than that with WBC counts <100×10 /L (  < 0.01). Four deaths occurred in this cohort, of which 3 died of leukemia recurrence. The 10-year event-free survival rate and 10-year overall survival rate of the 48 children with positive   fusion gene were 87.5%±4.8% and 91.7%±4.0%, respectively. In ALL children with positive   fusion gene, those with elevated WBC counts and high risk stratification at initial diagnosis are more likely to experience recurrence. Recurrence is the main cause of death in this group. It is suggested that such kind of children receive more intensive chemotherapy or undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as early as possible to further improve prognosis.  融合基因阳性儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病临床特点及预后分析. 探讨儿童   融合基因阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的临床特点、治疗反应及预后特征。. 回顾性分析2010年7月至2017年11月于本院初诊的ALL患儿837例，实时荧光定量PCR技术检测出   阳性患儿48例，收集其临床资料进行分析。. 48例   融合基因阳性患儿中男26例，女22例，发病年龄9个月-13岁。初诊低危、中危及高危分别为2例（4.2%）、32例（66.7%）和14例（29.1%）。初诊外周血白细胞数<50×10 /L者25例（53.2%），(50-100)×10 /L者11例（23.4%），≥100×10 /L者11例（23.4%）。免疫表型主要是以common-B ALL为主（44例，占91.7%）。48例   阳性患儿未检测到  等其他白血病融合基因。所有患儿均接受中国儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病2008方案治疗，其中，泼尼松反应不良者5例（10.4%）。48例患儿在诱导治疗结束后均获得完全缓解。至随访截止时间（2023年4月30日），共5例患儿出现复发，其中中危1例、高危4例，高危组患儿的复发率明显高于中、低危组（均  < 0.05）；绝大多数复发患儿初诊白细胞数较高，其中4例≥100×10 /L，初诊白细胞数≥100×10 /L组患儿的复发率明显高于<100×10 /L组（  < 0.01）。本组共有4例患儿死亡，其中因白血病复发导致死亡的患儿有3例。48例   融合基因阳性患儿10年无事件生存率及10年总生存率分别为87.5%±4.8%、91.7%±4.0%。. 在   融合基因阳性ALL患儿中，初诊白细胞计数高及危险度分层较高的患儿更容易出现复发，复发是患儿的主要死亡原因，建议此类患儿接受更高强度的化疗或尽早进行造血干细胞移植以进一步改善其预后。.",

  "abstract": "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Identifying predictors of length of hospital stay (LOS) in PROM patients can aid in improving management and prognosis. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was searched to acquire data on PROM individuals. A univariable analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) were adopted to identify factors closely related to LOS. Next, the change trends in the key variable over multiple time points were determined using a latent class trajectory model (LCTM). The association of these trajectories with LOS was analyzed using GLMs. The retrospective study finally enrolled 868 samples. The significant factors included initial hemoglobin, chorioamnionitis, premature birth, and rupture to delivery interval <24 h. Notably, higher initial hemoglobin level was independently associated with shorter LOS (β = -0.599; 95% CI = [-0.846, -0.352]; p < 0.05). The stratified analysis confirmed this association in all subgroups except those with chorioamnionitis. The LCTM identified three hemoglobin trajectories. Compared to other trajectory groups, the \"lowest, declining\" group had longer LOS (p < 0.05). PROM patients with lower initial hemoglobin levels and the \"lowest, declining\" trajectory group were linked to longer LOS. Monitoring and managing hemoglobin levels is important in improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

La supervivencia general disminuyó al aumentar el estadio del cáncer, pero no fue diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal. La razón de riesgo para la sobrevida libre de recurrencia por aumento de cm2 en el área de la superficie grasa perirrenal fue de 1.00 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0.99-1.01) ajustada por edad, sexo, categoría de la Sociedad Americana de Anestesiólogos, ubicación del tumor y complicación postoperatoria según Clavien-Dindo ≥ 2) La incidencia acumulada de recurrencia con muerte como un riesgo competitivo no fue estadísticamente diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal (p = 0.06). Los análisis de subgrupos mostraron una tendencia no significativa para que los hombres con un área de superficie menor en grasa perirrenal tengan un menor riesgo de recurrencia y las mujeres un mayor riesgo.LIMITACIONES:En todos los estudios basados en registros puede haber errores distribuidos aleatoriamente. Los resultados solo pueden generalizarse a resecciones de colon. Nuestra cohorte osciló durante un gran lapso de años.CONCLUSIONES:No se encontró asociación entre el área de superficie de la grasa perirrenal y la sobrevida general, ni con la sobrevida libre de recurrencia o la incidencia acumulada de recurrencia específica de la causa en pacientes sometidos a resección de colon por cáncer.

  "abstract": "BackgroundThe lack of adequate resources in international cooperation limits the study of surgical specimens. The literature on inexpensive and widely available fixation media is scarce.Materials and MethodsSpecimens were prospectively collected during a surgical cooperation campaign in Senegal, where a team from Spain provided surgical care to the local population. The lesions were fixed in parallel using 10% formalin and 70% ethyl alcohol. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical techniques (IHC) were performed. Histological images were independently evaluated by two senior and two junior pathologists through an anonymized questionnaire.ResultsThree surgical specimens were included: 1 lymphoid hyperplasia (3 H&E, 4 IHC), 1 seborrheic keratosis (2 H&E, 5 IHC), and 1 branchial remnant (2 H&E, 2 IHC). Fixation times were similar in all the specimens (10-13 days). All formalin H&E were diagnostic. Ethyl alcohol H&E was 100% diagnostic on 5/7 slides and 75% in the two remaining slides. In most slides, pathologists preferred formalin. Keratin 7, P40, EMA, keratin AE1/AE3, and TTF1 were 100% diagnostic in both groups. CD20, CD45, and EMA were 100% diagnostic in formalin and 75% diagnostic in ethyl alcohol. CD10 was 75% diagnostic in formalin and 25% diagnostic in ethyl alcohol. BCL6 was 75% diagnostic in formalin and 100% diagnostic in ethyl alcohol. IHC preferences were inconsistent.ConclusionsEthyl alcohol shows poorer fixation than formalin but enables diagnosis in most specimens. Immunoreactivity varies by tissue and stain. Further studies are needed to validate these results.",

  "abstract": "Mixed urinary incontinence, which includes both stress and urgency urinary incontinence, adversely affects quality of life and can be difficult to manage. Studies comparing procedural-based treatments for mixed urinary incontinence are lacking. To determine whether intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA is more effective than midurethral sling for the treatment of mixed urinary incontinence in females. Randomized, superiority trial involving females (aged ≥21 years) with moderate to severe bother from both stress and urgency urinary incontinence who had unsuccessful conservative treatments and oral medications. The study was conducted at 7 US sites with enrollment between July 2020 and September 2022; the last date of follow-up was December 29, 2023. Intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA, 100 U (treatment focused on the urgency component), vs surgical synthetic mesh midurethral sling (treatment focused on the stress component). Recipients of onabotulinumtoxinA could receive an additional injection between 3 and 6 months. All participants could receive additional treatment (including crossover to the alternative treatment) between 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was change at 6 months in mixed incontinence symptoms as measured by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) total score (0-300 points; higher scores indicate worse symptoms; minimal clinically important difference, 26.1). Secondary outcomes included stress and irritative UDI subscores. Among 150 females randomized, 137 were treated, had postbaseline outcome data, and were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [11.5] years). Both groups demonstrated mean improvement in UDI total score at 6 months with no significant difference between groups (onabotulinumtoxinA: -66.8 points [95% CI, -84.9 to -48.8]; sling: -84.9 [95% CI, -100.5 to -69.3]; mean difference, 18.1 points [95% CI, -4.6 to 40.7]; P = .12). For secondary outcomes, greater UDI stress score improvement was seen with the sling (-45.2 [95% CI, -53.7 to -36.8]) compared with onabotulinumtoxinA (-25.1 [95% CI, -34.1 to -16.1]) (P < .001); however, no significant difference was seen between groups in UDI irritative score (onabotulinumtoxinA: -32.9 [95% CI, -40.3 to -25.6] vs sling: -27.4 [95% CI, -34.6 to -20.3]; P = .27). In the onabotulinumtoxinA group, 12.7% and 28.2% received a second injection by 6 and 12 months, respectively. By 12 months, 30.3% in the sling group received onabotulinumtoxinA, and 15.5% in the onabotulinumtoxinA group received a sling. Overall, adverse events were not different between groups. There was no observed difference in UDI total score improvement at 6 months between the onabotulinumtoxinA and midurethral sling groups in females with moderate to severe mixed urinary incontinence who previously did not respond to conservative treatments. These findings may help inform treatment decisions based on patient preference in partnership with clinician recommendations. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04171531.",

  "abstract": "Health care costs and wait times for colorectal cancer treatment are increasing in Canada, but the association between the 2 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between wait times and health care costs and utilization. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study. This study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014 were sorted and ranked into quintiles based on the time from index contact for a colorectal cancer-related symptom to first treatment. The primary outcome is risk-adjusted health care costs, and the secondary outcomes include health care utilization and overall mortality. We included a total of 6936 patients. Total wait times ranged between 0 and 762 days. In comparison with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly increased costs (short: mean cost ratio 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32; moderate: mean cost ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; long: mean cost ratio 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.64; and very long: mean cost ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Compared with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly lower risk of mortality (short: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; moderate: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80; long: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; very long: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85). The median number of pretreatment radiological and endoscopic investigations and surgeon clinic visits increased over the study period across all wait time categories. This is a nonrandomized, retrospective cohort study with potentially limited generalizability. Patients with very short and short wait times are likely those diagnosed with life-threatening complications of colorectal cancer. Outside this window, patients with longer wait times experience increased health care costs and utilization with similar overall mortality. Improved care coordination and patient navigation may help contain the increasing wait times and associated increasing health care costs and utilization.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the accessibility of telehealth (TH) and forced a trial of incorporating remote care into routine CF care. The CF Learning Network (CFLN) organized for data sharing into a telehealth innovation lab (TH-iLab) to improve access to the interdisciplinary care team and co-produced shared agenda-setting. All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

Of the 649 twin pregnancies (1298 live fetuses) at enrollment, there were 436 (70.6%) DC and 182 (29.4%) MCDA pregnancies. In total, 1168 babies were liveborn to 618 mothers (808 DC and 360 MCDA twins) after excluding cases lost to follow-up and TOPs. Anomalies were identified in 4.1% of the fetuses (48/1168). Of the 48 fetuses with anomalies, 17 (35.4%) were identified in the first, 21 (43.8%) in the second, and 6 (12.5%) in the third trimester. Additional 4 (8.3%) were identified postnatally. Of the anomalies, 37 were in fetuses from DC twins (4.57%), and 11 (3.05%) in MCDA twins. We demonstrate the utility of detailed fetal scans in twin pregnancies in all three trimesters. First- and second-trimester diagnosis enables genetic counseling and testing, and informed parental decisions of pregnancy management. In addition to alerting the parents to the presence of fetal anomalies, third-trimester scans enhanced delivery planning and newborn care.",

  "abstract": "Early detection of postoperative recurrence is beneficial for patients with cancer; however, optimal surveillance remains an issue. To optimize the follow-up plan, the estimation of an individual patient's risk of recurrence is indispensable. This study aimed to establish a statistical model for predicting the risk of organ-specific recurrence after curative resection of colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral hospital. This study included 1720 patients with colon cancer treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical charts. The risk score was developed using a competing risk model in a derivation cohort (973 patients treated in 1997-2009) and then validated in a validation cohort (747 patients treated in 2010-2015). Patients who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon cancer were included. The prediction of the incidence of postoperative liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer was measured. The factors selected for the prediction model for liver metastasis included differentiation, T category, venous invasion, N category, and preoperative CEA level. The model for lung metastasis included sex, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, N category, preoperative CEA level, and malignant bowel obstruction. During external validation, the area under the curve at 60 months was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for liver metastasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.81) for lung metastasis. The generalizability of the model to different healthcare settings remains to be elucidated. We developed a prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence in the liver and lung after curative resection of colon cancer, which demonstrated good discrimination ability in the external validation cohort. Our model can aid clinicians and patients in customizing postoperative surveillance according to an individual patient's risk of organ-specific recurrence.

DESARROLLO Y VALIDACIÓN DE UN MODELO DE PREDICCIÓN PARA RECURRENCIAS ESPECÍFICAS DESPUÉS DE RESECCIÓN CURATIVA DE UN CÁNCER DE COLON: La detección temprana de una recidiva postoperatoria es beneficiosa para los pacientes afectados de cáncer. Sin embargo, la mejor vigilancia sigue siendo un problema. Para optimizar el plan de seguimiento, la estimación del riesgo individual de recurrencia de un paciente es indispensable. Establecer un modelo estadístico para predecir el riesgo de recurrencia en un organo específico luego de la resección curativa de un cáncer de colon. DISEÑO:: Estudio retrospectivo de cohortes en un hospital de referencia terciaria. Este estudio incluyó 1720 pacientes con cáncer de colon tratados en el Hospital de la Universidad de Tokio entre 1997 y 2015. Los datos se recuperaron retrospectivamente de las historias clinicas de los pacientes. La puntuación de riesgo fué desarrollada utilizando un modelo de riesgo competitivo en cohortes de derivación (973 pacientes tratados en 1997-2009) y luego se lo validó en cohortes de validación (747 pacientes tratados en 2010-2015). Todos aquellos casos que se sometieron a una resección curativa de cáncer de colon en estadio I-III RESULTADOS PRINCIPLES:: La predicción de la incidencia de metástasis hepáticas y pulmonares postoperatorias del cáncer de colon. Los factores seleccionados para el modelo de predicción de metástasis hepáticas incluyeron diferenciación tumoral, categoría T, invasión venosa, categoría N y nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio. El modelo de predicción de metástasis pulmonar incluyó el sexo del paciente, la invasión linfática, la invasión venosa, la categoría N, el nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio y la obstrucción intestinal maligna. Durante la validación externa, el área inferior de la curva a 60 meses fue de 0,78 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,71 a 0,84) para las metástasis hepáticas y de 0,72 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,64 a 0,81) para las metástasis pulmonares. La generalización del presente modelo a diferentes entornos de atención en salud aún no ha podido ser dilucidado. Desarrollamos un modelo de predicción para estimar el riesgo de recurrencia en el hígado y el pulmón después de resección curativa de cáncer de colon, éste modelo demostró una buena capacidad de discriminación en las cohortes de validación externa. El modelo puede ayudar a médicos y pacientes a personalizar la vigilancia postoperatoria de acuerdo con el riesgo individual de recurrencia específica en un órgano específico.

  "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that necessitates high-calorie, protein-rich diets, leading to nutritional deficiencies. Food insecurity (FI) poses a significant challenge for people with CF (pwCF), impacting their ability to maintain the necessary dietary intake. This study aims to explore FI and dietary patterns among pwCF in Turkey. A cross-sectional study involving 290 pwCF from the Marmara University Selim Çöremen Cystic Fibrosis Center was conducted between April 2023 and February 2024. The \"US Household Food Security Survey Module\" and the \"Your Current Life Situation\" survey were used to assess FI and socioeconomic status among the participants. Nutritional data, including BMI, FEV1 values, and dietary intake, were recorded. Among the participants, 52.7% were female, with a mean age of 13.3 ± 8.1 years. FI was detected in 46.8% of pwCF, with 18% facing very low food security. Higher income levels were associated with better food security (p = 0.008). Nutritional inadequacies were observed even among food-secure individuals, particularly in the consumption of legumes, nuts, and fish. BMI and BMI percentile values were significantly lower in the very low FS group compared to the high FS group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Ensuring adequate nutrition and calorie intake is crucial for pwCF. Our study highlights significant FI among pwCF in Turkey, with income levels influencing food security status. Nutritional inadequacies persist even among those classified as food secure. Based on these findings, targeted nutritional support will be provided to those in need to improve overall health and well-being.",

  "abstract": "Small infants for gestational age (SGA) and large infants for gestational age (LGA) have increased risk of complications during delivery and later in life. Prediction of the fetal weight is currently limited to biometric parameters obtained by ultrasound scans that can be imprecise. Biomarkers of fetal growth would be crucial for tailoring clinical management and optimizing outcomes for the mother and child. Seventy pregnant women participated in the current study, including 58, 7, and 5 giving birth to adequate for gestational age (AGA), SGA, and LGA infants, respectively. Maternal venous blood was drawn at gestational weeks 12-19, 21-27, and 28-34 and quantified for nearly 5000 proteins on the SomaLogic platform. We used machine learning algorithms with leave-one-out cross-validation to construct multiprotein models for prediction of birth weight groups. Random forest models using only 20 predefined proteins (selected by moderated   tests) were able to predict LGA with good discrimination (AUC > 0.8) at all three visits, while prediction of SGA was less successful. Protein differential abundance analysis revealed 148 proteins with higher abundance in LGA compared to AGA pregnancies, while only four proteins were differentially abundant between the SGA and AGA. The principal findings indicate that the maternal plasma proteome may hold potential biomarkers of LGA.",

  "abstract": "Biopsies are routinely obtained in the workup of large colorectal polyps before endoscopic resection. This study aimed to examine how reliable biopsies are in terms of reflecting the true histopathology of large colorectal polyps, in the clinical routine. This is a retrospective study. Data from patients undergoing polypectomy of large colorectal polyps at the endoscopy unit, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, between January 2014 and December 2016 were scrutinized. A total of 485 colorectal lesions were biopsied within 1 year before complete endoscopic removal. Biopsy-obtained specimens were compared with completely resected specimens in terms of concordance and discordance and if the final result was upgraded or downgraded. The primary outcome measured was the concordance between biopsy-obtained specimens and completely resected specimens. Median lesion size was 3 cm (range 1-11). In 189 cases (39%), biopsies did not provide a correct dysplastic grade compared with final pathology after complete resection. One hundred forty-three cases (29%) and 46 cases (9%) were upgraded and downgraded. The percentage of cases with discordant biopsy results was 40% in cases with 1 biopsy taken and 38% in cases where multiple biopsies had been sampled. Time from biopsy to complete resection did not influence the erroneous outcome of biopsies. Notably, the percentage of discordant biopsy results was 37% and 35% in lesions measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm. However, this percentage increased to 48% in colorectal lesions larger than 4 cm. This study was designed to reflect the clinical routine, the number of biopsies obtained and forceps technique were hence not standardized, which constitutes a limitation. This study demonstrates that cancer-negative forceps biopsies of large colorectal polyps, referred for endoscopic resection, are not reliable. Considering that endoscopic resection of lesions containing superficial cancer is plausible, the clinical value of forceps biopsies in lesions suitable for endoscopic resection is questionable.

El porcentaje de casos con resultados de biopsia discordantes fue del 40% en los casos con una sola biopsia tomada y del 38% en los casos en los que se tomaron múltiples biopsias. El tiempo desde la biopsia hasta la resección completa no influyó en el resultado erróneo de las biopsias. Notablemente, el porcentaje de resultados de biopsia discordantes fue de 37% y 35% en lesiones que midieron 1-2 cm y 2-4 cm, respectivamente. Sin embargo, este porcentaje aumentó a 48% en lesiones colorrectales mayores de 4 cm.

  "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death globally in children aged 0-5 years. Early access to pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in low-resource, pre-hospital settings may result in improved pediatric pneumonia outcomes. However, few data exist regarding their application in such settings. We performed an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to examine use of pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in pre-hospital environments of Malawi. Our model yielded an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for pre-hospital pulse-oximetry use of $35 (USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared to no pulse-oximetry use. One-way sensitivity analysis showed highest sensitivity to the parameter of downstream hospitalization cost. Given that inpatient management is the standard of care for hypoxemic pneumonia, when only pre-hospital costs were considered the result was an ICER of $9.9/DALY averted. Both values were considered cost-effective according to a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold set for 1x the average GDP per capita in Malawi ($588, 2018). When oxygen was analyzed in combination with pulse-oximetry, we found a baseline WTP threshold for pre-hospital oxygen of $71 per patient. For every 1% reduction in total pediatric pneumonia mortality consequent to pre-hospital oxygen use, we determined the recommended WTP allowance for oxygen would increase by approximately $4.53. We conclude that pulse-oximetry is likely cost-effective in low-resource, pre-hospital environments. We acknowledge the need for further research on the effectiveness of pre-hospital oxygen in reducing pediatric pneumonia mortality and suggest ranges of cost and efficacy for which oxygen is likely to be found cost-effective in tandem with pulse-oximetry.",

  "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a non-hormonal vaginal moisturizer in alleviating the clinical symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). This was an observational, single center, open label study in which the investigational product was applied to postmenopausal women (  = 36) with VVA symptoms three times per week for a period of 12 weeks. Patient's perception of vaginal discomfort, sexual function improvement assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), quality of life evaluated with the Cervantes-SF scale, and subject's satisfaction with the treatment were evaluated after 4 and 12 weeks of product use. In addition, vaginal health was evaluated with the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) score and the vaginal pH. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the severity of the most bothersome symptoms from moderate at baseline (mean 2.47 ± 0.55) to mild after 4 weeks (mean 1.33 ± 0.58) and 12 weeks (mean 1.32 ± 0.74,   < 0.0001). VHI scores significantly improved after 4 and 12 weeks compared to baseline (from 11.70 to 16.36 at 4 weeks and 17.34 at 12 weeks, both   < 0.0001). Vaginal pH decreased significantly from a mean pH of 6.27 ± 0.46 at baseline to 5.77 ± 0.59 at 4 weeks and 5.56 ± 0.60 at 12 weeks of treatment (  < 0.0001). Total FSFI scores significantly increased, indicating improvement of sexual function, after 4 and then after 12 weeks of product use (Baseline score 20.16 compared to 24.27 at 4 and 23.94 at 12 weeks, both   < 0.0001). Quality of life improved (decrease of total Cervantes-SF scores) after 12 weeks of product use as compared to baseline (Baseline 32.09 vs 26.45,   = 0.0004). At 12 weeks, a 97.5% reported overall satisfaction with the product and no adverse events related to the product were reported. Through limited size study, the proposed non-hormonal vaginal moisturizer demonstrated being effective and safe for the management of VVA symptoms in postmenopausal women, offering significant improvements in symptom severity, vaginal health, sexual function, and quality of life. There is a need for further research with a larger sample and comparison with other similar products.",

We studied 404 patients, divided into three groups: 75 with CD, 120 DHF and 212 cases with no hemorrhagic data although displaying Dengue with Thrombocytopenia (DwT). General symptoms were much less common among Dengue cases. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were more frequent among patients with DHF. Fluid leakage and hemorrhaging were observed in 75% and 46%, respectively, of the latter group. The history of prior infection was proportional. All patients presenting DHF showed thrombocytopenia, though only 3% showed hemoconcentration. The mean value for hematocrit was low (p=0.02) and the platelet count greater (p<0.001) among Dengue cases. Hemoglobin concentration showed no difference. The average time between disease onset and appearance of thrombocytopenia was similar in DHF cases (4.3+/- 1.6 days) and Dengue with Thrombocytopenia (4.3+/-1.6); even though, contrary to these, in the first group fluid leakage (3.7+/-1.8) and hemorrhaging (3.4+/-1.7) were previously identified. Our results confirm the presence of cases showing atypical disease course, without external hemorrhaging data but showing significant thrombocytopenia that may go unnoticed and worsen disease progression.",

Of 200 consecutively recruited children with a previously proven diagnosis of PBB 62 (12.2 years, female 48%) were interviewed after 7.7 (5.4-14.7) years about their previous and current symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs: spirometry, body plethysmography, nitrogen multi-breath washout, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide) were performed. Children with persistent symptoms were offered lung imaging. 11 (17.7%) patients suffered from chronic or recurring wet cough years after their first PBB episode. 15 (24.19%) had at least one abnormal spirometry parameter. FEV1 was abnormal in eight of 62 (12.9%), LCI 2.5% in seven of 56 (12.5%), FVC in 12 of 62 (19.35%) and FEV1/FVC in five of 62 (8.06%) cases. PFT did not differ between children with and without wet cough. Lung MRI/CT demonstrate in four of nine cases abnormalities of the bronchial walls, including one with incipient bronchiectasis. After PBB in early childhood, a significant proportion of children suffer from respiratory symptoms many years later, some have an objectively reduced lung function and structural changes of the bronchial wall despite adequate initial therapy. Wet cough alone seems not to be a sensitive clinical predictor. Due to the retrospective study design, we cannot proof any causal relationship. However, to detect late bronchopulmonary sequelae, continuous follow-up of these children should become mandatory.",

We evaluated whether baseline binocular CS predicts 30-month functional brain network organization in 172 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 76.4±4.8 years, 56.4% female, 11.6% non-white/Hispanic) that underwent functional MRI (fMRI) at rest and during a motor imagery (MI) task. We constructed separate distance regression models for each of the 8 subnetworks covering the entire brain, while controlling for the baseline brain networks, sex, and the number of volumes removed during motion scrubbing from head motion in the scanner. Worse baseline CS predicted lower community structure integrity at 30-months in the visual network (VN, β=0.0115; p<0.0001), dorsal attention network (DAN, β=0.0075; p=0.0089), and default mode network both at rest (β=0.0173; p<0.0001) and during the MI task (DMN, β=0.0103; p=0.0002). No other networks showed significant associations. The DAN did not have a relationship with CS at baseline but was significant at 30-months. Similar findings were observed in models that additionally controlled for baseline MoCA and change in MoCA score over 30 months. Poor CS may identify a subset of older adults at risk of future decrements in brain circuits important for vision, cognitive and mobility functions. Future studies should explore if improving CS increases functional brain health.",

The full analysis showed non-inferiority of the relaxed treatment, with a mean difference of -0.12 letters (95%-CI: -3.45 to infinity, H0; mean. diff. ≤ 5 letters: p = 0.008), and a visual acuity gain of 7.3 (4.82; 9.78) vs. 7.01 (3.67; 10.36) letters in the strict vs. relaxed regimen, respectively. Many patients deviated from the protocol due to Covid-19. Per-protocol analysis showed a mean difference of -1.78 letters (95%-CI: -6.61 to infinity, H0; mean. diff. ≤ 5 letters: p = 0.136). Fewer injections were needed in the relaxed regimen, with a mean difference of -2.34 (95%-CI: -4.11 to -0.56, p = 0.01). Tolerating up to 100 μm subfoveal subretinal fluid achieves good visual outcomes in our 24-month follow-up period, in patients treated with aflibercept for nAMD, with significantly fewer injections needed.",

Animals with LIM of Groups III (n = 15), IV (n = 15) and V (n = 15) received three 4-weekly intravitreal injections of panitumumab at doses of 25, 50 and 100 μg, respectively, into their right eyes, and of phosphate-buffered saline into their left eyes. Inter-eye differences in axial elongation (right eye minus left eye at study end) decreased (p < 0.001) from 0.00 ± 0.02 mm (Group I) and - 0.01 ± 0.02 mm (Group II) to -0.09 ± 0.03 mm (Group III), -0.12 ± 0.03 mm (Group IV) and - 0.17 ± 0.05 mm (Group V). Interocular choroidal thickness differences (measured by optical coherence tomography) increased (p < 0.01) from Groups I and II to Groups III-V. Western blot analysis showed an increase (p < 0.05) in expression levels of EGFR and its downstream phosphorylated signalling molecule, p-PI3K, in Group II compared to Group I and a decrease in Groups III-V compared to Group II (all p < 0.01). Interocular differences in retinal thickness did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the groups. TUNEL staining revealed no significant differences in retinal apoptotic cell density among any groups (all p > 0.05). Intravitreally administered panitumumab in young guinea pigs with LIM resulted in a dose-dependent and treatment frequency-dependent reduction in axial elongation, supporting the role of EGFR signalling in axial elongation.",

  "abstract": "Inflammation is a key mechanism underlying age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, the specific circulating inflammatory proteins involved remain unclear. This study investigated the causal relationship between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and AMD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. We conducted a two-sample magnetic resonance imaging MR analysis using genomewide association study (GWAS) data. Five MR methodologies were applied, with inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the primary approach. We applied false discovery rate (FDR) correction to mitigate false positives. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Additionally, Steiger's test, reverse MR analysis, and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) were used to validate the results. Five inflammatory proteins demonstrated significant associations with overall AMD, including three associated with wet AMD and one associated with dry AMD. LDSC analysis indicated that, except for fibroblast growth factor-19, no genetic correlation confounded the causal relationships. Additionally, the expression of the identified proteins was unaffected by the genetic prediction of AMD. This study highlights the causal relationship between specific inflammatory proteins and AMD, emphasizing their potential roles in AMD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.",

  "abstract": "Pancreatic surgery, associated with technical difficulties and high complication rates, remains a challenge for surgeons. The laparoscopic approach has been shown to have benefits over the open approach; however laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) still has its challenges. Robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) offers a technical edge over the laparoscopic approach in terms of superior imaging and ergonomics. Whether the technical advantages translate into improved outcomes is to be established. The aim of this study was to produce an overview of systematic reviews, summarising the evidence to date comparing RDP and LDP in terms of intraoperative, postoperative, and oncological outcomes and assessing the quality of the included reviews. Three electronic databases, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, were searched to identify systematic reviews with meta-analyses comparing RDP with LDP. The AMSTAR-2 format was used to assess the quality of the studies. Fourteen systematic reviews were identified for inclusion. RDP had a significantly higher rate of spleen preservation, significantly shorter hospital stay, and a significantly lower rate of conversion to open surgery, whilst having higher total costs compared to LDP. The overall quality of the reviews was variable. The evidence suggests that RDP has potential advantages over LDP in terms of higher spleen preservation rate, shorter hospital stays, and lower conversion rate to open surgery, whilst maintaining comparability with most other outcomes. Based on the variable quality evidence, RDP is a safe alternative to LDP. Key Words: Pancreatectomy, Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, Robotic surgery, Outcome.",

Existing therapies mostly target symptoms, rather than addressing the underlying causes of the disease, leaving a burden of unmet clinical needs. Emerging evidence suggests a significant role for the gut microbiota and associated immune responses in influencing brain development and function, changing the paradigm of a brain-centric origin of NDDs. This review discusses the pivotal interactions within the gut-immune-brain axis, highlighting how microbial dysbiosis and immune signaling contribute to neurological pathologies. We also explore the potential of microbial management and immunomodulation as novel therapeutic avenues, emphasizing the need for a shift towards addressing the root causes of these disorders rather than just their symptoms.

In this study, we assessed the gut microbiota in 50 genetically confirmed DMD patients (median age 13.1 years) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Cognitive assessment was performed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales, with ID defined as an IQ < 70. Stool samples were analyzed, and statistical methods were used to assess alpha- and beta-diversity. Thirty-four percent of patients had ID. No significant differences were found in alpha-diversity or in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. However, beta-diversity analysis revealed significant differences between DMD + and DMD - groups, including, in DMD + , an increased abundance of Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and a reduction in Bulleidia. These bacteria are involved in metabolic pathways that can influence neurological health through the gut-brain axis, particularly via the production of short-chain fatty acids. While these preliminary findings suggest a possible association between gut microbiota profile and cognitive impairment in DMD, further research is needed to explore a causal relationship and consider microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies.",

This includes the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, toxicity, impact on adipose tissue, and how this tissue becomes metabolically dysfunctional, contributing to the emergence of insulin resistance and other comorbidities in PLWH. Considering the impact of the modern obesogenic environment and that PLWH on INsTI-ART are living longer, a coordinated approach by infectious disease specialists and other physicians to address the metabolic complications affecting this population, is imperative. The use of new anti-obesity drugs is becoming part of co-medication to limit weight gain in this population.",

This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study included chronic hepatitis C patients <18 years old evaluated by pediatric hepatologists at an academic health system between 1/1/2017 and 9/30/2022. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) ≥12 weeks following treatment completion in patients initiating DAAs. Secondary endpoints were CoC advancement, variables impacting DAA initiation, patient-reported side effects, and adherence. An ordinal logistic regression model assessed whether initiation time was associated with a patient's ability to swallow, prior authorization outcome, and medication availability to HSSP at referral. The odds ratio reflects the likelihood of a shift in time to initiation for a given group relative to its respective reference group. Of 98 patients evaluated by a hepatologist, 73 (75%) were referred to the HSSP. Loss to follow-up was the primary reason (88%; 22/25) for non-referral, most commonly (73%; 16/22) in those aged ≤5 years. Following HSSP referral, 88% (64/73) initiated DAA and 92% (59/64) of those achieved SVR. Time from HSSP referral to medication initiation was impacted by DAA availability [OR=41.47; 95% CI: 9.51, 180.87; p<0.001] and inability to swallow the dosage form at evaluation [OR=3.94; 95% CI: 1.56, 9.98; p=0.004]. Over half (53%; 34/64) of patients initiating DAA reported ≥1 adverse event; none discontinued treatment. Most (69%; 44/64) reported no missed doses. The largest CoC drop-off occurred following initial clinic evaluation, primarily in children ≤5 years. Enhanced linkage to care efforts are needed in these patients. Conversely, nearly all patients referred to the HSSP were initiated on DAA, completed therapy, and achieved SVR.",

Moreover, delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation for children living with HIV may aggravate outcomes. We used a survey study administered to Brazilian maternities to evaluate compliance with individual PTHIV prevention interventions as well as the overall compliance using a combined endpoint. We also investigated associations with the average number of births per month and municipal social vulnerability index (SVI) using regression models. Next, using data from Brazilian HIV monitoring systems, we obtained information on age at first HIV viral load (VL) testing and age at first antiretroviral dispensation to evaluate delayed diagnosis (first VL testing ≥6 months) and delayed antiretroviral initiation (first dispensation ≥12 months) among children living with HIV, investigating associations with race/ethnicity, sex and SVI. Of 801 maternities, only 21% were compliant with the combined endpoint. Facilities located in cities with higher SVI and those with a lower number of births per month had lower odds of being compliant. Among 1152 children living with HIV, the median age at first HIV VL testing was 3 months (range 0-18) and 24% had a delayed diagnosis. Children living with HIV in cities with higher SVI had higher odds of delayed diagnosis. The median age at antiretroviral initiation was 6 months (range 1-120), and those with a delayed diagnosis had higher odds of delayed treatment initiation (aOR 4.9, 95% CI 3.5-9.9). Our study reveals significant challenges in access to PTHIV prevention, timely diagnosis and timely treatment initiation for children living with HIV, potentially related to social determinants.",

  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder in the world. Most patients with MASLD are undiagnosed, untreated and unreferred. Treatment depends on diagnosis and accurate staging of fibrosis risk, and therefore screening at the primary care setting coupled with consistent, timely, evidence-based, widely accessible, and testable management processes is critical. Randomized controlled trials of methods for screening, diagnosis, severity stratification, and referral are lacking. We previously validated the MASLD clinical care pathway (MCCP), a multistep algorithmic process geared to support primary care settings in screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and suggested referral and treatment of patients with MASLD. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the MCCP intervention compared to usual care in improving MASLD care process and patient outcomes. A two-arm, parallel, cluster-randomized trial will assess the effect of the MCCP intervention comprised of an e-trigger and structured provider education on screening, diagnosis, referral, and treatment for MASLD. Clusters are Veterans Affairs (VA) patient-centered primary care clinics, called Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). This 4-year study will include three phases: (1) formative assessment to explore barriers to feasibility and acceptability of intervention among providers and patients and adapt MCCP for utilization by VA PACTs, (2) cluster-randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of the MCCP compared to usual care, and (3) summative evaluation to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with effectiveness of MCCP and plan for future implementation. The primary outcome will be a composite dichotomous variable for making a new MASLD diagnosis and completing severity risk stratification of MASLD. Secondary outcomes include referral and receipt of hepatology specialty care for patients with MASLD and advanced fibrosis. Our randomized controlled trial will be the first to systematically implement the MCCP using strategies that are clinically relevant, adaptable and scalable. If successful, the MCCP will improve outcomes for patients with MASLD through early detection, accurate risk stratification, and timely treatment within primary care settings. This trial has been registered on clinicaltrails.gov (# NCT06671886), registration date: 10-31-2024.",

Identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor initiation and ocular inflammatory attack frequency, is critical for improving management. This study aimed to identify biomarkers predicting the clinical course of BD using peripheral blood test data and unbiased clustering combined with machine learning. A retrospective cohort study of 238 BD patients diagnosed at Tokyo Medical University Hospital (2004-2020) was conducted. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied to peripheral blood data, dividing patients into distinct groups. Machine learning techniques were used to explore biomarkers predicting the clinical course. Cluster analysis identified four groups: Group A (low C-reactive protein), Group B (high angiotensin-converting enzyme), Group C (high anti-streptolysin O), and Group D (low neutrophil count). Group C had a higher rate of TNF inhibitor initiation (47%, p = 0.04), while Group D had fewer ocular inflammation attacks per year (1.4, p = 0.04). Logistic regression analysis identified red blood cell count (p < 0.01) and monocyte percentage (p = 0.02) as predictive biomarkers for TNF inhibitor initiation. Machine learning further confirmed mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) as a significant predictor of TNF inhibitor initiation. Additionally, multiple regression analysis identified the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of the number of inflammatory attacks per year (p = 0.02). Unsupervised clustering of blood test data identified distinct BD clinical phenotypes. Monocyte percentage may predict TNF inhibitor initiation, while neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio may predict ocular inflammation frequency, highlighting pathophysiologic heterogeneity in BD.",

  "abstract": "Influenza poses a significant medical burden and has the potential to cause global pandemics. To better understand the epidemiological characteristics of influenza reinfections and identify factors associated with an increased risk of reinfection, we analyzed influenza data from 2010 to 2023 obtained from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System in Chongqing, China. The Andersen-Gill model was used to evaluate the association between demographic characteristics and the risk of reinfection. A total of 676,811.47 person-years were observed, with a median time to reinfection of 9.40 months. The log-rank test revealed significant differences in reinfection probability by sex, age, occupation, and residence (  < .001). Independent risk factors for influenza reinfection included male sex (adjusted hazard ratio [a ]: 1.026, 95% confidence interval [ ]: 1.004-1.049), age ≤ 5 years (aH : 4.645, 95%  : 4.292-5.027), 6-18 years (a : 3.891, 95%  : 3.574-4.235), age 46-64 years (a : 1.336, 95%  : 1.158-1.541), and age ≥ 65 years (a : 2.946, 95%  : 2.533-3.426), urban residency (a : 1.353, 95%  : 1.315-1.391), and preschool-aged children (a : 2.103, 95%  : 1.830-2.416). Influenza reinfection in Chongqing is relatively common and significantly associated with several key factors, including male sex, age ≤ 18 or > 45 years, preschool-aged children, and urban residency. These findings underscore the importance of tailored public health strategies, particularly promoting influenza vaccination among at-risk groups, to protect vulnerable populations from reinfection.

  "abstract": "Globally, chronic respiratory diseases have become the third leading cause of death, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and have been threatening human life for a long time. To alleviate the disease burden, it is crucial to develop rapid and convenient screening methods for COPD, preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm), and asthma. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath can reflect the pathophysiological processes of disease, thereby having the potential to serve as a promising approach for diagnosing respiratory diseases. Can we identify VOC markers in breath with the potential to serve as classification indicators, and further establish learning models for the early detection of COPD, asthma, or PRISm patients? This is a cross-sectional study in which exhaled breath samples were collected from 184 patients with COPD, 66 patients with asthma, 72 PRISm individuals, and 45 healthy individuals. From August 2023 to June 2024, the breath samples were analyzed using portable micro gas chromatography (CXBA-Alpha, ChromX Health Co., Ltd.). Potential VOC markers for classification were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. Subsequently, classification models were established by machine learning algorithms, based on these VOC markers along with baseline characteristics. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these models were calculated to assess their overall discriminatory performance. A total of 367 patients were enrolled in our study. We identified nine VOCs distinguishing COPD patients from healthy controls, nine VOCs differentiating the PRISm population from healthy controls, five VOCs separating asthma patients from healthy controls, five VOCs distinguishing COPD patients from asthma patients, and seven VOCs differentiating the PRISm population from asthma patients based on breathomics feature selection. We utilized five algorithms to establish diagnostic models and selected the optimal one among them. The random forest model best distinguished COPD from healthy controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 ± 0.01. The support vector classifier (SVC) model was most effective in separating PRISm from healthy controls, achieving an AUC of 0.78 ± 0.01. Logistic regression performed well in discriminating asthma from PRISm (AUC, 0.74 ± 0.02) and COPD (AUC, 0.92 ± 0.01), in contrast, the random forest model differentiated asthma from healthy controls with an AUC of 0.81 ± 0.02. VOC panel-based classification models have the potential to be a novel strategy for the discrimination of chronic respiratory diseases. Using the portal micro gas chromatography enables swift detection of chronic respiratory disease and, most importantly, facilitates the rapid identification of PRISm individuals within the population.",

  "abstract": "Patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have poor prognosis. Current cisplatin-based first-line chemotherapy offers limited survival benefits. Cisplatin induces single-strand DNA breaks, activating DNA repair mechanisms that diminish its effectiveness. Here, we present the design, chemical synthesis, and therapeutic evaluation of a new generation of chemotherapeutic agents (Aurkines) with unique polyelectrophilic properties. These agents cause a high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks, bypassing DNA repair, and promoting cancer cell death. Two novel compounds, Aurkine 16 and Aurkine 18, were designed and evaluated for their antitumor effects in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant CCA cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), healthy cholangiocytes, and in vivo models. Aurkines effectively induced double-strand DNA breaks, leading to increased DNA damage and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin in CCA cells. Phosphoproteomic and molecular analysis revealed that cisplatin activates DNA repair pathways, while Aurkines primarily induce apoptosis. Importantly, Aurkines also triggered apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant CCA cells and CAFs without harming healthy cholangiocytes. Additionally, Aurkines demonstrated cytotoxicity in other cisplatin-resistant cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. This tumor selectivity results from reduced uptake, increased efflux, and compact chromatin structure in normal cells, limiting Aurkine-DNA interactions. In vivo, Aurkines inhibited the growth of subcutaneous naïve and cisplatin-resistant CCA tumors, as well as orthotopic tumors in immunocompetent mice promoting antitumor immune cell recruitment, without any adverse events. Transport studies revealed that Aurkines were selectively taken up by OCT1, OCT3, CTR1, and OATP1A2, whereas only CTR1 transported cisplatin. Aurkines represent promising therapeutic drugs for both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancers due to their unique polyelectrophilic properties and selective targeting of malignant cells. This study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy designed to induce frequent double-strand DNA breaks selectively in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, without evident toxic side effects at therapeutic doses. This approach may settle the basis for new strategies to overcome the critical challenge of drug resistance in cancer treatment, and has the potential to be a breakthrough not only for the treatment of biliary tumors but also for other cancers.",

  "abstract": "The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) experienced with low-level viremia (LLV) remains poorly defined. This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic utility of serum HBV RNA as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in this population. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 117 pediatric patients with LLV (mean age: 13.14 years; 34% female) treated with continuous entecavir (ConT) or modified regimens (switching to or combining with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for ≥ 120 weeks. Virological response was defined as HBV DNA < 10 IU/mL at week 120. No significant baseline differences existed between ConT and modified regimen groups. Compared to ConT, modified regimens achieved greater reductions in serum HBV DNA, HBV RNA, and quantitative HBsAg, with higher cumulative undetectable rates at week 120 (HBV DNA: ≥ 80.0%; HBV RNA: ≥ 54.8%; P < 0.05). Notably, qHBsAg levels remained elevated in most patients, with only 3 individuals achieving undetectable levels (< 0.05 IU/mL). Multivariate analysis identified higher HBV RNA levels at week 48 as an independent risk factor for non-virological response (adjusted odds ratio: 5.86; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-24.62; P = 0.016). Although HBV RNA alone was less predictive than HBV DNA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.76 vs. 0.80; P = 0.459), combining both markers improved prediction accuracy (AUC: 0.82; P < 0.05 vs. single markers). In children with LLV, serum HBV RNA level is an independent risk factor for non-virological response and may serve as a complementary biomarker to HBV DNA for guiding antiviral therapy adjustments.",

  "abstract": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major global public health problem, associated with infertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and significant social and economic burdens. These challenges are particularly severe in underprivileged communities. A 2024 World Health Organisation report highlighted a global surge in STIs, requiring intensified efforts to improve their control and management. In order to appropriately respond and reverse the status quo, it is important to understand the extent to which the current interventions have reached the beneficiaries. This study aimed to assess the coverage of sexually transmitted infection (STI) services using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) approach in eight districts of Central Uganda. A household survey was conducted in eight districts, targeting four population groups: mothers of children aged 0-11 months, women aged 15-49 years, men aged 15 + years, and youth aged 15-25 years. LQAS was used, with each district stratified into five supervision areas (SAs). In each SA, 19 respondents were randomly sampled from each target group. The survey assessed key indicators related to STIs, including knowledge of STI symptoms, knowledge of actions to take when infected with an STI, and engagement in risky sexual behavior. The study also examined condom use during risky sex, circumcision acceptance and non-acceptance among men, including reasons for its acceptance or non-acceptance. Overall and district-specific coverage was calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Indicator coverage in the SAs was classified using LQAS decision rules (DRs) for each indicator, using the overall coverage as benchmark for setting the DR. The findings revealed that mothers of children aged 0-11 months demonstrated superior knowledge of STIs and appropriate actions to take if one has an STI. Men (15 + years) and youth (15-24 years) reported engaging more in risky sexual behavior compared to women 15-49 years and mothers of children aged 0-11 months. Relatedly, men 15 + years reported higher condom use during risky intercourse. Youth were more likely to be circumcised than older men. Coverage for most indicators varied across SAs and districts. However, one in forty of the SAs fell short of average coverage in all the indicators. Personal hygiene was the leading motivator for circumcision acceptance while fear of pain was the leading driver for refusal to accept being circumcised. The findings highlight vital disparities in STI knowledge and risky sexual behavior among different demographic groups. These findings inform public health strategies to address STI disparities and improve reproductive health outcomes. District and SA-specific bottleneck analysis is recommended in order to provide actionable solutions to improve low-indicator coverage in low-coverage districts and SAs.",

Patients with ADC who underwent NACT or NACRT and surgery between 2015 and 2020 were included. The correlation between pTR and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after both treatments was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. pTR was assessed by using the Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG). Overall, 563 patients were included; 278 received NACT, and 285 NACRT. The incidence of pCR was significantly higher after NACRT (24.6% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.0001). The TRG of both node-negative (pN0) and node-positive (pN+) patients significantly correlated with the 5 years OS after NACT (pN0 p = 0.03, pN+ p = 0.01). The same result was not detected in NACRT patients (pN0 p = 0.98, pN+ p = 0.23). The 5-year DFS of the patients with pCR was higher in the NACT group (84% vs. 66.5%, p = 0.05). The proportion of patients showing distant recurrences was significantly higher in the NACRT group (35.4% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.009). Tumor regression grade was significantly associated with survival after NACT, but not with NACRT.

  "abstract": "In the Netherlands, the annual expenditure on HIV care was reported as €202 million in 2019, with about 70% allocated to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The introduction of generic antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in 2017 has offered potential cost-saving opportunities in healthcare. Understanding the financial implications of incorporating generic ART into the Dutch healthcare system is crucial to determine its impact. We used data from the Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics (SFK), covering 98% of all community and outpatient clinic pharmacies across the Netherlands. This dataset contained medication information from 2016 to 2022. Medication data were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification with Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) system. Cost analysis was based on Dutch drug prices ( www.medicijnkosten.nl ) for a specified period, and the data were processed using IBM SPSS. In the Netherlands, people with HIV receiving ART increased from 20,072 to 24,573 between 2016 and 2022. HIV medication expenditure was €190 million euros in 2016, with generic medication at 6% DDDs. After an increase in 2017, a subsequent decrease in total HIV medication expenditure led to an overall cost of €181 million in 2022 (-5.1% compared to 2016). Simultaneously, the proportion of DDDs dispensed as a generic increased to 16-32% over the years. This could be linked to 97% compliance with generic substitutions for ARVs where a generic equivalent was available. Notably, the cost per patient per year has declined from €9,488 in 2016 to €7,352 in 2022 (-22.5% compared to 2016). Some of the potential cost-savings through generic substitution were not utilized because of the 20% point increase in the use of novel branded single-tablet regimens (STRs). Our analysis showed high compliance with generic substitution of ARVs in the Netherlands. The increased use of generic ARVs was accompanied by an almost 10% reduction in overall expenditure on ART despite a significant increase in the number of patients in care in the Netherlands during this period. A significant contributing factor to ART costs appears to be the high percentage of prescribed patented Single-Tablet Regimens (STRs). These findings underscore the complex dynamics of pharmaceutical expenditures in the Dutch healthcare system.",

Advances in drug therapy and surgical treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have improved patient outcomes; however, it remains a typical intractable cancer with a poor prognosis. ICC is one of the key tumors for which effective treatment may be identified through CGP testing. This study aimed to identify ICC harboring actionable genetic variants using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US). We enrolled 26 ICC patients who underwent CE-US before chemotherapy or surgery. Three ultrasound specialists reviewed the images by consensus and assessed the imaging features, including vascularity. Pathological data were reviewed after diagnosis using CE-US. We retrospectively analyzed distinctive CE-US findings in patients with ICC with actionable genetic variants. Twelve ICC patients had actionable gene variants, including four FGFR2 fusions, one FGFR2 rearrangement, six IDH1 mutations, and one BRAF V600E mutation. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in bile duct invasion (p = 0.0217) and blood vessel penetration within the tumor (p = 0.0012). Multivariable logistic regression identified blood vessel penetration within the tumor (OR = 18.275; 95% CI: 1.331-250.925; p = 0.0297) as independently associated with actionable gene variants. Patients with ICC and blood vessel penetration on CE-US should be considered for CGP testing.",

All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

We constructed separate distance regression models for each of the 8 subnetworks covering the entire brain, while controlling for the baseline brain networks, sex, and the number of volumes removed during motion scrubbing from head motion in the scanner. Worse baseline CS predicted lower community structure integrity at 30-months in the visual network (VN, β=0.0115; p<0.0001), dorsal attention network (DAN, β=0.0075; p=0.0089), and default mode network both at rest (β=0.0173; p<0.0001) and during the MI task (DMN, β=0.0103; p=0.0002). No other networks showed significant associations. The DAN did not have a relationship with CS at baseline but was significant at 30-months. Similar findings were observed in models that additionally controlled for baseline MoCA and change in MoCA score over 30 months. Poor CS may identify a subset of older adults at risk of future decrements in brain circuits important for vision, cognitive and mobility functions.

  "abstract": "Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is absent from global public health agendas. Our study is the first to comprehensively examine SLD prevalence in Canada, focusing on sex differences. We used data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging between 2012 and 2018. Steatosis was identified using the validated NAFLD Ridge Score. Using the most recent diagnostic criteria, we defined metabolic (dysfunction)-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), metabolic dysfunction-associated alcohol-associated liver disease (MetALD), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and estimated prevalences by sociodemographic factors. Survey-weighted adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for MASLD (sex-stratified) and MetALD were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. A total of 24,888 people (51.4% female; median age 58 years) were included. The most common subtype of SLD was MASLD, 35% (95%CI, 34-36), followed by MetALD 2.6% (2.3-2.9), and ALD 0.8% (0.6-1.0). Overall, the prevalences for MASLD and MetALD were significantly higher among males at 46% (45-48) and 3.7% (3.2-4.2) compared to females at 24% (23-26) and 1.6% (1.2‒2.1), respectively. Lower household incomes were associated with higher MASLD prevalence in females (aPR, 2.9, 2.4-3.5) and males (aPR, 1.1, 1.0-1.3). Multimorbidity was high among the MASLD group; 31 unique MASLD phenotypes based on cardiometabolic characteristics were identified. Females with MASLD were also more likely to have more cardiometabolic conditions compared to males with MASLD. In this large Canadian cohort, we found significant sex differences in SLD burden and cardiometabolic features. Epidemiological assessments are necessary to improve preparedness for the significant projected increase in advanced liver disease. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La stéatose hépatique (SH) est absente des plans d’action mondiaux pour la santé publique. Notre étude est la première à examiner en profondeur sa prévalence au Canada en mettant l’accent sur les différences entre les sexes. MéTHODE: Nous avons utilisé les données de 2012 à 2018 de l’Étude longitudinale canadienne sur le vieillissement (ÉLCV). La stéatose a été identifiée à l’aide de l’outil NAFLD Ridge Score validé. En utilisant les critères de diagnostic les plus récents, nous avons défini la maladie stéatosique du foie liée à une dysfonction métabolique (MASLD), la MASLD avec consommation accrue d’alcool (MetALD) et la maladie hépatique associée à l’alcool (ALD) et nous en avons estimé les prévalences en fonction de facteurs sociodémographiques. Des ratios de prévalence ajustés (RPa) avec des poids de sondage pour la MASLD (stratifiés par sexe) et pour la MetALD ont été estimés à l’aide d’une régression de Poisson avec des erreur-types robustes. RéSULTATS: Au total, 24,888 personnes (51,4% de femmes; âge médian de 58 ans) ont été incluses. Le sous-type le plus courant de SH était la MASLD, avec 35% (IC de 95%: 34–36), suivi de la MetALD, avec 2,6% (2,3–2,9), et de l’ALD, avec 0,8% (0,6–1,0). Dans l’ensemble, les prévalences de la MASLD et de la MetALD étaient sensiblement plus élevées chez les hommes, à 46% (45–48) et 3,7% (3,2–4,2), que chez les femmes, à 24% (23–26) et 1,6% (1,2‒2,1), respectivement. Le faible revenu du ménage était associé à une prévalence plus élevée de la MASLD, tant chez les femmes (RPa: 2,9, 2,4–3,5) que chez les hommes (RPa: 1,1, 1,0–1,3). La multimorbidité était élevée dans le groupe de la MASLD; 31 phénotypes uniques de MASLD basés sur les caractéristiques cardiométaboliques ont été identifiés. Les femmes atteintes de MASLD étaient aussi plus susceptibles de présenter des troubles cardiométaboliques que les hommes atteints de MASLD. CONCLUSION: Dans cette grande cohorte canadienne, nous avons trouvé des différences significatives entre les sexes pour ce qui est de la charge de morbidité de la SH et des caractéristiques cardiométaboliques.

  "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is an effective strategy for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it can also exacerbate lung injury, leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). To investigate the protective role of interleukin-37 (IL-37) in the pathogenesis of VILI, we used two approaches, human IL-37 transgenic (IL37tg) mice and administration of recombinant human IL-37 (rIL37) in wild-type (WT) mice subjected to mechanical ventilation. Lung histopathology was evaluated, inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) were measured, and inflammasome activation was assessed by analyzing NLRP3 and Caspase-1 expression. As a result, IL37tg mice exhibited significantly attenuated lung injury compared to WT controls, characterized by improved histological morphology, reduced lung injury scores, and decreased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Similarly, rIL37 administration markedly reduced lung injury and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of the alveolar cell marker surfactant protein D (SP-D) and IL-37. Furthermore, IL-37 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by reduced NLRP3 and Cleaved-Caspase-1 levels in both the IL37tg mouse model and the rIL37 treatment group. These findings suggest that IL-37 effectively protects against VILI by inhibiting inflammation in lung tissues through inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, IL-37 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of VILI in the future.",

  "abstract": "Caspases are critical regulators of cell death, development, innate immunity, host defense, and disease. Upon detection of pathogens, damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, or other homeostatic disruptions, innate immune sensors, such as NLRs, activate caspases to initiate distinct regulated cell death pathways, including non-lytic (apoptosis) and innate immune lytic (pyroptosis and PANoptosis) pathways. These cell death pathways are driven by specific caspases and distinguished by their unique molecular mechanisms, supramolecular complexes, and enzymatic properties. Traditionally, caspases are classified as either apoptotic (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10) or inflammatory (caspase-1, -4, -5, and -11). However, extensive data from the past decades have shown that apoptotic caspases can also drive lytic inflammatory cell death downstream of innate immune sensing and inflammatory responses, such as in the case of caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8. Therefore, more inclusive classification systems based on function, substrate specificity, or the presence of pro-domains have been proposed to better reflect the multifaceted roles of caspases. In this review, we categorize caspases into CARD-, DED-, and short/no pro-domain-containing groups and examine their critical functions in innate immunity and cell death, along with their structural and molecular mechanisms, including active site/exosite properties and substrates. Additionally, we highlight the emerging roles of caspases in cellular homeostasis and therapeutic targeting. Given the clinical relevance of caspases across multiple diseases, improved understanding of these proteins and their structure-function relationships is critical for developing effective treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Interleukin-23 (IL-23), a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, plays a critical role in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therapies targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23 have recently expanded the therapeutic options for IBD demonstrating efficacy and safety for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). Thus, in this review, we provide an overview of agents targeting the IL-23 pathway in CD, highlighting similarities and differences of specific IL-23 inhibitors. Furthermore, we summarize key phase 3 trials and head-to-head trials, focusing on design features and interpretation. Finally, we discuss the positioning of selective IL-23 agents for CD treatment along with areas of unmet clinical needs. However, real-world data will offer additional comparative effectiveness information, data for disease subtypes, and insights into the long-term outcomes of IL-23 inhibition. Looking ahead, ongoing phase 3 studies testing p19-specific selective IL-23 inhibitors are expected to expand the therapeutic options for patients with complex phenotypes, including those with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), fistulas, and strictures. Advances in molecular and cellular characterization, including the development of predictive molecular biomarkers, may help guide clinical decision-making, enabling more personalized treatment approaches. Precision medicine studies may further enhance our understanding of the molecular biology of IL-23, shedding light on how these agents work in complex CD and clarify their potential complementary or synergistic effects with other therapies.",

  "abstract": "Esophageal stricture is the principal complication associated with endoscopic resection (ER) in patients with superficial esophageal cancer (SEC), and medical intervention may be required to prevent esophageal stricture after ER. The aim of this study was to compare acellular dermal matrix (ADM) transplantation and esophageal mucosal autograft (EMA) transplantation in terms of efficacy in preventing esophageal stricture after ER for SEC. Between May 2017 and November 2022, 48 patients with SEC who underwent EMA or ADM after ER were enrolled in this study. The primary outcomes measured included esophageal stricture, refractory esophageal stricture, and the number of endoscopic dilations after esophageal stricture. A total of 48 patients with SEC were enrolled in this study, 17 of whom underwent EMA after ER (EMA group) and 31 of whom underwent ADM after ER (ADM group). The median of total procedure duration and the median of transplantation duration in the ADM group was significantly shorter than that in the EMA group (Z = - 2.408, P = 0.016; Z = - 2.710, P = 0.006). During the follow-up, 4 patients developed refractory esophageal stricture in the EMA group and 1 developed refractory esophageal stricture in the ADM group. The rate of refractory esophageal stricture was lower in ADM group than in EMA group (3.2% vs. 23.5%, P = 0.047). In patients with > 3/4 circumferential range ER, the rate of refractory esophageal stricture was also lower in ADM group than in EMA group (4.0% vs. 25.0%, P = 0.067). Among the patients who developed esophageal stricture, the median number of endoscopic dilations in the ADM group was less than that in the EMA group (Z = 27.500; P = 0.040). Compared with EMA, ADM provided several advantages, as it reduced the number of endoscopic dilations for patients with esophageal strictures and shortened the procedure duration for patients who underwent esophageal ESD.",

  "abstract": "The mechanism of the lipid paradox remains uncertain, and malnutrition may be 1 explanation. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the associations between baseline remnant cholesterol (RC) concentrations and clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke, stratified by nutritional status. Patients with ischemic stroke in a single-center prospective cohort (Shanghai, China) from January 2018 to December 2022 were studied. Individuals were classified into 3 groups based on their Controlling Nutritional Status score. Poor outcome and all-cause mortality during up to 3 months of follow-up were compared among patients with varied nutritional status and RC levels utilizing multivariate logistic regression analyses, RC splines, and subgroup analyses. A total of 6892 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the cohort, of which 5257 patients were included in the present study (without malnutrition: 2418 [46.0%]; mild malnutrition: 2516 [47.9%]; moderate-severe malnutrition: 323 [6.1%]). The median age was 69±12 years, and 3398 (64.6%) were male. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition had the highest risks of poor outcome (198 [61.3%];  <0.001) and all-cause mortality (106 [32.8%];  <0.001) during the 3-month follow-up. A higher baseline RC level was an independent protective factor for adverse outcomes in patients with any degree of malnutrition ( <0.05), which was not observed in patients without malnutrition. In addition, compared with the moderate-severely malnourished with RC <0.471 mmol/L, the adjusted odds ratios for poor outcome and all-cause mortality were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.450-1.438) and 0.898 (0.502-1.607) for participants with 0.471 to 0.632 mmol/L, 0.259 (0.095-0.704) and 0.222 (0.061-0.810) for 0.633 to 0.868 mmol/L, and 0.160 (0.037-0.689) and 0.202 (0.042-0.967) for ≥0.869 mmol/L, respectively. The lipid paradox was only observed in the malnourished patients with ischemic stroke. Strict lipid reduction therapy is still recommended for patients without malnutrition. However, when treating patients at any risk of malnutrition, the improvement of nutritional status may be more crucial.",

It is in senescence, survival, and growth under normal physiological and pathological conditions, including neoplasms. Additionally, this pathway has been recognized as essential for the regulation of the cell cycle. Several previous studies have indicated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can be influenced by various natural products, with resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) being a particularly important phytoalexin polyphenol in this context. This review explores the impact of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on the initiation and advancement of various cancerous conditions and the potential of resveratrol to target this signaling mechanism. The review begins by summarizing the anti-tumor capabilities of resveratrol and then emphasizes the significant role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the progression of multiple malignancies.

Au@Pt NRs were induced to be assembled on the surface of Au NPAs by CHA technique when the target was present. The sensing system catalyzed the TMB to generate oxidized TMB (oxTMB) with strong SERS signals, and the SERS signals were further amplified by CHA. The sensing system demonstrated excellent analytical performance, achieving ultrasensitive detection of miR-196b and miR-221, tumor markers of gastric precancerous lesions, with detection limit as low as aM level. It also had the capability of simultaneous dual-target detection, which had shown satisfactory clinical utility and accuracy in the detection of actual serum samples. Introducing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of sensing system in detecting precancerous lesions of gastric cancer, the area under the curve (AUC) values for target combination diagnosis were 0.954 and 0.957, respectively. Therefore, the proposed dual function sensing system has broad application prospects in the clinical detection of precancerous lesions of gastric cancer.",

However, due to their impact on extra-cerebral acetylcholine signaling, concerns about cardiac adverse effects, including QT interval prolongation, persist. Despite this, evidence-based guidelines for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring during ChEI treatment are lacking, and prior studies on ChEIs and corrected QT intervals (QTc) yield inconsistent findings. This study aimed to investigate the association between ChEI use and changes in QTc intervals among older adults. We collected retrospective data from first-time visitors to the geriatric memory clinic of Turku City Hospital in 2017 and 2019. We included patients who were newly prescribed ChEIs and had ECG data available (n = 126, mean age 81.1 years, 56.3% female). QTc prolongation was defined as ≥460 ms in females and ≥450 ms in men. Paired   tests compared QTc means before and during ChEI use, and McNemar tests analyzed changes in the proportion of prolonged QTc. Mean ± SD QTc (ms) before versus during ChEI use was: 420.8 ± 24.0 versus 423.9 ± 28.0 (  = .13) for donepezil; 416.0 ± 20.4 versus 416.5 ± 26.1 (  = .92) for galantamine; 416.1 ± 22.3 versus 409.6 ± 20.1 (  = .30) for rivastigmine; and 419.7 ± 23.4 versus 421.5 ± 27.3 (  = .34) for all ChEIs. Prolonged QTc occurred in 7.9% of patients before versus 12.7% during ChEI use (  = .21). We found no statistically significant association between ChEI use and QTc interval prolongation or an increased proportion of pathological QTc values during ChEI treatment.

  "abstract": "Mental health issues represent a prevalent challenge for employees and their employers, leading to substantial impacts on individuals, society, and the economy. Different employee mental health programs (EMHPs) can support employees in preventing and treating mental health issues. However, the impact of such EMHPs depends largely on the use behavior of employees. This study aimed to gain deeper insights into employees' attitude and use behavior regarding EMHPs by investigating (1) employee preference and intention to use EMHPs, (2) factors that predict use, and (3) key facilitators and barriers influencing use. An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach was applied, including a scoping review, qualitative interviews, and a quantitative web-based survey. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 employees to gain insights into EMHPs from the employee perspective and inform the creation of a web-based questionnaire. The quantitative web-based survey was conducted to collect representative primary data on employees' perspectives on different EMHPs using 7-point Likert scales. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics, including repeated measures ANOVAs and chi-square tests. The final sample of the web-based survey consisted of 1134 participants and was representative across several sociodemographic characteristics. Analysis of the sample revealed that when given the choice, employees preferred digital (n=666, 58.73%) and self-intervention (n=590, 52.03%) EMHPs. Employees were most likely to use EMHPs focused on prevention (mean 4.89, SD 1.61). Intention to use EMHPs was predicted by age (young: mean 4.59, SD 1.2; old: mean 4.19, SD 1.4; P<.001; Cohen d=0.32), education (academic degree: mean 4.68, SD 1.24; no academic degree: mean 4.26, SD 1.32; P<.001; Cohen d=0.32), and mostly by company culture (positive company culture: mean 4.61, SD 1.27; negative company culture: mean 3.99, SD 1.27; P<.001; Cohen d=0.49). Cost coverage (n=345, 30.42%) and ease of use (n=337, 29.72%) were critical facilitators of use. Employers can have a positive contribution to employee mental health by starting to offer EMHPs, preferably digital self-intervention programs for prevention; creating and maintaining the right work environment and culture; and ensuring cost coverage for the EMHP.",

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of natural compounds in enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments. Baicalin, a bioactive compound from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits significant anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in modulating lung cancer cell behavior through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-mediated ferroptosis pathway. We employed cyber pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to predict and validate the interaction between baicalin and ALOX12. In vitro experiments were conducted on A549 lung cancer cells to assess the effects of baicalin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression levels of ALOX12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis markers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Baicalin treatment significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression in lung cancer cells, and this upregulation was associated with a reduction in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, baicalin-induced ferroptosis was characterized by increased ROS levels, iron accumulation, and elevated expression of GPX4 and ACSL4. These findings suggest that baicalin enhances ferroptosis through ALOX12 activation, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell growth. Baicalin significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression, promoted ferroptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 lung cancer cells. This finding provides evidence for the potential use of baicalin as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer and highlights the importance of ALOX12 in lung cancer treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Several lines of treatment can be used sequentially in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We investigated the evolution of patient/tumor characteristics and their prognostic impact across treatment lines to develop an overall prognostic score (OPS). Individual patient data from 48 randomized trials were analyzed. The end point was overall survival (from random assignment to death). Missing data were imputed. The complete data set was then separated into construction (80%) and validation sets (20%). The Cox's model was used to define risk groups for survival using the OPS. The discrimination capability was assessed in each treatment-line via bootstrapping to obtain optimism-corrected calibration and discrimination C-indices. Internal validation was done in the validation set. A total of 37,560 patients (26,974 in first-line [1L], 7,693 in second-line [2L], and 2,893 in third-line [3L]) were analyzed. Some clinical, biological, and molecular characteristics of patients/tumors included in therapeutic trials evolve over the lines. Seven independent prognostic variables were retained in the final multivariate model common to all lines: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, hemoglobin, platelet count, WBC/absolute neutrophil count ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and the number of metastatic sites. The OPS was used to define four patient subgroups with significantly different prognoses in 1L, 2L, and 3L, separately, with adequate C-indices: 0.65, 0.66, and 0.69 in the construction set and 0.65, 0.66, and 0.68 in the validation set, respectively. The OPS was not predictive, with 3L drugs (  placebo) or subsequent line (2L/1L or 3L/2L) extending survival in all prognostic groups. The same prognostic model using practical variables can be used before all treatment lines. The OPS could better stratify patients in future clinical trials and help to therapeutic decision in routine practice.",

  "abstract": "To compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of three anesthetic techniques during microwave ablation (MWA) for subpleural stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This prospective, single-center clinical trial enrolled patients with subpleural stage I NSCLC between January 2024 and December 2024. Patients were assigned to one of three anesthesia groups: intercostal nerve block (INB), pleural infiltration anesthesia (PIA), or local anesthesia (LA). The primary endpoints were perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse events within 30 days of MWA. Sixty patients (mean age 73.88 ± 6.44 years; 28 men) were included in the analysis. The PIA group had intraoperative VAS scores comparable to the INB group and significantly lower than the LA group (2.70 ± 1.34 vs. 2.85 ± 1.73 vs. 6.26 ± 1.41, respectively). Postoperatively, VAS scores at 2 h were significantly lower in the PIA and INB groups compared to the LA group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the PIA and INB groups (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.35 ± 1.63 vs. 2.25 ± 1.02). There was no significant difference in VAS scores at 24 h post-ablation (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.40 ± 1.57 vs. 1.50 ± 1.64). The technical success and efficacy rates were 100%. No procedure-related deaths occurred within 30 days of MWA, and most adverse events were minor. INB and PIA significantly reduced perioperative pain compared to LA. No significant difference in adverse events incidence was observed among the three groups.",

  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are rising in China, with high body mass index (BMI) established as a significant risk factor. However, comprehensive evidence regarding the BMI-attributable CRC burden in the Chinese population remains limited. This study aims to analyze the trend of CRC burden attributable to high BMI (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m ) in China from 1990 to 2021 and to predict its development from 2022 to 2035, in order to provide a scientific foundation for the formulation of public health policies. We analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) to assess the BMI-attributable CRC burden in China from 1990 to 2021. Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models. Future projections through 2035 were generated using Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling. The Das Gupta method was used to explore the contribution of population growth, aging, and epidemiologic factors to these burden changes. From 1990 to 2021, China's BMI-attributable CRC burden increased substantially, with ASMR and ASDR rising at annual rates of 2.393% (95% CI 2.306-2.481) and 2.305% (95% CI 2.188-2.422), respectively. The mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate both increased with age. Males showed higher burden rates in most age groups. Projections indicate continued increases in ASMR (2.43% annually) and ASDR (2.44% annually) through 2035. Epidemiological factors were the primary drivers, contributing 99.73% to mortality changes and 44.81% to DALYs changes. The BMI-attributable CRC burden in China shows a concerning upward trajectory that is predicted to continue, with epidemiologic factors playing a major role. Urgent public health interventions targeting obesity prevention, lifestyle modification, and expanded CRC screening are needed to mitigate this growing burden.",

In this study, we included a total of 4,625 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database spanning from 2001 to 2008. We calculated indices related to central obesity for each participant and then employed univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) analysis. we found that the indices of Weight, Waist Circumference (WC), waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), and Body Roundness Index (BRI) were significantly elevated in the BPH group. In terms of dietary intake, we found that the intake of total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol was significantly higher in the BPH group, with polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol meeting the criteria for both univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Weight, WC, WHtR, and BRI can effectively improve the prediction of BPH, which may be associated with the high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Appropriately adjusting the types and total amount of fat intake may prevent the occurrence of prostatic hyperplasia.",

  "abstract": "The microbiome is a significant multimicrobial community that coexists with the human body in a symbiotic relationship. These microbial communities participate in mechanisms, such as defense against infections, absorption of nutrients, and maintenance of internal homeostasis. Although the microbiome is involved in physiological processes that are beneficial to host health, it can also lead to serious problems. Despite being far apart, the oral cavity and colon are both highly colonized by different microbial communities. Studies have shown that oral bacteria can migrate to and colonize the colon, which is most evident in diseases such as periodontitis. These oral pathogenic bacteria, which contain a large number of carcinogenic factors such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, can penetrate the large intestine and cause intestinal microbial imbalance and dysfunction, thereby stimulating carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that oral microbiota, especially certain periodontal pathogens, may be used as biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC). Understanding the exact mechanisms of microbiome interactions and their impact on CRC will provide future opportunities for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, and is an important prerequisite for its use as a precise noninvasive biomarker, which is crucial for the early detection of CRC. This review aims to summarize the current research status of oral microbiota, gut microbiota, and their association with CRC, and to evaluate the effectiveness of oral microbiome-derived biomarkers.",

  "abstract": "Identifying individuals with dementia is crucial for prevalence estimation and service planning, but reliable, scalable methods are lacking. We developed novel set algorithms using both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, applying Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for dementia case identification. Our cohort (n = 1082) included individuals aged ≥ 60 with dementia identified through specialist clinics and a comparison group without dementia. Clinicians from Australia and the United States informed predictor selection. We developed algorithms through a biostatistics stream for structured data and a natural language processing (NLP) stream for text, synthesizing results via logistic regression. The final structured model retained 16 variables (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.853, specificity 72.2%, sensitivity 80.6%). NLP classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest models) performed comparably. The final, combined model outperformed all others (AUC = 0.951, P < 0.001 for comparison to structured model). Embedding text-derived insights within algorithms trained on structured medical data significantly enhances dementia identification capacity. Algorithmic tools for detection of individuals with dementia are available; however, previous work has used heterogeneous case definitions which are not clinically meaningful, and has relied on proxies such as diagnostic codes or medications for case ascertainment. We used a novel, dual-stream algorithmic development approach, simultaneously and separately modeling a clinically meaningful outcome (diagnosis of dementia according to specialized clinical impression) using structured and unstructured electronic health record datasets. Our clinically grounded case definition supported the inclusion of key structured variables (such as dementia International Classification of Disease codes and medications) as modeling predictors rather than outcomes. Our algorithms, published in detail to support validation and replication, represent a major step forward in the use of routinely collected data for detection of diagnosed dementia.",

  "abstract": "Many of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are children and adolescents, and the incidence of pediatric IBD is increasing. However, understanding epidemiological trends is crucial for effective prevention and treatment and reducing the local and global burden of IBD. Little data exist regarding the incidence of IBD in the child population in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Voivodeship. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of IBD in the period 2011 - 2022 and to compare the data regarding three types of IBD, namely ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and unclassified inflammatory bowel disease (IBD-U), from the first half, i.e. 2011 - 2016, to the second half, i.e. 2017 - 2022. This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 118 IBD patients hospitalized at the Department of Pediatrics, Allergology and Gastroenterology from the central-northern part of Poland. Of the 118 patients diagnosed with IBD, 48 (40.68%) had CD, 57 (48.31%) had UC, and 13 (11.01%) had IBD-U. Between 2011 and 2016, 48 new IBD patients were diagnosed, with a further 70 new cases added between 2017 and 2022, representing a significant increase over the period (P = 0.033). Also, a significant increase was seen for UC, i.e. rising from 19 new cases between 2011 and 2016, to 38 between 2017 and 2022 (P = 0.015). The increase in CD was not significant. The incidence of pediatric IBD in the central-northern district of Poland is lower than other countries, it nonetheless appears to be increasing, particularly in children with UC. The number of IBD diagnoses in children has increased by nearly 50% over the last 6 years.",

  "abstract": "Early identification of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children is important to prevent chronic symptoms and long-term negative consequences. However, PTSD often goes unrecognized in the emergency setting of hospitals and screening methods for young children are lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of an early screening tool for PTSD in a sample of young children (0-7 years) after unintentional injury. The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale - Early Screener (PEDS-ES) was administered to parents of children referred to the Emergency Department within 7 days post-accident (  = 82), and a validated interview for PTSD was administered 3 months after the accident as criterion measure: the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA). Diagnostic accuracy of the PEDS-ES was inspected using area under the curve analyses including sensitivity, specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Value. After three months PTSD diagnosis was established in 21% of the children. Use of the PEDS-ES within 7 days after the injury showed fair accuracy with AUC = .727. Sensitivity (0.65) and specificity (0.73) for the suggested cutoff of 8 were moderate for predicting PTSD diagnosis 3 months after the injury. The examination of cutoff values that achieve enhanced sensitivity in a screening context - where sensitivity is prioritized - while maintaining a high level of specificity suggests that a lower cutoff of around 6 points may serve as a more sensitive (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.56) valid alternative cutoff score. The PEDS-ES allows for successful early screening of risk for traumatic stress symptoms in young children after single accidental injury. It enables early identification of individuals who are at risk for developing PTSD and need further monitoring of symptoms, diagnostic assessment and treatment. In young children at emergency settings of hospitals, development of PTSD often goes unrecognized, while consequences can be debilitating.The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale-Early Screener (PEDS-ES) for PTSD risk in young children after accidental injury shows fair predictive power.Young children at increased risk for PTSD can be identified early and offered secondary preventive interventions.",

This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study included chronic hepatitis C patients <18 years old evaluated by pediatric hepatologists at an academic health system between 1/1/2017 and 9/30/2022. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) ≥12 weeks following treatment completion in patients initiating DAAs. Secondary endpoints were CoC advancement, variables impacting DAA initiation, patient-reported side effects, and adherence. An ordinal logistic regression model assessed whether initiation time was associated with a patient's ability to swallow, prior authorization outcome, and medication availability to HSSP at referral. The odds ratio reflects the likelihood of a shift in time to initiation for a given group relative to its respective reference group. Of 98 patients evaluated by a hepatologist, 73 (75%) were referred to the HSSP. Loss to follow-up was the primary reason (88%; 22/25) for non-referral, most commonly (73%; 16/22) in those aged ≤5 years. Following HSSP referral, 88% (64/73) initiated DAA and 92% (59/64) of those achieved SVR. Time from HSSP referral to medication initiation was impacted by DAA availability [OR=41.47; 95% CI: 9.51, 180.87; p<0.001] and inability to swallow the dosage form at evaluation [OR=3.94; 95% CI: 1.56, 9.98; p=0.004]. Over half (53%; 34/64) of patients initiating DAA reported ≥1 adverse event; none discontinued treatment. Most (69%; 44/64) reported no missed doses. The largest CoC drop-off occurred following initial clinic evaluation, primarily in children ≤5 years. Enhanced linkage to care efforts are needed in these patients. Conversely, nearly all patients referred to the HSSP were initiated on DAA, completed therapy, and achieved SVR.",

A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L. The main immunophenotype was common-B ALL (44 cases, 91.7%). Other leukemia fusion genes such as   and   were not observed in this cohort of patients. All patients received the treatment of NPCLC-ALL2008 protocol, and 5 cases (10.4%) occurred poor prednisone response. All the 48 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction treatments. The last follow-up date was April 30, 2023. A total of 5 children relapsed, including 1 case with intermediate risk and 4 cases with high risk. The recurrence rate in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the intermediate- and low-risk groups (both   < 0.05). Most relapsed children had elevated WBC counts at initial diagnosis. Among them, WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was observed in 4 cases. The recurrence rate among children with WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was significantly higher than that with WBC counts <100×10 /L (  < 0.01). Four deaths occurred in this cohort, of which 3 died of leukemia recurrence.

However, SGLT2-inhibition increases glucagon levels, which facilitate postprandial hyperfiltration. The impact of SGLT2 inhibition on protein-related hyperfiltration and postprandial (intra) kidney haemodynamic function is unclear. Moreover, the interaction with dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, known to reduce glucagon levels and to affect meal-related factors modulating GFR, is unknown. We aimed to assess the effects of empagliflozin and linagliptin in mono- and combination therapy compared to the initiation and intensification of SU-derivative gliclazide treatment on fasting and postprandial kidney haemodynamic function. We compared three 16-week glucose-lowering strategies added to ongoing metformin monotherapy: (1) EMPA-LINA: 8-week empagliflozin 10 mg QD (EMPA0-8w) followed by the addition of 8-week linagliptin 5 mg QD (LINA8-16w); (2) LINA-EMPA: 8-week linagliptin (LINA0-8w) followed by the addition of 8-week empagliflozin (EMPA8-16w) versus (3) GLIC-GLIC: 8-week gliclazide 30 mg QD (GLIC0-8w) followed by the addition of 8-week gliclazide 30 mg (GLIC8-16w). We studied (intra) kidney haemodynamic interactions of this combination using iohexol and PAH clearance techniques to assess measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). We studied n = 61 overweight people with T2D (HbA1c 62 + 11 mmol/mol, eGFR 89 [78-100] mL/min/1.73 m  and urinary albumin-creatinine-ratio 1.0 [0.4-1.9] mg/mmol). In the fasting state, EMPA0-8w (-13.2; -21.3 to -5.1 mL/min) but not LINA0-8w reduced within-group mGFR. EMPA8-16w (-10.2; -16.5 to -4.0 mL/min) but not LINA8-16w reduced within-group mGFR. Following a proteinload, EMPA0-8w (-11.4; -20.2 to -2.6 mL/min) and EMPA8-16w (-16.2; -22.9 to -9.4 mL/min) but not LINA0-8w or LINA8-16w reduced within-group mGFR. Versus the comparatorarm, fasting mGFR EMPA0-8w, EMPA8-16w and EMPA-LINA and postprandial mGFR EMPA8-16w and LINA-EMPA, were significantly reduced. mGFR reductions resulted from intrakidney efferent vasodilation rather than afferent vasoconstriction. In T2D people without CKD, the favourable kidney haemodynamic effects of empagliflozin persist in the postprandial state and are irrespective of concurrent use of linagliptin.",

  "abstract": "Exposure to air pollution and meteorological conditions, such as humidity, has been linked to adverse respiratory health outcomes in children. This study aims to develop predictive models for pediatric hospitalizations based on both environmental exposures and clinical features. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2500 children (aged 1-18) who presented with respiratory symptoms at the emergency department, during 2016-2017. Air pollution data, including NOx and NO  concentrations, and relative humidity (RH) were collected from nine monitoring stations and were cross-referenced with the children's residential locations to assess their specific exposure level. Statistical tests, including Chi-square and Wilcoxon tests, were used to analyze the data. Machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were developed to predict the children's hospitalizations. Boys were more likely to be hospitalized than girls (60.6% vs. 39.4%, p = 4.31e-06). Hospital visits peaked during winter (p = 3.56e-37). Increased emergency room visits were statistically significantly associated with highly polluted days (p = 0.038). Hospitalized children were exposed to lower RH (median 64.9%) compared to nonhospitalized children (median 69.4%, p = 0.005). The RF and XGBoost models were reliable, with accuracy rates of 0.7-0.98, Precision scores of 0.88-0.99, and AUC scores of 81%-99%. Key features included temperature, NOx levels, RH, and exposure to SO . This study investigates the effects of air pollution and humidity on pediatric respiratory health. The models developed offer valuable tools for predicting hospitalizations and are intended to support public health planning and resource allocation.",

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the accessibility of telehealth (TH) and forced a trial of incorporating remote care into routine CF care. The CF Learning Network (CFLN) organized for data sharing into a telehealth innovation lab (TH-iLab) to improve access to the interdisciplinary care team and co-produced shared agenda-setting. All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

  "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death globally in children aged 0-5 years. Early access to pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in low-resource, pre-hospital settings may result in improved pediatric pneumonia outcomes. However, few data exist regarding their application in such settings. We performed an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to examine use of pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in pre-hospital environments of Malawi. Our model yielded an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for pre-hospital pulse-oximetry use of $35 (USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared to no pulse-oximetry use. One-way sensitivity analysis showed highest sensitivity to the parameter of downstream hospitalization cost. Given that inpatient management is the standard of care for hypoxemic pneumonia, when only pre-hospital costs were considered the result was an ICER of $9.9/DALY averted. Both values were considered cost-effective according to a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold set for 1x the average GDP per capita in Malawi ($588, 2018). When oxygen was analyzed in combination with pulse-oximetry, we found a baseline WTP threshold for pre-hospital oxygen of $71 per patient. For every 1% reduction in total pediatric pneumonia mortality consequent to pre-hospital oxygen use, we determined the recommended WTP allowance for oxygen would increase by approximately $4.53. We conclude that pulse-oximetry is likely cost-effective in low-resource, pre-hospital environments. We acknowledge the need for further research on the effectiveness of pre-hospital oxygen in reducing pediatric pneumonia mortality and suggest ranges of cost and efficacy for which oxygen is likely to be found cost-effective in tandem with pulse-oximetry.",

Of 200 consecutively recruited children with a previously proven diagnosis of PBB 62 (12.2 years, female 48%) were interviewed after 7.7 (5.4-14.7) years about their previous and current symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs: spirometry, body plethysmography, nitrogen multi-breath washout, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide) were performed. Children with persistent symptoms were offered lung imaging. 11 (17.7%) patients suffered from chronic or recurring wet cough years after their first PBB episode. 15 (24.19%) had at least one abnormal spirometry parameter. FEV1 was abnormal in eight of 62 (12.9%), LCI 2.5% in seven of 56 (12.5%), FVC in 12 of 62 (19.35%) and FEV1/FVC in five of 62 (8.06%) cases. PFT did not differ between children with and without wet cough. Lung MRI/CT demonstrate in four of nine cases abnormalities of the bronchial walls, including one with incipient bronchiectasis. After PBB in early childhood, a significant proportion of children suffer from respiratory symptoms many years later, some have an objectively reduced lung function and structural changes of the bronchial wall despite adequate initial therapy. Wet cough alone seems not to be a sensitive clinical predictor. Due to the retrospective study design, we cannot proof any causal relationship. However, to detect late bronchopulmonary sequelae, continuous follow-up of these children should become mandatory.",

We aimed to assess whether changes in estimated arterial CO₂ (PaCO₂) derived from transcutaneous measurements (P CO₂) were associated with pediatric weaning failure. Children (age 72 h -18 years) with MV > 12 h were continuously monitored using a transcutaneous sensor to estimate PaCO₂ from skin CO₂ tension (P CO₂). Values were recorded during SBT (30 min on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) +5 cmH O, with pressure support of +5 cmH O for endotracheal tubes with internal diameter ≤ 3.5 mm), then up to 6 h after extubation. Mean P CO  and P CO  changes during SBT, and after extubation, were retrospectively collected to evaluate their association with SBT failure and extubation failure (reintubation within 48 h). Eighty children (median [IQR] age 1.1 [0.3; 8.7] years) were included, with 89 SBT (14 failures, 75 successes). Sixty-four patients were extubated following their first SBT, with 10 (16%) extubation failures. P CO  changes were not associated with SBT and extubation failures.

The IVW method indicated a positive correlation between USPR levels and MI (IVW, odds ratio = 1.504, 95% confidence interval: 1.108-2.041, P = 0.009). In contrast, the inverse analysis provided evidence suggesting that MI affected USPR (P > 0.05). The Cochran Q test showed heterogeneity, while the intercept test revealed no horizontal pleiotropy, and the leave-one-out analysis demonstrated that the analyses were reliable. This study provides evidence for the causal effect of the USPR on MI; however, this was not the case in the opposite situation. It is plausible that the USPR serves as a promoting factor for MI.",

This study aimed to examine the association between different CHG bathing frequencies and CLABSI rates in medical intensive care units (MICUs). A retrospective analysis was conducted in three MICUs in northern Taiwan from March 2018 to June 2022. One MICU implemented daily CHG bathing for 21 months, followed by every-other-day CHG bathing for 30 months, while two MICUs used water and soap as standard care. CLABSI rates per 1000 central line days and other clinical outcomes were compared. Across 46 409 central line days and 5482 admissions, 357 CLABSI events were recorded. No significant difference in CLABSI rates was found between the CHG and standard care groups (IRR = 1.1, p = 0.36) or between the different CHG bathing frequencies (IRR = 0.68, p = 0.06). Other clinical outcomes showed no significant differences. CHG bathing, whether daily or alternate-day, was not significantly associated with lowering CLABSI rates in MICU. The association may vary depending on hospital-specific conditions and infection profiles. CHG bathing should not be regarded as a universal infection control strategy in ICUs. It should be evaluated within the context of each ICU's specific conditions and infection prevention strategy.",

  "abstract": "Migraine has an assumed polygenic basis, but the genetic risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies only explain a proportion of the heritability. We aimed to develop machine learning models, capturing non-additive and interactive effects, to address the missing heritability. This was a cross-sectional population-based study of participants in the second and third Trøndelag Health Study. Individuals underwent genome-wide genotyping and were phenotyped based on validated modified criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Four datasets of increasing number of genetic variants were created using different thresholds of linkage disequilibrium and univariate genome-wide associated p-values. A series of machine learning and deep learning methods were optimized and evaluated. The genotype tools PLINK and LDPred2 were used for polygenic risk scoring. Models were trained on a partition of the dataset and tested in a hold-out set. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was used as the primary scoring metric. Classification by machine learning was statistically compared to that of polygenic risk scoring. Finally, we explored the biological functions of the variants unique to the machine learning approach. 43,197 individuals (51% women), with a mean age of 54.6 years, were included in the modelling. A light gradient boosting machine performed best for the three smallest datasets (108, 7,771 and 7,840 variants), all with hold-out test set area under curve at 0.63. A multinomial naïve Bayes model performed best in the largest dataset (140,467 variants) with a hold-out test set area under curve of 0.62. The models were statistically significantly superior to polygenic risk scoring (area under curve 0.52 to 0.59) for all the datasets (p<0.001 to p=0.02). Machine learning identified many of the same genes and pathways identified in genome-wide association studies, but also several unique pathways, mainly related to signal transduction and neurological function. Interestingly, pathways related to botulinum toxins, and pathways related to the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor also emerged. This study suggests that migraine may follow a non-additive and interactive genetic causal structure, potentially best captured by complex machine learning models. Such structure may be concealed where the data dimensionality (high number of genetic variants) is insufficiently supported by the scale of available data, leaving a misleading impression of purely additive effects. Future machine learning models using substantially larger sample sizes could harness both the additive and the interactive effects, enhancing precision and offering deeper understanding of genetic interactions underlying migraine.",

The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study. The artificial intelligence model for real-time visual neurorecognition in total mesorectal excision was successfully established for the first time in China.

The present study was designed to explore the expression of FKBP51 in murine utricle hair cells (HCs) and the possible mechanisms underpinning the actions of FKBP51 relevant to gentamicin-mediated toxicity, with special attention given to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activities in vitro. Here, we found, for the first time, that FKBP51 was widely expressed in both cytoplasm and cytomembrane. Moreover, the expression of FKBP51 in cultured HCs of utricle was downregulated after exposure to 1 mM gentamicin for 24 h. Then, the fkbp51 knockout mice were utilized to further investigate the role of FKBP51 in HCs in response to gentamicin. And the absence of FKBP51 led to severe HCs loss, accumulated ROS levels, and increased apoptotic factors, which could be alleviated by 2 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to certain degree. In addition, mechanistic studies with 10 mM BAY 11-7082 showed that FKBP51 protected HCs against gentamicin-induced damage, at least in part, via blocking the NF-κB pathway activation. Taken together, our new findings suggest that FKBP51 might serve as a new target for the prevention of HCs of utricle from aminoglycoside-induced vestibular toxicity.",

We developed novel set algorithms using both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, applying Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for dementia case identification. Our cohort (n = 1082) included individuals aged ≥ 60 with dementia identified through specialist clinics and a comparison group without dementia. Clinicians from Australia and the United States informed predictor selection. We developed algorithms through a biostatistics stream for structured data and a natural language processing (NLP) stream for text, synthesizing results via logistic regression. The final structured model retained 16 variables (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.853, specificity 72.2%, sensitivity 80.6%). NLP classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest models) performed comparably. The final, combined model outperformed all others (AUC = 0.951, P < 0.001 for comparison to structured model). Embedding text-derived insights within algorithms trained on structured medical data significantly enhances dementia identification capacity. Algorithmic tools for detection of individuals with dementia are available; however, previous work has used heterogeneous case definitions which are not clinically meaningful, and has relied on proxies such as diagnostic codes or medications for case ascertainment. We used a novel, dual-stream algorithmic development approach, simultaneously and separately modeling a clinically meaningful outcome (diagnosis of dementia according to specialized clinical impression) using structured and unstructured electronic health record datasets. Our clinically grounded case definition supported the inclusion of key structured variables (such as dementia International Classification of Disease codes and medications) as modeling predictors rather than outcomes. Our algorithms, published in detail to support validation and replication, represent a major step forward in the use of routinely collected data for detection of diagnosed dementia.",

However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

Sin embargo, su importancia en el cáncer rectal localmente avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia neoadyuvante sigue sin explorarse.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronóstico de la reacción desmoplásica en muestras de pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia.DISEÑO:Este es un estudio retrospectivo.ESCENARIO:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un solo centro oncológico integral.PACIENTES:El estudio incluyó a 255 pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado que se sometieron a quimiorradioterapia basada en fluoropirimidina seguida de una escisión mesorrectal total entre 2005 y 2014. La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó en categorías madura, intermedia e inmadura según el análisis histológico.RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES:Los resultados primarios fueron la supervivencia sin recurrencia y la supervivencia general. RESULTADOS: La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó como madura (69,0%), intermedia (5,5%) o inmadura (25,5%). El grupo maduro tuvo un mayor porcentaje de buenos respondedores (34,1%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (0%) e inmaduro (4,6%) (p < 0,0001). El grupo maduro se correlacionó con mejores resultados, con una mayor supervivencia libre de recurrencia a 5 años (85,4%) y supervivencia general (93,0%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (45,1% y 76,2%, respectivamente) e inmaduro (65,8% y 88,8%, respectivamente). En el análisis multivariable, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció significativamente con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia ( p = 0,03). Entre los malos respondedores, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia (p = 0,03). La quimioterapia adyuvante no mejoró significativamente la tasa de supervivencia sin recurrencia a 5 años para el grupo maduro (quimioterapia adyuvante vs. ninguna quimioterapia, 86,4% vs. 84,8%; p = 0,64), observándose tendencias peores en el grupo combinado intermedio/inmaduro (55,9% vs. 69,4%, respectivamente, p = 0,27).LIMITACIONES:Las limitaciones incluyen la naturaleza subjetiva de la evaluación de la reacción desmoplásica y el diseño retrospectivo del estudio.CONCLUSIONES:La reacción desmoplásica en muestras quirúrgicas después de la quimiorradioterapia se asocia con respuestas a la quimiorradioterapia y sirve como un factor pronóstico significativo en el cáncer rectal avanzado, particularmente para aquellos que responden mal a la quimiorradioterapia.

  "abstract": "Mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is a common procedure used in orthognathic surgery. The greatest complication of BSSO is damage to the inferior alveolar nerve, resulting in facial numbness and poor quality of life. This study aimed to create a low-cost, biomechanically accurate 3D-printed mandible model for surgical training to prevent such complications. A 3D mandible model was created from CT scans and printed using 12 different resin mixtures. Biomechanical testing was performed to determine percent elongation, tensile strength, yield strength, and Young's modulus. Four surgeons performed user testing to determine the most realistic model. The authors compared the osteotomy force profile of the best model to the human cadaveric mandible and commercially available model. A mix of 45% Anycubic Colored UV and 55% Siraya Tech Tenacious resins was found to best mimic human bone. Surgeons reported feeling an accurate proprioceptive transition between cancellous and cortical bone. The osteotomy force profiles were similar across our 3D-printed (left: 2.66±1.67 N, right: 3.23±1.80 N), cadaveric (left: 3.18±1.81 N, right: 2.16±0.96 N), and commercial (left: 2.69±1.68 N, right: 3.10±1.88 N) mandibles. On maximal force testing, this model (left: 6.18 N, right: 6.80 N) closely resembled the cadaveric mandible (left: 6.59 N, right: 3.99 N) and commercially available model (left: 6.31 N, right: 6.39 N). A low-cost 3D-printed mandible was developed and validated for surgical simulation in BSSO. Future applications include resident education and preoperative planning.",

  "abstract": "After neoadjuvant therapy, pathologic analysis of rectal cancer resected specimens may show a complete response in the primary tissue cancer with residual tumor in the lymph nodes (ypT0N+). The aim of this study was to describe the 5-year overall survival and factors associated with survival of ypT0N+ patients with rectal cancer who had neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and to compare these patients' survival with patients in other pathologic categories. We conducted a retrospective analysis. We used the National Cancer Database. We identified patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total neoadjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery between 2006 and 2016. Besides ypT0N+, 5 pathologic categories were identified: ypT0N0, ypT1-2N0, ypT3-4N0, ypT1-2N+, and ypT3-4N+. The primary outcome measure was 5-year overall survival. We included 30,751 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A total of 342 patients developed ypT0N+, of whom 181 (52.9%) received total neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients who received total neoadjuvant therapy, developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, ypT0N+ disease was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between ypT0N+ and ypT3-4N0 or ypT1-2N+. Similar findings were noticed among patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ypT0N+, older age, male gender, and higher number of positive lymph nodes were all associated with a decrease in the overall survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study, lack of variables describing the chemotherapy and radiation regimens used, and paucity of data on disease-specific survival or recurrence. Developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, it was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+.

  "abstract": "Cisplatin is an effective antineoplastic drug used worldwide in the treatment of various malignancies. However, it is associated with side effects, including cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been suggested as a promising drug to prevent or reduce cisplatin-derived ototoxicity. To evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy of NAC in preventing CIHL, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Library. Articles reporting the administration of systemic or transtympanic injection of NAC for CIHL prevention were considered. The outcomes of interest included the presence of hearing loss events and changes in hearing thresholds at 0.5 through 12 kHz following cisplatin treatment. A total of 7 studies involving 217 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 175 received systemic administration of NAC, and the remaining received transtympanic injection of NAC. No significant differences were found in CIHL prevention between the use of either systemic or transtympanic NAC administration compared to placebo (risk ratio [RR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-1.19; P = .28, and RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.51-1.54; P = .67, respectively). No significant differences were found at 0.5 to 8 kHz between groups. Qualitative analyses suggested a tendency to otoprotection in ultra-high frequencies (10 and 12 kHz). Our findings suggest that, regardless of administration route, current published evidence does not show that NAC is effective in preventing CIHL in the standard clinical audiogram range. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm our findings. I.",

  "abstract": "Despite technical progress and novel ablation strategies, pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the elimination of antral low-voltage, fragmented electrograms (LFEGMs) identified by high-density (HD) mapping on the rate of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) durability. Sixty patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) were randomly assigned to a verification of PV entrance block and presence of LFEGMs on antral isolation lines with an HD mapping catheter (HD group) or to a verification of PV entrance block with a circumferential mapping catheter alone (CM group). In the HD group, LFEGMs were additionally ablated. Mandatory reassessment procedure to assess PVI durability and the presence of LFEGMs was performed 12 months after the index procedure or earlier in case of arrhythmia recurrence. A total of 107 out of 116 (92.2%) PVs were found durably isolated in the HD group, and 97 out of 120 (80.8%) PVs in the CM group (p = 0.02). At the reassessment procedure, a total of 7 [3, 12] and 34 [24, 44] LFEGMs were found in the HD and CM groups, respectively (p = 0.00002). Elimination of LFEGMs at the index procedure reduced the likelihood of antral conduction gaps in the same segments at the reassessment. Arrhythmia recurrence rate was similar between the HD and the CM group (7/29, 24.1% vs. 10/30, 33.3%), p = 0.62, respectively. Additional elimination of LFEGMs identified by HD mapping of antral isolation lines after PVI resulted in a significantly higher rate of PVI durability.

  "abstract": "Understanding pathological changes in the brain is essential for guiding treatment decisions in brain injuries and diseases. Despite significant advances in brain imaging techniques, clinical practice still faces challenges due to infrastructure reliance and high resource demands. This review explores the current knowledge on blood-based biomarkers that indicate brain pathology, which can assist in identifying at-risk patients, diagnosing patients, predicting disease progression, and treatment response. We focus on the inherited metabolic disorders X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) which share remarkable phenotypic variability. Disease-specific increases in the lipid metabolites lyso-PC26:0 in X-ALD and sulfatides in MLD might contribute to predicting clinical manifestation. Disease-unspecific biomarkers for axonal damage (neurofilament light chain protein, NfL) and glial degeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) are able to distinguish X-ALD and MLD phenotypes at the group level. The implementation of X-ALD into newborn screening programs in various countries, including several U.S. states, has increased the demand for predictive blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting the early conversion from the pre-symptomatic to the early neuroinflammatory cerebral form of X-ALD. Among different biomarkers, NfL has proven most effective in reflecting neuroinflammation and correlating with brain lesion volume and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based severity scores. We discuss how NfL has moved from initial proof-of-principle towards proof-of-concept studies in brain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and how this knowledge could be applied for the clinical implementation of NfL in rare inherited metabolic disorders such as X-ALD.",

  "abstract": "Prospective payment models have incentivized reductions in length of stay after surgery. The benefits of abbreviated postoperative hospitalization could be undermined by increased readmissions or postacute care use, particularly for older adults or those with comorbid conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hospitals with accelerated postsurgical discharge accrue total episode savings or incur greater postdischarge payments among patients stratified by age and comorbidity. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. National data from the 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files for July 2012 to June 2015 were used. We included Medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective colectomy and stratified the cohort by age (65-69, 70-79, ≥80 y) and Elixhauser comorbidity score (low: ≤0; medium: 1-5; and high: >5). Patients were categorized by the hospital's mode length of stay, reflecting \"usual\" care. In a multilevel model, we compared mean total episode payments and components thereof among age and comorbidity categories, stratified by hospital mode length of stay. Among 88,860 patients, mean total episode payments were lower in shortest versus longest length of stay hospitals across all age and comorbidity strata and were similar between age groups (65-69 y: $28,951 vs $30,566, p = 0.014; 70-79 y: $31,157 vs $32,044, p = 0.073; ≥80 y: $33,779 vs $35,771, p = 0.005) but greater among higher comorbidity (low: $23,107 vs $24,894, p = 0.001; medium: $30,809 vs $32,282, p = 0.038; high: $44,097 vs $46641, p < 0.001). Postdischarge payments were similar among length-of-stay hospitals by age (65-69 y: ∆$529; 70-79 y: ∆$291; ≥80 y: ∆$872, p = 0.25) but greater among high comorbidity (low: ∆$477; medium: ∆$480; high: ∆$1059; p = 0.02). Administrative data do not capture patient-level factors that influence postacute care use (preference, caregiver availability). Hospitals achieving shortest length of stay after surgery accrue lower total episode payments without a compensatory increase in postacute care spending, even among patients at oldest age and with greatest comorbidity.

  "abstract": "To illustrate improved posttonsillectomy hemorrhage rates with a novel cost-effective monopolar intracapsular tonsillectomy (ICT) technique. Retrospective cohort. Single physician's experience at a Midwest private practice. A single surgeon's chart review of 576 pediatric patients who underwent a tonsillectomy in the last 20 years was completed. In total, 331 cases were treated with ICT performed with a novel monopolar bovie electrocautery technique, as opposed to the more widely used microdebrider or coblator techniques. In total, 246 were treated with the traditional extracapsular tonsillectomy (ECT) technique using monopolar electrocautery. Of the 331 ICTs performed, one postoperative hemorrhage requiring intervention was identified, resulting in an ICT postoperative bleed rate of 0.3%. Of the 246 ECTs performed, 9 postoperative bleeds requiring intervention were identified, resulting in an ECT postoperative bleed rate of 3.7%. In this cohort, the relative risk of developing a bleed with ECT was 12 times higher than the bleed risk with ICT (  = .018). Every 30 cases of ICT prevented one tonsil bleed (number needed to treat [NNT] = 29.8). Potential savings of ICT with monopolar cautery is $1.5 to $1.6 million for every 10,000 cases that transition to ICT with electrocautery from a microdebrider or coblator technique. ICT with monopolar electrocautery resulted in a significantly decreased bleed rate compared to the ECT technique in this single surgeon experience and at a much lower cost compared to the more widely used microdebrider or coblator techniques.",

  "abstract": "The treatment of complex transposition of the great arteries with a ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis/left outflow tract obstruction poses significant challenges. The decision between performing a Rastelli procedure, a Nikaidoh procedure or a double root rotation depends on the cardiac anatomy, especially the location of the ventricular septal defect, its spatial relationship with the great arteries, the presence of straddling of the atrioventricular valve and the appreciation of the pulmonary valve. In our centre, our goal is to provide the most physiologic repair tailored to each patient's unique anatomy and to try to preserve the pulmonary valve in the pulmonary position, despite some degree of residual stenosis. We demonstrate three different surgical techniques adapted for various anatomies: one en bloc double root rotation, one double root translocation with separation of the roots and one modified Nikaidoh procedure.",

The cases were visually classified into predefined dementia patterns using  F-FDG PET by three experts. A region-of-interest (ROI)-based automated analysis of  F-FDG PET was also performed. The participants were followed up for 12 months, and the clinical diagnosis of dementia was re-evaluated.ResultsThe sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the visual reading of  F-FDG PET for differentiating AD from FTLD were 94%, 78%, and 92%, respectively. In contrast, those of p-tau181 in CSF were 62%, 79%, and 65%, respectively. The sensitivity, the primary endpoint, was 32% higher for  F-FDG PET than for p-tau181 in CSF. Additionally, the accuracy, the secondary endpoint, was 27% higher for  F-FDG PET than for p-tau181 in CSF. In addition to the visual reading of  F-FDG PET, the ROI-based automated analysis showed sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 81%, 79%, and 81%, respectively.ConclusionsThis study showed that the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET in differential diagnosis of AD and FTLD was higher than that of p-tau181 in CSF.Trial registrationUMIN-CTR (UMIN 000016427, https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/) and Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs041180098, https://jrct.mhlw.go.jp/).",

  "abstract": "The Clavien-Dindo classification is widely used to report postoperative morbidity but may underestimate the severity of colectomy complications. The purpose of this study was to assess how well the Clavien-Dindo classification represents the severity of all grades of complications after colectomy using cost of care modeling. This was a retrospective cohort study. The study was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients (N = 1807) undergoing elective colon or rectal resections without a stoma performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 who were followed up for ≥90 days, were not transferred to other hospitals, and did not receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy were included in the study. Complication severity was measured by the highest-grade complication per patient and attributable outpatient and inpatient costs. Associations were evaluated between patient complication grade and cost during 3 time periods: the 90 days after surgery, index admission, and postdischarge (<90 d). Of the 1807 patients (median age = 62 y), 779 (43%) had a complication; 80% of these patients had only grade 1 or 2 complications. Increasing patient complication grade correlated with 90-day cost, driven by inpatient cost differences (p < 0.001). For grade 1 and 2 patients, most costs were incurred after discharge and were the same between these grade categories. Among patients with a single complication (52%), there was no difference in index hospitalization, postdischarge, or total 90-day costs between grade 1 and 2 categories. The study was limited by its retrospective design and generalizability. The Clavien-Dindo classification correlates well with 90-day costs, driven largely by inpatient resource use. Clavien-Dindo does not discriminate well among patients with low-grade complications in terms of their substantial postdischarge costs. These patients represent 80% of patients with a complication after colectomy. Examining the long-term burden associated with complications can help refine the Clavien-Dindo classification for use in colectomy studies. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B521.

  "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) is the primary treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), while its impact on sinonasal mucosa is unclear. We aimed to investigate the progression of sinus mucosal inflammation pre- and post-RT in NPC patients and aid in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced rhinosinusitis (RiRS). This study was based on a prospective cohort with 1410 NPC patients. RiRS was evaluated by the Lund-Mackay score (LMS). A prediction model incorporating clinicopathological factors, radiomics features, and dosimetric parameters was developed using least absolute shrinkage regression and validated internally and externally using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration tests, and decision curve analysis. LMS trajectories were analyzed using latent-class growth analysis. 1017 patients with a median follow-up of 106.5 months were enrolled. Before RT, 7.5 % of patients (n = 76) had rhinosinusitis, which has increased to 47.2 % after RT. The V30Gy of the sinuses (relative sinus volume receiving doses > 30 Gy), pre-RT LMS abnormalities, and tumor invasion of sphenoidal base independently influenced RiRS. The prediction model based on these three factors exhibited good discrimination and calibration. Three distinct trajectories of RiRS were identified: increasing LMS, decreasing LMS with a high starting score, and decreasing LMS with a low starting score. V70Gy showed significant association with the LMS trajectories. RiRS is a common complication in NPC patients, influenced by radiation dose in the sinuses, baseline sinus mucosa status, and tumor invasion. Patients with large sinus volumes receiving high radiation doses are more likely to develop RiRS.",

  "abstract": "Transvenous lead extraction (TLE) is recognized as an effective method of lead extraction, but can be challenging with old and tined pacemaker leads. We present the case of a 44-year-old male with cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infection who underwent TLE of his 15-year-old tined pacemaker leads using a novel approach. A carotid shuttle sheath with the tip fashioned into a bevel shape was used as a makeshift dilator to dissect and free the leads from adhesions. A bioptome, introduced through the TightRail sheath, was employed to dislodge the right ventricular (RV) lead tip, while a snare introduced subsequently through the same access was used to grip the distal end of the RV lead. The lead was extracted using the snare without the need for additional femoral or jugular access. To the best of our knowledge, the use of this bioptome and snare technique, through the TightRail sheath, without employing femoral or jugular access for lead extraction, has not been previously reported. This case highlights the importance of innovative techniques in successfully addressing challenging TLE cases.",

To investigate the influence of adding High power pain threshold ultrasound technique to traditional therapy on axioappendicular muscles amplitude and fatigue of patients with mechanical neck pain. Single-blind, Randomized clinical trial. Outpatient clinic. Sixty patients (19-38 years old) with mechanical neck pain participated in this study and were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the faculty of physical therapy after a referral from an orthopedist. Patients were randomly assigned by the opaque sealed envelope to two treatment groups: Group A Received High power pain threshold ultrasound (HPPTUS), traditional therapy in form of (active range of motion, stretching exercises, and postural correction exercises (PCES), whereas Group B Received traditional therapy only; therapeutic sessions were performed Twice/week for 4 weeks. The visual analog scale, pressure pain threshold, neck disability index, upper trapezius and Levator scapulae median frequency, and root mean square were used to evaluate the patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment status. Multiple pairwise comparisons within each group revealed statistically significant differences in all outcome variables in both groups with favor to the HPPTUS group as p = 0.0001. Between group analysis at post treatment revealed statistical significant difference between both groups in all outcome variables as p = 0.0001. The High-power Pain Threshold Ultrasound technique combined with traditional therapy is an effective method more than traditional therapy alone for management the patients with MNP. The present study has implications, especially for clinical decision-making with regard to the therapy of choice in MNP to reduce pain, improve function and muscle activity through HPPTUS technique, and its impact on normal lifestyle and highlight the need for active intervention.",

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

  "abstract": "Hypertension is a significant public health issue, particularly among middle-aged and older adults. This study investigated the impact of multidimensional social participation, including its diversity and frequency, on hypertension in this population in China, with a focus on urban-rural differences. Using data from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which included 12 165 participants aged 45 and older, social participation was categorized by diversity (e.g., voluntary activities, Mahjong, cards, chess, or other clubs) and frequency. Hypertension was determined based on self-reported diagnoses, medication use, and blood pressure measurements. Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for demographic and health-related factors, revealed that more diverse social participation was associated with lower hypertension rates (OR = 0.718, 95% CI = 0.612, 0.840). Participating more than once a week also correlated with reduced hypertension risk (OR = 0.877, 95% CI = 0.803, 0.958). Specific activities, such as volunteering, internet use, and Mahjong, were notably protective against hypertension. Subgroup analyses highlighted urban-rural disparities, with differing impacts of social participation observed. However, interaction analyses showed that urban-rural residency did not significantly modify the relationship between social participation and hypertension. These findings emphasize the role of social participation in mitigating hypertension risk among middle-aged and older Chinese adults, and underscore the need for targeted public health strategies to address urban-rural disparities and promote social participation.",

  "abstract": "Numerous techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been described. The present study aims to determine the proportion of wrists with CTS in which the application of DN avoids surgery. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial clinical trial was performed. Eighty-six wrists with diagnosis of mild or moderate CTS and indication for surgery were recruited from a hospital traumatology service. The intervention group was treated with DN, with a frequency of one session/week over six weeks, while the control group did not follow any specific treatment, remaining on the waiting list for the surgery. The main variable was the recommendation for surgery. Other secondary variables included changes in electromyography and ultrasound; intensity of pain; Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ); hand dynamometries; and possible adverse effects. The wrists treated by DN had a reduced risk of needing surgery at 12 weeks by 62% compared to the control group (RR = 0.38, 95% CI[0.2-0.72]), with this value being significant (p-value = 0.003). This group also obtained a significant improvement in the intensity of pain (p-value = 0.006), and in the BCTQ-severity of syntoms scale and BCTQ-functional situation scale (p-value = 0.039 and p-value = 0.019 respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in the dynamometries performed, nor in the results of the electromyography and ultrasound studies. Adverse effects were infrequent or unimportant. Application of DN to wrists with mild or moderate CTS reduces the need for surgery, and improves the clinical symptoms and functionality of the hand.",

  "abstract": "Watchful waiting in patients with rectal cancer with complete clinical response after chemoradiation therapy has gained increased popularity to avoid morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. Irradiation of the pelvis causes bowel dysfunction, but the effect on anorectal sensory function remains obscure in this patient category. The aim of this study was to characterize the sensory pathways of the gut-brain axis in patients with rectal cancer treated solely with chemoradiation therapy (nonconventional regime/dose) compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study. Sensory evaluation by rectal distension was performed and cortical evoked potentials were recorded during rapid balloon distensions of the rectum and anal canal. Latencies and amplitudes of cortical evoked potentials were compared, and the relative amplitude of 5 spectral bands from recorded cortical evoked potentials was used as an additional proxy of neuronal processing. Patients with rectal cancer solely with chemoradiation therapy (n = 13) a median of 3.2 years ago (range, 2.3-5.6 y) and healthy volunteers (n = 13) were included. Cortical evoked potentials were measured. Patients had 35% lower rectal capacity at a maximum tolerable volume (p = 0.007). We found no differences in rectal cortical evoked potential latencies (p = 0.09) and amplitudes (p = 0.38) between groups. However, spectral analysis of rectal cortical evoked potentials showed a decrease in θ (4-8 Hz) and an increase in β (12-32 Hz) band activity in patients (all p < 0.001). Anal cortical potentials showed an increase in α (8-12 Hz) and β and a decrease in γ (32-70 Hz) band activity (all p < 0.001) in patients compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study of limited size. Chemoradiation therapy for distal rectal cancer causes abnormal cortical processing of both anal and rectal sensory input. Such central changes may play a role in symptomatic patients, especially when refractory to local treatments. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270. RESPUESTA NEURONAL ANORMAL A ESTÍMULOS RECTALES Y ANALES, EN PACIENTES TRATADOS POR CÁNCER RECTAL DISTAL, CON QUIMIORRADIOTERAPIA DE DOSIS ALTA, SEGUIDA DE ESPERA VIGILANTE: La espera vigilante en pacientes de cáncer rectal, con respuesta clínica completa después de la quimiorradiación, ha ganado una mayor popularidad en evitar la morbilidad y mortalidad asociadas con la cirugía.

Se compararon las latencias y amplitudes de los potenciales evocados corticales, y la amplitud relativa de cinco bandas espectrales registradas, de potenciales evocados corticales, se usaron como proxy adicional del procesamiento neuronal.Pacientes de cáncer rectal, únicamente con terapia de quimiorradiación (n = 13) mediana de 3.2 años (rango 2.3-5.6) y voluntarios sanos (n = 13).Potenciales evocados corticales.Pacientes tuvieron una capacidad rectal menor del 35%, al volumen máximo tolerable (p = 0.007). No encontramos diferencias en las latencias potenciales evocadas corticales rectales (p = 0.09) y amplitudes (p = 0.38) entre los grupos. Sin embargo, el análisis espectral de los potenciales evocados corticales rectales, mostró una disminución en theta (4-8 Hz) aumento en beta (12-32 Hz), y actividad en banda en pacientes (todos p <0.001). Los potenciales evocados corticales anales mostraron un aumento en alfa (8-12 Hz) y beta, disminución en gamma (32-70 Hz), y actividad en banda (todos p <0.001), en pacientes comparados a voluntarios sanos.Este es un estudio exploratorio de tamaño limitado.La quimiorradiación para el cáncer rectal distal, ocasiona procesos corticales sensoriales anormales anales y rectales. Tales cambios centrales pueden desempeñar un papel en pacientes sintomáticos, especialmente cuando son refractarios a tratamientos locales. Consulte Video Resumen en http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270.",

  "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss is a prevalent occupational hazard characterized by gradual, sensorineural hearing impairment, primarily affecting higher frequencies (3-6 kHz) due to prolonged exposure to excessive noise. The severity of hearing impairment is directly linked to sound pressure intensity, frequency, exposure duration, and pattern. Otolaryngologists, among other healthcare specialists, frequently use instruments that surpass safety limits, rendering them more susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss. This condition detrimentally impacts communication, performance, healthcare personnel well-being, and patient safety. This study aims to assess whether otolaryngologists and other operating room staff face a higher risk of hearing loss compared to their peers in non-surgical fields, particularly considering advances in surgical instrumentation. A case-control study conducted at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with the Otolaryngology and Audiology departments from June 2021 to December 2023. Comprehensive medical histories, physical measurements, and various audiological tests, including tympanometry, standard pure-tone audiometry, extended high-frequency pure-tone audiometry, and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOM), were administered to ensure precise results. The study included 20 otolaryngologists of varying ages and experience levels (n = 20) and a comparison group of 20 apparently healthy non-otolaryngologist medical professionals. Both groups were drawn from the same population and matched for age, socioeconomic factors, and environments. All subjects underwent extensive audiological testing for result accuracy. The mean age of otolaryngologists was 31 ± 11 years with a balanced gender distribution. In contrast, the mean age of the non-otolaryngologist group was 32 ± 10 years, with a male predominance. Otolaryngologists exhibited higher odds of low-frequency hearing loss. Additionally, most otolaryngologists displayed the absence of DPOM at 8 kHz, 9 kHz, and 10 kHz, whereas in non-otolaryngologists, DPOM was predominantly present. This study provides objective evidence of varying hearing levels among otolaryngologists and their peers in different specialties. Preventive measures should be implemented to mitigate communication challenges and enhance patient safety.",

We aim to depict the prognostic characteristics of cognition, neuroimaging, and pathology biomarkers, as well as the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia for MCI reverters. A total of 796 non-demented participants (mean age = 73.3 years, female = 54.4%, MCI = 55.7%), who were divided into MCI reverters (n = 109), stable MCI (n = 334), and stable NC (n = 353) based on 2-year diagnosis changes, were subsequently followed up for 6 years. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to assess the AD dementia hazard. Linear mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the differences in changing rates of cognitive scores, brain volumes, brain metabolism, and AD biomarkers among three groups. The 2-year MCI reversion rate was 18.17%. MCI reversion was associated with an 89.6% lower risk of AD dementia (HR = 0.104, 95% confidence interval = [0.033, 0.335], p < 0.001) than stable MCI. No significant difference in incident AD risk was found between MCI reverters and stable NC (p = 0.533). Compared to stable MCI, reverters exhibited slower decreases in cognitive performance (false discovery rate corrected p value [FDR-Q] < 0.050), brain volumes (FDR-Q < 0.050), brain metabolism (FDR-Q < 0.001), and levels of cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid  (FDR-Q = 0.008). The above-mentioned differences were not found between MCI reverters and stable NC (FDR-Q > 0.050). Reversion from MCI to NC predicts a favorable prognosis of pathological, neurodegenerative, and cognitive trajectory.",

  "abstract": "Health care costs and wait times for colorectal cancer treatment are increasing in Canada, but the association between the 2 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between wait times and health care costs and utilization. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study. This study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014 were sorted and ranked into quintiles based on the time from index contact for a colorectal cancer-related symptom to first treatment. The primary outcome is risk-adjusted health care costs, and the secondary outcomes include health care utilization and overall mortality. We included a total of 6936 patients. Total wait times ranged between 0 and 762 days. In comparison with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly increased costs (short: mean cost ratio 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32; moderate: mean cost ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; long: mean cost ratio 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.64; and very long: mean cost ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Compared with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly lower risk of mortality (short: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; moderate: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80; long: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; very long: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85). The median number of pretreatment radiological and endoscopic investigations and surgeon clinic visits increased over the study period across all wait time categories. This is a nonrandomized, retrospective cohort study with potentially limited generalizability. Patients with very short and short wait times are likely those diagnosed with life-threatening complications of colorectal cancer. Outside this window, patients with longer wait times experience increased health care costs and utilization with similar overall mortality. Improved care coordination and patient navigation may help contain the increasing wait times and associated increasing health care costs and utilization.

  "abstract": "Leukoplakia, a common type of oral dysplasia, is simply defined as a white patch in the mouth or other mucosal surface. Oral dysplasia is the most common premalignancy in the oral cavity and yet it is insufficiently researched and thus both diagnosing and treating oral dysplasia are still problematic issues. This study focuses on the immune signature of oral dysplasia and explores whether stimulating the immune system with an immune therapy, vidutolimod (± immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)), can prevent the progression of oral dysplasia or even cause regression. Vidutolimod, a virus-like particle encapsulating G10, is believed to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) through the activation of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). To investigate this, an established murine model for inducing oral cancer was used to study oral dysplasia development and response to in situ injection of vidutolimod at the premalignant phase. The effect of treatment was analyzed histologically and immunologically. ELISA revealed significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, and TNF-α in the sera of mice after 24 h of one treatment with vidutolimod + ICB as well as increased levels of proliferating T cells and pDCs in draining lymph nodes 72 h after the third and final treatment, thus indicating the immune-boosting effect of this therapy. Vidutolimod + ICB caused a significant decrease in Ki-67 expression by epithelial cells in the lesion area compared to untreated mice, implicating that this treatment regime may prevent lesion progression.",

There is a need to find miRNAs and other target genes to reduce mortality rates. The current study aims to find potential miRNAs and target genes among MI patients, MI patients with pre-diabetes (metformin non-users), and MI patients with diabetes (metformin users).MethodThe candidate miRNAs were identified by microarray profiling, and their differential expression was evaluated through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in control and patient groups. The potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a were retrieved from the TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRDB databases. The sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.ResultsMicroarray profiling identified 16 miRNAs with significantly altered expression in all MI patient groups compared with healthy controls. According to this data, two miR-1 and miR-133a (with a high ratio) were selected for further verification. All patient groups exhibited a significant increase in the expression levels of miR-1 and miR-133a. Also, miR-1 and miR-133a levels were lower in metformin-user patients than in non-user patients (  < 0.05). Moreover, interleukins, growth factors, and other related genes were identified as potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) was 0.973 (95% CI: 0.718-0.884) for circulating miR-1, and 0.969 (95% CI: 0.723-0.876) for miR-133a in patients with diabetes (  < 0.001).ConclusionPrediction of miRNA profiles and network of target genes are valuable in the early diagnosis of MI in individuals without and with diabetes. Metformin treatment is associated with lower expression of MI-related miRNAs, suggesting a potential mechanism for cardiac protection by this agent.",

  "abstract": "Data on the proportion of patients liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and the prognosis of those who have undergone IMV are limited. Objective data on prognosis are important when discussing preference for IMV. Therefore, this study explored both the proportion of liberation and prognosis after IMV in older patients in Japan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using claim data from April 2014 to March 2019 from the National Health Insurance, Late Elders' Health Insurance, and Long-Term Care Insurance in Tsukuba City, Japan. Patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent IMV were included, and patients who died within 3 days after intubation were excluded. A descriptive analysis of the liberation and the discharge status on day 180 was conducted including a stratification by age categories and care level (CL) < 3 or ≥ 3. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test was conducted to assess whether liberation and discharge status differed among age categories or CLs. In total, 272 patients were included in the study, and the median age was 78 years (interquartile range: 73-84). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 9.0 days. Pneumonia was the most frequent main diagnosis (12.5%). In total, 73.5% achieved liberation and 42.6% were discharged alive until day 180, while 19.9% were hospitalized and 37.5% were deceased on day 180. The proportion of liberation did not differ among age categories and CLs. However, the IMV duration for those requiring CL ≥ 3 was longer, and the proportion of hospitalized patients on day 180 among patients requiring CL ≥ 3 was significantly higher than that in patients requiring CL < 3 (35.1% vs 17.4%, p = 0.012). This study shows that many older patients can be successfully liberated from IMV. However, one third of patients died in the hospital and one fifth of patients required prolonged hospitalization. IMV and hospitalization were likely to be longer among patients requiring CL ≥ 3. Therefore, it may be important to discuss not only the potential difficulty of liberation, but also to convey the risks of undesired outcomes and physical function decline when considering IMV.",

  "abstract": "Early detection of postoperative recurrence is beneficial for patients with cancer; however, optimal surveillance remains an issue. To optimize the follow-up plan, the estimation of an individual patient's risk of recurrence is indispensable. This study aimed to establish a statistical model for predicting the risk of organ-specific recurrence after curative resection of colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral hospital. This study included 1720 patients with colon cancer treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical charts. The risk score was developed using a competing risk model in a derivation cohort (973 patients treated in 1997-2009) and then validated in a validation cohort (747 patients treated in 2010-2015). Patients who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon cancer were included. The prediction of the incidence of postoperative liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer was measured. The factors selected for the prediction model for liver metastasis included differentiation, T category, venous invasion, N category, and preoperative CEA level. The model for lung metastasis included sex, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, N category, preoperative CEA level, and malignant bowel obstruction. During external validation, the area under the curve at 60 months was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for liver metastasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.81) for lung metastasis. The generalizability of the model to different healthcare settings remains to be elucidated. We developed a prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence in the liver and lung after curative resection of colon cancer, which demonstrated good discrimination ability in the external validation cohort. Our model can aid clinicians and patients in customizing postoperative surveillance according to an individual patient's risk of organ-specific recurrence.

  "abstract": "NAG-1/GDF15, a tumor suppressor, is synthesized as a pro-form in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and undergoes cleavage to generate its mature form. While the biological function of pro-NAG-1/GDF15 remains unclear, our study reveals its crucial role in suppressing oncogenic signaling. We demonstrate that pro-NAG-1/GDF15 is predominantly retained within cells, whereas its mature form is secreted into the media. The expression of NAG-1/GDF15, or uncleavable R193A mutant, inhibits β-catenin and NF-κB signaling, key pathways in CRC progression. Mechanistically, the pro-NAG-1/GDF15 interacts with EpCAM, preventing its cleavage and nuclear translocation, thereby reducing β-catenin and NF-κB activity. This inhibition correlates with decreased expression of oncogenic targets such as cyclin D1 and c-myc. In vivo, NAG-1/GDF15 expression significantly reduces tumor growth in cancer xenograft models, accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, analysis of public datasets suggests that high NAG-1/GDF15 expression is associated with improved CRC patient survival. These findings highlight NAG-1/GDF15 via the formation of pro-NAG-1/GDF15 as a promising therapeutic target for cancer, with potential applications in modulating tumorigenic signaling pathways.",

  "abstract": "To assess the associations between cerebral vessels morphological features, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and the one-year risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. A total of 677 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke from January 2018 to April 2021 were consecutively enrolled. Head computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance imaging including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), were obtained on admission. Cerebral vessels morphological features such as volume, length, radius, density, tortuosity, branch complexity, and degree of stenosis were extracted and calculated using CTA data. Additionally, automated segmentation was employed for delineating WMHs lesions based on FLAIR images. By incorporating clinical characteristics, six predictive models were developed using Cox proportional hazards analysis to estimate the one-year risk of stroke recurrence. The performance of these models was evaluated by comparing the concordance index (C-index). The study found significant associations between the lack of antiplatelet therapy at discharge, reduced length and branching of cerebral vessels, and increased burden of WMHs, with a higher one-year risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (all P < 0.05). The integrated model demonstrated superior prognostic capability (C-index: 0.750; 95% CI: 0.684-0.817), outperforming models based solely on clinical characteristics (C-index: 0.636; 95% CI: 0.555-0.717), cerebral vessels morphology (C-index: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.526-0.676), and WMHs burden (C-index: 0.680; 95% CI: 0.603-0.757). The quantitative assessment of cerebral vessels morphological features and WMHs provides a promising neuroimaging tool for estimating the one-year risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. The incorporation of cerebral vessels morphological features enhances the predictive accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Biopsies are routinely obtained in the workup of large colorectal polyps before endoscopic resection. This study aimed to examine how reliable biopsies are in terms of reflecting the true histopathology of large colorectal polyps, in the clinical routine. This is a retrospective study. Data from patients undergoing polypectomy of large colorectal polyps at the endoscopy unit, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, between January 2014 and December 2016 were scrutinized. A total of 485 colorectal lesions were biopsied within 1 year before complete endoscopic removal. Biopsy-obtained specimens were compared with completely resected specimens in terms of concordance and discordance and if the final result was upgraded or downgraded. The primary outcome measured was the concordance between biopsy-obtained specimens and completely resected specimens. Median lesion size was 3 cm (range 1-11). In 189 cases (39%), biopsies did not provide a correct dysplastic grade compared with final pathology after complete resection. One hundred forty-three cases (29%) and 46 cases (9%) were upgraded and downgraded. The percentage of cases with discordant biopsy results was 40% in cases with 1 biopsy taken and 38% in cases where multiple biopsies had been sampled. Time from biopsy to complete resection did not influence the erroneous outcome of biopsies. Notably, the percentage of discordant biopsy results was 37% and 35% in lesions measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm. However, this percentage increased to 48% in colorectal lesions larger than 4 cm. This study was designed to reflect the clinical routine, the number of biopsies obtained and forceps technique were hence not standardized, which constitutes a limitation. This study demonstrates that cancer-negative forceps biopsies of large colorectal polyps, referred for endoscopic resection, are not reliable. Considering that endoscopic resection of lesions containing superficial cancer is plausible, the clinical value of forceps biopsies in lesions suitable for endoscopic resection is questionable.

LAS BIOPSIAS CON FÓRCEPS NO SON CONFIABLES EN EL ESTUDIO DE LAS LESIONES COLORRECTALES GRANDES REFERIDAS PARA RESECCIÓN ENDOSCÓPICA: ¿DEBERÍAN ABANDONARSE?: Las biopsias se obtienen de forma rutinaria en el estudio de pólipos colorrectales grandes previo a resección endoscópica. Analizar que tan confiables son las biopsias en cuanto a reflejar la verdadera histopatología de los pólipos colorrectales grandes, en la rutina clínica. DISEÑO:: Este es un estudio retrospectivo. Los datos de pacientes sometidos a polipectomía de pólipos colorrectales grandes en la unidad de endoscopia, en Skåne University Hospital Malmö, entre enero de 2014 y diciembre de 2016 fueron examinados. Un total de 485 lesiones colorrectales se biopsiaron dentro de un año antes de la resección endoscópica completa. Las muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia se compararon con las muestras completas resecadas en términos de concordancia y discordancia, y si el resultado final ascendió o disminuyó de categoría. Concordancia entre muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia y muestras completamente resecadas. La mediana de tamaño de lesiones fue de 3 cm (rango 1-11). En 189 casos (39%) las biopsias no proporcionaron un grado de displasia correcto en comparación con la patología final después de la resección completa. 143 casos (29%) y 46 casos (9%) ascendieron y descendieron de categoría, respectivamente. El porcentaje de casos con resultados de biopsia discordantes fue del 40% en los casos con una sola biopsia tomada y del 38% en los casos en los que se tomaron múltiples biopsias. El tiempo desde la biopsia hasta la resección completa no influyó en el resultado erróneo de las biopsias. Notablemente, el porcentaje de resultados de biopsia discordantes fue de 37% y 35% en lesiones que midieron 1-2 cm y 2-4 cm, respectivamente. Sin embargo, este porcentaje aumentó a 48% en lesiones colorrectales mayores de 4 cm. Este estudio se diseñó para reflejar la rutina clínica, el número de biopsias obtenidas y la técnica de fórceps no fueron estandarizadas, lo que constituye una limitación. Este estudio demuestra que las biopsias con fórceps negativas a cáncer, de pólipos colorrectales grandes referidas para resección endoscópica, no son confiables. Teniendo en cuenta que la resección endoscópica de lesiones que contienen cáncer superficial es posible, el valor clínico de las biopsias con fórceps en lesiones aptas para la resección endoscópica es cuestionable.

  "abstract": "Desmoplastic reaction is recognized as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

Sin embargo, su importancia en el cáncer rectal localmente avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia neoadyuvante sigue sin explorarse.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronóstico de la reacción desmoplásica en muestras de pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia.DISEÑO:Este es un estudio retrospectivo.ESCENARIO:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un solo centro oncológico integral.PACIENTES:El estudio incluyó a 255 pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado que se sometieron a quimiorradioterapia basada en fluoropirimidina seguida de una escisión mesorrectal total entre 2005 y 2014. La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó en categorías madura, intermedia e inmadura según el análisis histológico.RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES:Los resultados primarios fueron la supervivencia sin recurrencia y la supervivencia general. RESULTADOS: La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó como madura (69,0%), intermedia (5,5%) o inmadura (25,5%). El grupo maduro tuvo un mayor porcentaje de buenos respondedores (34,1%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (0%) e inmaduro (4,6%) (p < 0,0001). El grupo maduro se correlacionó con mejores resultados, con una mayor supervivencia libre de recurrencia a 5 años (85,4%) y supervivencia general (93,0%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (45,1% y 76,2%, respectivamente) e inmaduro (65,8% y 88,8%, respectivamente). En el análisis multivariable, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció significativamente con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia ( p = 0,03). Entre los malos respondedores, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia (p = 0,03). La quimioterapia adyuvante no mejoró significativamente la tasa de supervivencia sin recurrencia a 5 años para el grupo maduro (quimioterapia adyuvante vs. ninguna quimioterapia, 86,4% vs. 84,8%; p = 0,64), observándose tendencias peores en el grupo combinado intermedio/inmaduro (55,9% vs. 69,4%, respectivamente, p = 0,27).LIMITACIONES:Las limitaciones incluyen la naturaleza subjetiva de la evaluación de la reacción desmoplásica y el diseño retrospectivo del estudio.CONCLUSIONES:La reacción desmoplásica en muestras quirúrgicas después de la quimiorradioterapia se asocia con respuestas a la quimiorradioterapia y sirve como un factor pronóstico significativo en el cáncer rectal avanzado, particularmente para aquellos que responden mal a la quimiorradioterapia.

  "abstract": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a prevalent knee condition in physically active individuals, with a multifactorial etiology. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of lumbopelvic stabilization in treating patients with PFPS. The study involved 28 PFPS patients and 28 healthy controls, all aged between 18 and 45 years. Sociodemographic data were collected, and measurements were taken using ultrasonography (USG) to assess muscle thickness of the transverse abdominis (TrA) and multifidus lumborum (ML), as well as static and dynamic endurance of the trunk muscles in both groups. Pain levels were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and knee function was assessed using the Kujala Patellofemoral Rating Questionnaire (KPSQ). The TrA and ML muscle thicknesses were symmetrical and statistically similar in both the PFPS and control groups at rest and during contraction (p > 0.05). However, significant differences were found between the muscle thicknesses of the PFPS and control groups for both the right (p < 0.01) and left sides (p < 0.01), both at rest and during contraction. Additionally, significant differences were observed in the dynamic and static trunk endurance tests between the PFPS and control groups (p < 0.001). Pain levels and knee functionality also differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001). The findings of this study indicate that individuals with PFPS exhibited differences in the thickness of the TrA and ML muscles compared to asymptomatic controls, suggesting potential lumbopelvic involvement in PFPS pathology.",

  "abstract": "Numerous techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been described. The present study aims to determine the proportion of wrists with CTS in which the application of DN avoids surgery. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial clinical trial was performed. Eighty-six wrists with diagnosis of mild or moderate CTS and indication for surgery were recruited from a hospital traumatology service. The intervention group was treated with DN, with a frequency of one session/week over six weeks, while the control group did not follow any specific treatment, remaining on the waiting list for the surgery. The main variable was the recommendation for surgery. Other secondary variables included changes in electromyography and ultrasound; intensity of pain; Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ); hand dynamometries; and possible adverse effects. The wrists treated by DN had a reduced risk of needing surgery at 12 weeks by 62% compared to the control group (RR = 0.38, 95% CI[0.2-0.72]), with this value being significant (p-value = 0.003). This group also obtained a significant improvement in the intensity of pain (p-value = 0.006), and in the BCTQ-severity of syntoms scale and BCTQ-functional situation scale (p-value = 0.039 and p-value = 0.019 respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in the dynamometries performed, nor in the results of the electromyography and ultrasound studies. Adverse effects were infrequent or unimportant. Application of DN to wrists with mild or moderate CTS reduces the need for surgery, and improves the clinical symptoms and functionality of the hand.",

  "abstract": "ObjectivePatients with diabetes are 3-5 times higher at risk for cardiovascular diseases and myocardial infarction (MI). There is a need to find miRNAs and other target genes to reduce mortality rates. The current study aims to find potential miRNAs and target genes among MI patients, MI patients with pre-diabetes (metformin non-users), and MI patients with diabetes (metformin users).MethodThe candidate miRNAs were identified by microarray profiling, and their differential expression was evaluated through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in control and patient groups. The potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a were retrieved from the TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRDB databases. The sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.ResultsMicroarray profiling identified 16 miRNAs with significantly altered expression in all MI patient groups compared with healthy controls. According to this data, two miR-1 and miR-133a (with a high ratio) were selected for further verification. All patient groups exhibited a significant increase in the expression levels of miR-1 and miR-133a. Also, miR-1 and miR-133a levels were lower in metformin-user patients than in non-user patients (  < 0.05). Moreover, interleukins, growth factors, and other related genes were identified as potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) was 0.973 (95% CI: 0.718-0.884) for circulating miR-1, and 0.969 (95% CI: 0.723-0.876) for miR-133a in patients with diabetes (  < 0.001).ConclusionPrediction of miRNA profiles and network of target genes are valuable in the early diagnosis of MI in individuals without and with diabetes. Metformin treatment is associated with lower expression of MI-related miRNAs, suggesting a potential mechanism for cardiac protection by this agent.",

  "abstract": "Emerging trials demonstrate that neuromodulation, especially spinal cord stimulation, improves function for those with chronic spinal cord injury. Their design - uncontrolled and unblinded - is justified by the claim that sham conditions are unethical and/or impossible. In the absence of controlled trials, the functional benefits of spinal cord stimulation cannot be distinguished from the effects of placebo. To discuss the validity of the claim that placebo control conditions are infeasible in spinal cord stimulation research, and to propose feasible solutions for including sham conditions that would account for placebo effects. Placebo effects are likely to occur in spinal cord stimulation studies, given the high levels of participant expectations of an effect, natural fluctuations in symptoms associated with spinal cord injury, regression towards the mean, the Hawthorne effect, presence of concurrent interventions, and the absence of blinding in existing studies. Options for placebo control conditions could include adding an \"untreated\" control group, using \"placebo-resistant\" outcomes, adding an active comparator group or sham stimulation, or investing in parasthesia-free stimulation. Additionally, wherever feasible, blinding of both participants and assessors should be pursued. The current evidence base for spinal cord stimulation is undermined by the lack of rigorous sham controls, and the argument that such controls are unethical or unfeasible do not withstand scrutiny. We propose strategies for the inclusion of placebo controls in future trials and encourage investigators to prioritize these approaches to ensure the true benefit of spinal cord stimulation can be determined.",

  "abstract": "Although it is well-documented that robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can improve surgical precision, evaluations of the postoperative kinematics of patients implanted using robotics remain less common. The objective of this study is to analyze the weight-bearing kinematics for multiple TKAs implanted using two different surgical robots. In vivo knee kinematics were assessed using fluoroscopy for 28 subjects implanted with a Bi-Cruciate Stabilized (BCS) TKA, 23 with a Bi-Cruciate Retaining (BCR) TKA, 13 with a posterior stabilized (PS) TKA, and 22 with a cruciate retaining (CR) TKA. All subjects were implanted by the same surgeon using the respective company's surgical robot. All subjects performed a weight-bearing deep knee bend. Parameters of interest include the femoral condylar anterior/posterior motion, femorotibial axial rotation, and weight-bearing range-of-motion. The BCS TKA experienced the most posterior rollback, 13.4 ± 4.4 mm for the lateral condyle and 5.8 ± 2.5 mm for the medial condyle. These subjects also experienced the most femorotibial axial rotation, +9.3 ± 5.3°. Conversely, CR subjects experienced the least overall rollback and most anterior sliding, 0.4 ± 3.8 mm of lateral rollback and 1.9 ± 4.1 mm of medial anterior sliding. Implant design appears to play a significant role in postoperative kinematics. Improved stability is evident in TKAs that account for the ACL. However, no system behaved significantly better nor worse than previously published literature evaluating standard instrumentation. Level of Evidence: Level 3, retrospective cohort study.",

A multiple-threshold meta-analysis and standard bivariate meta-analysis were used. This meta-analysis included 14 studies comprising 25 528 follicles. Results showed follicle size is predictive for oocyte developmental competence, including oocyte maturity (area under the receiver operation characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.77; n = 24 116; follicle size ≥ 15 mm), normal fertilisation (0.62, 0.55-0.69; n = 25 321; follicle size ≥ 16 mm), blastocyst formation (0.61, 0.53-0.69; n = 12 859; follicle size ≥ 15 mm) and good-quality embryo (0.64, 0.54-0.71; n = 16 631; follicle size ≥ 16 mm) per oocyte. Based on per mature oocyte or two-pronuclei zygote, follicle size showed little predictive capacity for embryological parameters. Follicle size could predict oocyte developmental competence with corresponding optimal thresholds identified. However, the benefits for embryological fate may plateau at follicle sizes ≥ 15-16 mm once the oocytes achieve maturation or fertilisation.",

  "abstract": "The mechanism of the lipid paradox remains uncertain, and malnutrition may be 1 explanation. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the associations between baseline remnant cholesterol (RC) concentrations and clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke, stratified by nutritional status. Patients with ischemic stroke in a single-center prospective cohort (Shanghai, China) from January 2018 to December 2022 were studied. Individuals were classified into 3 groups based on their Controlling Nutritional Status score. Poor outcome and all-cause mortality during up to 3 months of follow-up were compared among patients with varied nutritional status and RC levels utilizing multivariate logistic regression analyses, RC splines, and subgroup analyses. A total of 6892 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the cohort, of which 5257 patients were included in the present study (without malnutrition: 2418 [46.0%]; mild malnutrition: 2516 [47.9%]; moderate-severe malnutrition: 323 [6.1%]). The median age was 69±12 years, and 3398 (64.6%) were male. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition had the highest risks of poor outcome (198 [61.3%];  <0.001) and all-cause mortality (106 [32.8%];  <0.001) during the 3-month follow-up. A higher baseline RC level was an independent protective factor for adverse outcomes in patients with any degree of malnutrition ( <0.05), which was not observed in patients without malnutrition. In addition, compared with the moderate-severely malnourished with RC <0.471 mmol/L, the adjusted odds ratios for poor outcome and all-cause mortality were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.450-1.438) and 0.898 (0.502-1.607) for participants with 0.471 to 0.632 mmol/L, 0.259 (0.095-0.704) and 0.222 (0.061-0.810) for 0.633 to 0.868 mmol/L, and 0.160 (0.037-0.689) and 0.202 (0.042-0.967) for ≥0.869 mmol/L, respectively. The lipid paradox was only observed in the malnourished patients with ischemic stroke. Strict lipid reduction therapy is still recommended for patients without malnutrition.

This study aims to assess the frequency of new hip problems, including pain and HD progression, as well as the need for additional hip surgery following scoliosis correction in neuromuscular patients, and to identify predictive factors for these issues. This retrospective study included 71 neuromuscular patients (142 hips) who underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) at a specialized center between 2015 and 2022. Clinical data such as age, sex, underlying pathology, ambulatory status, and prior hip surgeries were collected. Radiological parameters, including curve characteristics, coronal imbalance, Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity (PO), and migration percentage (MP), were measured pre- and post-operatively. Descriptive, comparative, and multivariate analyses, including logistic regression, were performed to identify significant predictors and determine optimal cutoff points. The mean age of patients was 15 ± 2 years, with 59% female and 84.5% nonambulatory. After scoliosis surgery, 15.5% of hips developed new hip problems: 20 hips experienced pain and 9 had HD progression, with 7 requiring additional surgery (3 reconstructive and 4 palliative). Factors including a preoperative up-hip and increased MP, with a cutoff > 25%, were strong predictors of hip pain. HD progression was linked to a postoperative up-hip and increased MP, with MP > 60% emerging as a critical predictor. The need for additional hip surgery was associated with cerebral palsy (CP) and with increased MP. Approximately 1 in 7 hips developed new-onset problems following PSF in neuromuscular patients. Factors including a preoperative up-hip and increased MP were significant predictors of adverse outcomes, underscoring the importance of thorough preoperative assessment, personalized surgical planning, and proactive counseling regarding potential postoperative complications.

Most clinical practice guidelines from medical professional societies do not recommend routine PGx testing, with a few key exceptions. Inconsistent recommendations across clinical practice guidelines, FDA product labeling, and payer reimbursement policies have hampered widespread adoption of testing. Multiple resources exist to aid in the adoption and use of actionable PGx test results in clinical practice; however, most of these resources do not provide guidance on who should receive PGx testing and when-a critical question the clinical community continues to struggle with. There are multiple considerations when answering this question beyond the clinical validity of the drug-gene interaction itself, such as the actionable result frequency, severity of the adverse clinical outcome, predictive power of the PGx test, suitability of alternative treatments, cost, and turnaround time of test results. This perspective discusses these considerations and models for testing including preemptive screening, pretreatment testing, and reactive testing, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The authors provide their perspectives on identifying candidates for PGx testing in the current real-world environment and how that differs from a clinically ideal scenario.",

  "abstract": "Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia globally after Alzheimer's disease, is associated with neuroinflammation. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an important pattern recognition receptor in human innate immunity, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway destroys neuronal cells primarily through the production of IL-18 and IL-1β. Moreover, it exacerbates vascular dementia by producing IL-18, IL-1β, and the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD, which also contributes to neuronal cell death. Thus, blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway presents a new therapeutic strategy for treating vascular dementia, thereby delaying or curing the disease more effectively and mitigating adverse effects. This review explores the role and mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vascular dementia, summarizing current research and therapeutic strategies. Investigating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can reveal the pathogenesis of vascular dementia from a new perspective and propose innovative preventive and treatment strategies.",

When a fracture of the acromion occurs, despite being rare, matching the best-fit fixation plate is challenging due to few options and limited availability of fixation plate types. Alternative fixation methods can carry risk of nonunion complications. The objective of this study was to investigate the morphological curvature pattern of the acromion to assess the level of the fixation plates fitness and provide the suitable imaging modalities for evaluating the acromion curvature. The correlation between the acromion curvature and five fixation plates were calculated and their fitness level was evaluated statistically. The curvature of acromion and the five available fixation plates were photographed and assessed digitally by software (FIJI ImageJ and Microsoft Excel). The method entails plotting seven points along the curving surface and margins of the acromion, while the Excel Solver function calculates the regression, ultimately giving curvature values. First, the acromion parameters were studied on 180 paired healthy dry scapulae. Then, the acromion curvature values were compared to the fixation plates curvatures. Likewise, the acromion curvature was assessed as applicable on 153 (100 AP- views, 50 Y- views, and 3 superior-views) retrospective plain X-rays and 40 3D-CT scapula reconstructions of healthy acromia. The mean length of the acromion was 48.70 ± 5.29mm, mean thickness was 8.51 ± 1.67mm, and mean width was 25.97 ± 5.97mm. The calculated values of the mean curvatures were 0.050 ± 0.015mm  for the mean acromion surface, 0.042 ± 0.027mm  for the internal margin, and 0.055 ± 0.010mm  for the external margin. The curved geometry of the acromion was plotted on a graph giving a spectrum of curvature patterns with distribution values revealing fixation plates fitness represented by area under the curve with frequencies of 4.32% for the acromion-specific fixation plate, 14.28% for the large clavicle fixation plate, 0.26% for the small clavicle fixation plate, 53.38% for the flexible universal fixation plate, and none for the rigid universal fixation plate. Approximately 27.76% of the acromion surface curvatures distribution does not overlap with any of our measured fixation plates. Evaluating the acromion surface curvature was possible on plain X-rays in the Y-view only.",

  "abstract": "Genetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients are usually conducted in small or regional studies; there is currently a lack of research on whether genetic abnormalities in each continent have regional specificity. In this study, we collected and jointly analysed studies published between 1995 and 2023 that reported on molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities of AML patients. Our findings reveal that the incidence of molecular genetic abnormalities has been increasing annually, whereas cellular genetic abnormalities show an overall declining trend. We performed cluster analysis and developed a prognostic risk model to uncover that AML patients with molecular genetic abnormalities, or both types of genetic abnormalities, have a relatively lower risk in Europe. In contrast, AML patients in Asia with cytogenetic abnormalities exhibit a comparatively lower risk. We also found that spliceosome co-mutations were dominant among molecular genetic abnormalities, but the synergistic correlation between cytogenetic abnormalities is minimal. Our study offers valuable insights in AML risk levels across different regions, based on prognostic classification and regional risk stratification, and underscores the clinical significance of gene mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and their co-occurrence, highlighting their role in understanding the disease's pathogenesis and informing treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis can occur due to many traumatic and nontraumatic causes. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in new type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of rhabdomyolysis on mortality and renal outcomes in patients hospitalized in our hospital's COVID-19 wards. In our single-center and retrospective study, we included patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 by a thorax-computed tomography finding who were older than 18 years of age and with a measured creatinine kinase (CK) > 1000 U/L on any day of hospitalization. The same number of patients hospitalized in COVID-19 services with CK < 1000 U/L and with similar gender and age were determined as the control group. We analyzed the data of 2065 patients, and compared 154 patients in the rhabdomyolysis group (group 1) and 154 patients in the control group (group 2). Acute kidney injury (AKI) (44.2% vs 21.4%; P < .001), intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (53.2% vs 13.6%; P < .001), intubation (75.6% vs 23.8%; P < .001), mortality (36.4% vs 3.2%; P < .001) and the need for dialysis (3.9% vs 0.6%; P = .005) were seen more in the rhabdomyolysis group. When that group was divided into the early rhabdomyolysis group (group 1a), where the CK value reached its highest value in ≤3 days, and the late rhabdomyolysis group (group 1b), where it was ≥ 4 days, AKI (29.7% vs 65.1%; P < .001), ICU (35.2% vs 79.4%; P < .001), intubation (56.2% vs 88%; P = .001), mortality (18% vs 61.9%; P < .001), and dialysis (1.1% vs 7.9%; P = .031), the results were higher in the group 1b. The available data suggest that rhabdomyolysis seen in COVID-19 patients is not a direct predictor of mortality and poor renal outcomes, but is a secondary outcome to multiple-organ failure caused by worsening clinical status.",

However, mechanical tumor ablation requires highly intense FUS pulses, which may generate off-target effects. In addition, residual cancer cells that survive ablation can cause recurrence. To overcome these challenges, we developed a dual-functional nanomaterial by assembling peptide amphiphiles on hydrophobically modified nanoparticles. The hydrophobic nanoparticle core allows for the generation of cavitating bubbles at low FUS intensities to effectively ablate tumors. Peptide amphiphile shells interact dynamically with the hydrophobic nanoparticle surfaces and cell membranes, which improved tumor retention and cellular internalization of payloads attached to them. By conjugating a highly potent agent, Monomethyl auristatin E, to the peptide amphiphiles, we showed synergistic mechano- and chemotherapy using   and   models of human melanoma.

This study explores associations of artificial intelligence (AI)-based skeletal muscle assessment with hematologic toxicity and chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) in adults with mCRC receiving standard combination chemotherapy.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of adults with mCRC receiving first-line FOLFOX or FOLFIRI over 6 months (≤12 cycles) from 1/2011 to 11/2018. We used a validated AI-based skeletal muscle assessment on baseline (prior to starting chemotherapy) computed tomography scans to determine skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm /m ), categorizing low SMI using independent sex-specific cut-off values. We sought to evaluate the association between low SMI and the incidence of grade ≥3 (G ≥ 3) cytopenia over 6 months. Secondary endpoints included time to G ≥ 3 cytopenia and RDI.ResultsOverall, 126 adults met inclusion (median age = 61 years [range, 29-85]; 56 [44%] female) with a median BMI of 26.6 kg/m  (IQR, 24.1-30.5 kg/m ), including 59 (47%) with a low SMI. G ≥ 3 neutropenia incidence was higher in adults with low SMI (31% vs. 15%, p = 0.036). There was no difference for other G ≥ 3 cytopenias (39% vs 24%, p = 0.067) or median time to G ≥ 3 neutropenia (p = 0.053).

Twenty-two patients with AVN underwent core decompression and BMAI. The patients were followed for at least 12 months. Radiological assessments were performed using plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and staging was conducted based on the Association Research Circulation Osseous system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Harris Hip Score and Merle d'Aubigne-Postel scoring systems. At the 12-month follow-up, hip function scores showed significant improvement. The mean Harris Hip Score increased by 23 points (P < .001), and the mean Merle d'Aubigne-Postel score increased by 1 point (P < .001). Radiologically, all stage I lesions regressed to stage 0 (P < .001). Among stage II lesions, 83% remained stable, while progression was observed in 17%. 75% of the stage IIIA lesions showed radiological progression. Core decompression combined with BMAI effectively halts the progression of early-stage AVN, preserving joint integrity and delaying the need for total hip arthroplasty.

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring alternative approaches such as in vitro models, organoids, and computational simulations, which offer promising and ethical substitutes for animal models. Despite these developments, animal models remain indispensable for certain investigations due to their ability to replicate complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.

  "abstract": "Understanding pathological changes in the brain is essential for guiding treatment decisions in brain injuries and diseases. Despite significant advances in brain imaging techniques, clinical practice still faces challenges due to infrastructure reliance and high resource demands. This review explores the current knowledge on blood-based biomarkers that indicate brain pathology, which can assist in identifying at-risk patients, diagnosing patients, predicting disease progression, and treatment response. We focus on the inherited metabolic disorders X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) which share remarkable phenotypic variability. Disease-specific increases in the lipid metabolites lyso-PC26:0 in X-ALD and sulfatides in MLD might contribute to predicting clinical manifestation. Disease-unspecific biomarkers for axonal damage (neurofilament light chain protein, NfL) and glial degeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) are able to distinguish X-ALD and MLD phenotypes at the group level. The implementation of X-ALD into newborn screening programs in various countries, including several U.S. states, has increased the demand for predictive blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting the early conversion from the pre-symptomatic to the early neuroinflammatory cerebral form of X-ALD. Among different biomarkers, NfL has proven most effective in reflecting neuroinflammation and correlating with brain lesion volume and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based severity scores. We discuss how NfL has moved from initial proof-of-principle towards proof-of-concept studies in brain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and how this knowledge could be applied for the clinical implementation of NfL in rare inherited metabolic disorders such as X-ALD.",

While pharmacological therapies have evolved to mitigate symptoms, they fail to address the core pathology-orexin deficiency. This narrative review examines the potential of orexin cell transplantation as an innovative therapeutic approach to restore orexin signalling and treat the root cause of narcolepsy. We begin by examining the clinical features, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy, focusing on the essential role of orexins in regulating the sleep-wake cycle and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cataplexy. The review then explores experimental therapeutic approaches, including hypothalamic tissue grafts, gene therapy, and immortalised orexin-expressing cell lines, highlighting their potential to address the orexin deficit in narcolepsy. While preclinical studies show that transplanted orexin cells can integrate into host neural networks, enhance sleep stability, and decrease the frequency of cataplexy in animal models, several challenges remain. Immortalised orexin cell lines offer a scalable and consistent option for transplantation therapies. However, immune rejection, long-term cell survival, and complete functional integration persist. These translational hurdles must be addressed to bring these therapies to clinical practice. This review underscores the need for continued research to overcome these barriers and optimise cell-based therapies for narcolepsy.",

EOSQ-SELF was developed to assess HRQoL directly from patients, yet its responsiveness remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties and responsiveness of the cross-culturally adapted traditional Chinese version of EOSQ-SELF. Patients were consecutively recruited at an orthopaedic specialist clinic. Included patients must be diagnosed with EOS, aged 8 to 18 years at recruitment, and could read traditional Chinese. EOSQ-SELF underwent double-forward single-backward translations. At recruitment and at 6-month follow-up, patients completed the traditional Chinese EOSQ-SELF, refined Scoliosis Research Society-22 item (SRS-22r) questionnaire, and EuroQol-5-dimension 5-level. Psychometric properties of the EOSQ-SELF were assessed, with sensitivity analysis via known group comparison. Responsiveness was evaluated through an anchor-based approach using a global rating of change (GRC) scale. A total of 139 patients were recruited, with 132 (92.4% responsiveness) included for analyses. Traditional Chinese EOSQ-SELF has good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent, and construct validity. The EOSQ-SELF total score showed no ceiling/floor effects, correlated with SRS-22r total score (rs: 0.788, P<0.001), EQ index score (rs: 0.680, P<0.001), and EQ VAS (rs: 0.527, P<0.001). Discriminative validity was demonstrated: syndromic EOS had a lower transfer domain score (vs. idiopathic and congenital), and a lower EOSQ-SELF total score (median: 71.3 vs. idiopathic 81.1, P=0.023). On the basis of the GRC, 7.4%, 46.7%, and 45.9% of patients had worsened, unchanged, and improved overall health, respectively. The improvement group showed significantly higher EOSQ-SELF total score at 6 months (median: 83.4 vs. baseline 78.7, P=0.015), and none had total scores decrease reaching MCID. Traditional Chinese EOSQ-SELF is a reliable instrument for assessing HRQoL and its changes reported by older patients (aged 8 years or above﻿). It is sensitive in differentiating patients with improved overall health from those who are stable/worsened. EOSQ-SELF can enhance clinical care and monitoring of EOS patients through assessing their HRQoL and detecting changes effectively. Level II.",

While co-stimulatory signals play critical roles in promoting NK cell proliferation and activating their functions, the exploitation of these signals for expanding NK cells has not been fully explored. To identify the optimal engineered feeder cells for expanding umbilical cord blood-derived NK cells, we generated different feeder cells expressing the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, 4-1BBL, or membrane-bound IL-21 (mbIL21). We then evaluated the transduction efficacy of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct into expanded NK cells using various lentiviral vectors. Our results showed that CD80, in combination with 4-1BBL and mbIL21, induced the highest expansion of NK cells from cord blood.

Single-blind, Randomized clinical trial. Outpatient clinic. Sixty patients (19-38 years old) with mechanical neck pain participated in this study and were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the faculty of physical therapy after a referral from an orthopedist. Patients were randomly assigned by the opaque sealed envelope to two treatment groups: Group A Received High power pain threshold ultrasound (HPPTUS), traditional therapy in form of (active range of motion, stretching exercises, and postural correction exercises (PCES), whereas Group B Received traditional therapy only; therapeutic sessions were performed Twice/week for 4 weeks. The visual analog scale, pressure pain threshold, neck disability index, upper trapezius and Levator scapulae median frequency, and root mean square were used to evaluate the patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment status. Multiple pairwise comparisons within each group revealed statistically significant differences in all outcome variables in both groups with favor to the HPPTUS group as p = 0.0001. Between group analysis at post treatment revealed statistical significant difference between both groups in all outcome variables as p = 0.0001.

MCGRs allow noninvasive lengthenings with external lengthening device and reduce the need for surgical procedures. The association of preoperative body mass index (BMI) and the outcomes of the MCGR treatment is not well known. Prospectively collected international database was reviewed for EOS patients treated with MCGR. Patients without preoperative BMI data or follow-up <2 years were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy weight, overweight, and underweight using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Quality of life was assessed using EOSQ-24. Results were analyzed from the 2-year follow-up. A total of 663 patients were categorized into underweight (n=91), healthy weight (n=417), and overweight (n=155) groups. There were no significant differences in major curve correction or thoracic height increase among the BMI groups, irrespective of etiology. Distribution of BMI categories differed significantly by etiology (P=0.009), with lower healthy weight proportions in the syndromic group (92/167, 55%) compared with idiopathic (131/177, 74%) (adjusted P=0.004), and a higher underweight proportion in neuromuscular (36/244, 15%) compared with idiopathic (15/177, 8.5%) (adjusted P=0.044). Higher BMI z-scores were associated with an increased incidence of complications, including implant-related complications (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3) and implant breakage (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7).

Implant-related complications were less common in underweight patients compared with overweight patients (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.90). Higher BMI z-score was a significant predictor of implant breakage, whereas preoperative major curve, kyphosis, and etiology were not. EOSQ-24 scores did not differ significantly among BMI groups, and changes in scores were comparable across groups during follow-up. BMI status did not influence curve correction, thoracic height increase, or EOSQ-24 outcomes in early-onset scoliosis patients. However, the higher incidence of implant breakage in overweight patients suggests that elevated BMI should be carefully considered when planning treatment. Level III.",

  "abstract": "The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) experienced with low-level viremia (LLV) remains poorly defined. This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic utility of serum HBV RNA as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in this population. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 117 pediatric patients with LLV (mean age: 13.14 years; 34% female) treated with continuous entecavir (ConT) or modified regimens (switching to or combining with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for ≥ 120 weeks. Virological response was defined as HBV DNA < 10 IU/mL at week 120. No significant baseline differences existed between ConT and modified regimen groups. Compared to ConT, modified regimens achieved greater reductions in serum HBV DNA, HBV RNA, and quantitative HBsAg, with higher cumulative undetectable rates at week 120 (HBV DNA: ≥ 80.0%; HBV RNA: ≥ 54.8%; P < 0.05). Notably, qHBsAg levels remained elevated in most patients, with only 3 individuals achieving undetectable levels (< 0.05 IU/mL). Multivariate analysis identified higher HBV RNA levels at week 48 as an independent risk factor for non-virological response (adjusted odds ratio: 5.86; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-24.62; P = 0.016). Although HBV RNA alone was less predictive than HBV DNA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.76 vs. 0.80; P = 0.459), combining both markers improved prediction accuracy (AUC: 0.82; P < 0.05 vs. single markers). In children with LLV, serum HBV RNA level is an independent risk factor for non-virological response and may serve as a complementary biomarker to HBV DNA for guiding antiviral therapy adjustments.",

  "abstract": "Numerous techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been described. The present study aims to determine the proportion of wrists with CTS in which the application of DN avoids surgery. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial clinical trial was performed. Eighty-six wrists with diagnosis of mild or moderate CTS and indication for surgery were recruited from a hospital traumatology service. The intervention group was treated with DN, with a frequency of one session/week over six weeks, while the control group did not follow any specific treatment, remaining on the waiting list for the surgery. The main variable was the recommendation for surgery. Other secondary variables included changes in electromyography and ultrasound; intensity of pain; Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ); hand dynamometries; and possible adverse effects. The wrists treated by DN had a reduced risk of needing surgery at 12 weeks by 62% compared to the control group (RR = 0.38, 95% CI[0.2-0.72]), with this value being significant (p-value = 0.003). This group also obtained a significant improvement in the intensity of pain (p-value = 0.006), and in the BCTQ-severity of syntoms scale and BCTQ-functional situation scale (p-value = 0.039 and p-value = 0.019 respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in the dynamometries performed, nor in the results of the electromyography and ultrasound studies. Adverse effects were infrequent or unimportant. Application of DN to wrists with mild or moderate CTS reduces the need for surgery, and improves the clinical symptoms and functionality of the hand.",

  "abstract": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) significantly increase morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) being a leading HAI pathogen requiring targeted eradication in healthcare settings. The growing bacterial tolerance to chemical disinfectants, like chlorhexidine, highlights an urgent need for novel disinfection strategies. Bacteriophages, which employ unique mechanisms to lyse bacteria, offer a potential solution. Combining phages with disinfectants could reduce the use of chemical agents and delay the development of bacterial resistance. However, the use of phages for contamination control in clinical environments remains underexplored. ΦK2046 was isolated from hospital wastewater and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, one-step growth curve, optimal multiplicity of infection, and stability analysis. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify the genomic characteristics of ΦK2046. The antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of ΦK2046 combined with chlorhexidine were assessed through growth curves, time-kill assays, crystal violet staining, and scanning electron microscopy. A contaminated medical device model was established to assess the ΦK2046-chlorhexidine combination's biofilm reduction efficacy, and different dosing sequences and timing intervals were evaluated for their impact on biofilms formed on urinary catheters. ΦK2046, characterized by a short latency period, strong environmental stability, safety, and tolerance to chlorhexidine, significantly enhanced the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of chlorhexidine against FK2046, and reduce the emergence of resistant strains. In contaminated medical device models, the combination of ΦK2046 and chlorhexidine diminished bacterial load and biofilm formation on surfaces. A \"phage-first\" dosing sequence, particularly with a 90-min interval before chlorhexidine treatment, showed superior efficacy in biofilm reduction. This study, using ΦK2046 as an example, demonstrates the potential of phages to enhance the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of chlorhexidine and their feasibility in medical device disinfection. This innovative approach not only improves chlorhexidine's disinfecting power but also effectively tackles the issue of reduced susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to chlorhexidine. The research advances the development and application of phage-based disinfectants and lays a foundation for establishing a phage library with adjuvant properties for disinfectants.",

  "abstract": "Forward neck flexion (FNF) is a common postural abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD), which disturbs the overall body alignment and can lead to more severe deformities through both central nervous system control and biomechanical compensation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of forward neck muscles related to FNF in individuals with PD, both with and without FNF, in comparison to age-matched individuals with normal posture. Hand-held myotonometry (Myoton Pro®) was conducted to determine the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscles of all thirty participants: individuals with PD and FNF (n = 10), individuals with PD without FNF (n = 10), and normal controls (n = 10). Individuals with PD, both with and without FNF, exhibited higher passive tone and muscle stiffness and lower elasticity, relaxation time, and creep in both muscles, particularly in the sternocleidomastoid, compared to age-matched normal controls. No significant differences in any muscle variables were found between the two PD groups. These findings indicate that the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of neck muscles are altered even in the presymptomatic stage of postural abnormalities in PD. This may provide potential evidence of underlying peripheral factors that involve postural deformities via proprioceptive disturbances and exacerbate rigidity in PD.",
