The gut microbiome has been associated with various neurological disorders, and certain drugs greatly disturb the microbiome. Our aim was to study the association of prenatal and childhood exposure (before the age of two) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and the risk of childhood epilepsy. Using population-based registers, we included all live singleton births in Sweden from 2006 to 2017. Exposure was considered prescription(s) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or H2-receptor antagonists (separately). Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. 708,903 mother-child dyads were included, and 0.5% of children had an epilepsy diagnosis. Average follow-up was 3.8\u2009years (IQR 1-6). Prenatal exposure to antibiotics (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18) and PPIs (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.65) were associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. Exposure to antibiotics (1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21), PPIs (3.40, 95% CI 2.47-4.68) and H2RAs (1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.64) before the age of two was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy after the age of two. Dose response analysis showed that one prescription of antibiotics in pregnancy or early life was not associated with an increased risk of epilepsy, while one prescription of PPIs in pregnancy or early life had an association. To conclude, our results support the hypothesis that microbiome modulating drugs are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. This needs to be further validated in other studies, ideally including indications for drug use.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

This study aimed to analyze the impact of consolidation therapy among young patients with intracranial primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 55 young patients (age < 60 years) with intracranial primary DLBCL who achieved complete remission (CR) after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based chemotherapy from March 2001 to October 2021. Among these patients, 33 patients received consolidation therapy, and 22 patients did not. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between the two groups via Kaplan-Meier analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards method, and propensity score matching (PSM). The median follow-up time was 60.1 months. A total of 13 patients (23.6%) died, and 20 patients (36.4%) experienced recurrence. Patients who received consolidation therapy had higher 2-year OS (96.8% vs. 71.1%,   = 0.036) and DFS (90.9% vs. 56.4%,   = 0.006) rates than those without consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis after PSM revealed that consolidation therapy was an independent predictor of DFS (HR = 0.282, 95% CI = 0.084-0.942,   = 0.040). Furthermore, rituximab was an independent predictor of favorable OS, and performance status was an independent predictor of OS and DFS. Subgroup analysis showed rituximab significantly improved OS in patients without consolidation therapy (88.9% vs. 45.0%,   = 0.006), but not in those with consolidation therapy (95.0% vs. 100%,   = 0.528). Consolidation therapy improved DFS in young intracranial primary DLBCL patients achieving CR after HD-MTX-based chemotherapy. Autologous stem cell transplantation and radiotherapy showed comparable consolidation benefits. Good performance status correlated with favorable outcomes. Adding rituximab to induction chemotherapy may improve OS in patients without consolidation therapy, but it might be unnecessary for those eligible for consolidation. Further research involving a larger patient cohort is warranted to ascertain rituximab's efficacy.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

The HLCS gene has been identified as the source of pathogenic mutations associated with this condition. Cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency is another rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defects in cobalamin metabolism, attributable to mutations in the MMACHC gene. This disorder often leads to methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria and is classified into early-onset and late-onset types. The late-onset type is characterized by acute or chronic progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To date, there have been no documented cases worldwide of individuals diagnosed with both HCSD and cobalamin C deficiency. This report details the case of an 11-year-and-9-month-old female patient from China who presented with symptoms including vomiting, altered consciousness, and a rash. Laboratory evaluations indicated the presence of metabolic acidosis, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in the MMACHC gene: c.482G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.R161Q) and c.567dup (p.I190Yfs\u221713).

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with MS.   Using valid keywords and searching through databases like Medlib, ScienceDirect, PubMed, etc., 10 articles published between 1999 and 2020 were collected. The inclusion criteria were developed based on clinical guidelines, focusing on studies involving adults with MS treated with IFN-\u03b2, with outcomes measuring QOL. The exclusion criteria included studies not in English, those involving pediatric populations, or those lacking a control group. In the reviewed studies, 14 scales of QOL were measured at the beginning and the end of treatment with IFN-\u03b2. The data were analyzed using the random effects model meta-analysis method with R software and Stata software. Publication bias was not significant. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q test and the I  index. In heterogeneous studies, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used for meta-analysis. The random-effect model was used for analyses with I  of more than 50%.   A total number of 1320 people with an average age of 32.40 \u00b1 8.77 years were included in this study. On average, there was a slight decline in energy and satisfaction with sexual function scales (SSF), while a slight improvement was seen in the other 12 scales, following the treatment with IFN-\u03b2. However, no significant changes were observed in any of the QOL scales following treatment, except for health distress (HD) (P < 0.001), role limitation due to physical problems (RLPP) (P < 0.001), and role limitation due to emotional problems (RLEP) (P = 0.037), all of which showed a slight but natable improvement.

The classical experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (C-EAMG) mouse model has long been used by immunizing mice with acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo fish (T-AChR), combined with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). This mixture is administered via subcutaneous injections into the hind footpads and back, but CFA often causes strong inflammatory reactions, including lesions at the injection sites. Our objective was to develop a new EAMG model (N-EAMG) that is more compliant with animal welfare. C57Bl/6 mice were immunized twice weekly by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of T-AChR with a poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) adjuvant mix. Control mice were injected with either physiological saline or the adjuvant mix alone. Various doses and injection schedules were tested, and the new model was compared with C-EAMG. Clinical symptoms were scored, antibody subtypes against T-AChR and mouse AChR were measured, and NMJ morphology and functionality were evaluated. We demonstrate that the N-EAMG model is at least as effective as the C-EAMG model. Moreover, similar to the C-EAMG model, the N-EAMG model is characterized by the production of T-AChR and m-AChR antibodies. This model also exhibited alterations in transmission at the NMJ due to antibody attack, resulting in a decrease in AChR surface area and increased AChR fragmentation. Symptoms were similar in both models but appeared more rapidly in the N-EAMG model. In addition, investigating the sensitization mechanism, we showed that i.p. injections of T-AChR with the poly(I:C)/LPS adjuvant mix, led to the recruitment in monocytes and changes in the two peritoneal macrophage subpopulations that were able to phagocytose T-AChR. These observations suggest that macrophage subtypes, albeit with varying efficiency, present the T-AChR to immune cells, leading to a specific immune response and the development of anti-AChR antibodies. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that this novel EAMG model is as effective as the C-EAMG model and offers several advantages. In particular, this model is more suitable for animal welfare and can replace the classical model in preclinical and fundamental research.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

In vitro experiments were employed using human primary VICs with TSP-1 knockdown, cultured in osteogenic induction medium, and followed by analyses including western blot, alkaline phosphatase staining, alizarin red staining, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. In vivo experiments used two murine models of CAVD to determine the role of TSP-1 silencing on aortic valve calcification.

Healthy participants (n = 94, mean age 71.1\u00a0years SD 5.10, 56% female) were recruited to investigate the relationship between nutrient intake (protein, fibre, carbohydrate, fat), physical function (chair rise time, handgrip strength) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP); a marker of gut permeability. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, fat mass/fat free mass ratio, weight and gender, reported LBP changed by; -161.9\u00a0ng/mL (95% CI -323.0, -0.8) for every 1\u00a0g increase in daily fibre/1,000 kilocalories; 80.5\u00a0ng/mL (6.7, 154.2) for 1% increase in daily energy intake as fat; and -88.1\u00a0ng/mL (-146.7, -29.6) for 1% increase in daily energy as carbohydrates. When further adjusted for C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, LBP decreased by an additional 6.9\u00a0ng/mL for fibre, increased by an additional 4.0\u00a0ng/mL for fat and decreased by an additional 3.7\u00a0ng/mL for carbohydrate. These findings suggest that in healthy older adults' nutrient intake is associated with LBP, and CRP appears to slightly modify these associations. There were no associations between LBP and handgrip strength or chair rise time. Results suggest that fibre, fat, and carbohydrates are important for maintaining gut function, potentially mediated by inflammation in older adults, although further research is needed to explore the implications for physical function and CRP as a mediator.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

The two major paediatric cooperative groups provide different therapeutic protocols based on different staging and classification, initially developed to serve patients in North America and Europe, but also used in many other parts/regions of the world. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) has developed a structure whereby such complex information may be harmonised, and able to be applied to patients globally. An international expert panel consisting of paediatric pathologists and oncologists produced a set of items critical to cancer reporting and subjected these to review and discussion using the structured processes provided by the ICCR. A formal ICCR structure was assembled, and consensus surrounding elements and their application to different therapeutic protocols was developed. The data set underwent open international consultation. This resulted in the first international data set for Wilms tumour (WT) and other paediatric renal tumours, provided herein. The use of ICCR methods enables a full understanding of highly complex and often overlapping reporting elements by international experts, and the potential of developing a set of commonly applied data elements that are fully defined. This sets the groundwork for future consolidation of definitions and harmonisation of therapies for WT and other paediatric renal tumour patients.

OMVs were isolated and their characteristics were examined through transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. PD-L1 expression was quantified via Western blot, while CD8+ T cell proliferation was measured using flow cytometry. Cytokine production (interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)) was evaluated using ELISA.

In CRC cells, treatment with AKK-derived OMVs (AKK-OMVs) significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and markedly increased CD8+ T cell proliferation and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Additionally, AKK-OMVs-treated mice showed increased expression of immune activation markers within the tumor tissue, further indicating enhanced antitumor immunity. This study reveals that AKK-OMVs, particularly those containing Amuc_1434, can modulate PD-L1 expression and potentiate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in CRC.

This involved bacterial isolation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and analysis of potential factors that may have led to resistance, such as antibiotic prescribing and patient comorbidities. Descriptive statistics were therefore applied in SPSS for data analysis. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (70%) and exhibited significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 30% and to fluoroquinolones at 22%. Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains comprised 8% of   isolates.

Increased biocide usage in households, agriculture, livestock farming, industrial settings, and hospitals produces persistent chemical residues that pollute soil and aquatic environments. Such contaminants contribute to the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), facilitating their dissemination among humans, animals, and ecosystems. In this review, we conduct a critical assessment of four significant issues pertaining to this topic. Specifically, (i) the role of biocides in exerting selective pressure within the environmental resistome, thereby promoting the proliferation of resistant microbial populations and contributing to the global spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs); (ii) the role of biocides in triggering transient phenotypic adaptations in bacteria, including efflux pump overexpression, membrane alterations, and reduced porin expression, which often result in cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics; (iii) the capacity of biocides to disrupt bacteria and make the genetic content accessible, releasing DNA into the environment that remains intact under certain conditions, facilitating horizontal gene transfer and the spread of resistance determinants; (iv) the capacity of biocides to disrupt bacterial cells, releasing intact DNA into the environment and enhancing horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants; and (iv) the selective interactions between biocides and bacterial biofilms in the environment, strengthening biofilm cohesion, inducing resistance mechanisms, and creating reservoirs for resistant microorganisms and ARG dissemination.

Recent research has revealed that in impaired skin tissues, FGF21 and its receptors are upregulated and play a significant role in accelerating the wound healing process. However, the clinical application of FGF21 is severely limited by its short   half-life: this factor is often degraded by enzymes before it can exert its therapeutic effects. To address this limitation, the transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) has emerged as an innovative approach that enables sustained drug release, significantly prolonging the therapeutic duration. Leveraging genetic recombination technology, research teams have ingeniously fused FGF21 with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to construct recombinant FGF21 complexes. These novel conjugates can efficiently penetrate the epidermal barrier and achieve sustained and stable pharmacological activity through TDDS. This review systematically analyzes the potential signaling pathways by which FGF21 accelerates skin wound repair, summarizes the latest advancements in TDDS technology, explores the therapeutic potential of FGF21, and evaluates the efficacy of CPP fusion tags. The manuscript not only proposes an innovative paradigm for the application of FGF21 in skin injury treatment but also provides new insights into its use in transdermal delivery, marking a significant step toward overcoming existing clinical therapeutic challenges.

We sought to understand the utilization and procedural safety of cardiac catheterization in pediatric patients on ECMO. We also aimed to understand differences in the types of interventions and outcomes in patients with single ventricle (SV) physiology compared to those with biventricular physiology. Characteristics and outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization while on ECMO were collected from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry: IMPACT (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment) Registry from 2011-2022. There were 3473 cardiac catheterizations performed on 2980 pediatric patients during the study period. Patients with SV comprised 31.6% of the population. Survival to hospital discharge was 53.2% overall, 45.2% in patients with SV, and 56.8% in patients with 2 ventricles. Interventional procedures occurred in 52.5% of cases. Major adverse events occurred in 11.5%, with arrhythmia, bleeding events, and unplanned cardiac/other surgeries being the commonest. Regression analysis found SV was significantly associated with major adverse events, as were interventional procedures, female sex, non-Hispanic race, diabetes mellitus, procedure status classified as salvage vs elective, and systemic heparinization. This is the first large, multicenter review of safety and outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization while on ECMO. The study identifies common adverse events during the procedure as well as risk factors associated with the same. The presented data can serve for benchmarking, quality assessment as well as potential future research.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who presented to an urban academic medical center ED for any indication and had elevated blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mm Hg and \u2264180/110 mm Hg). Eligible participants who were discharged from the ED were enrolled between February 12, 2019, and March 31, 2023, and were randomized to receive either usual care or the intervention with follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. Usual care involved standard hypertension discharge instructions with a referral for outpatient follow-up.

This cohort study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, collected CVH data for participants from 4 US centers from 1985 to 2020. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations of (1) cumulative LE8 score by quartile, (2) cumulative LE8 score and score at age 45 years, and (3) cumulative LE8 score and LE8 score slope from age 18 to 45 years with incident CVD and mortality after age 45 years.

All patients underwent definitive treatment consisting of irrigation and debridement, followed by immediate intramedullary nailing during the same anesthetic. Patients with type IIIB fractures who did not receive soft tissue coverage within 7 days of presentation, as well as those with type IIIC fractures were excluded. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of deep infection necessitating a return to the operating room. Time to surgery was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Time intervals to surgical debridement were categorized as follows: less than 6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, 18 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether key factors, including age, diabetes, fracture type, smoking, ASA classification, and time to debridement at the previously categorized time points were predictive of infection.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and stroke. Rats in the stroke groups underwent photothrombosis-induced IS in the sensorimotor cortex area. They were divided into the following subgroups: treated with anti-CD20 after ischemia and killed after 5 and/or 10 days of IS. Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA levels of inflammation markers (VIM, ANXA3, SLC22 A4, and ADM), and also levels of transcription factors for Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets (Tbet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3, respectively), and also Foxp3 were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of ADM and SLC22 A4 increased following IS on the 5th and 10th days, while treatment with anti-CD20 reversed their levels. Anti-CD20 therapy attenuated inflammation through down-regulation of VIM and ANXA3 after 10 days. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the downregulation of Th1-Th17-driven inflammatory responses (Tbet and ROR\u03b3t) and the upregulation of Th2 activities (GATA- 3). In addition, anti-CD20 increased the expression of Foxp3. Anti-CD20 treatment can also reduce brain tissue damage after 10 days.

The study included 20,009 hospitalized HF and AKD patients who underwent dialysis during hospitalization, recovered from dialysis within 90 days after discharge, and were followed until November 30, 2022, using data from TriNetX. The study period began in July 2015, coinciding with the availability of ARNi in the market. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance ARNi and ACEi groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the risks of mortality, major adverse kidney events (MAKE), readmission and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The follow-up period was conducted with a maximum duration of 5 years. A total of 20,009 AKD patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.2] years) were enrolled, of whom 21.9% received ARNi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. After matching, 4391 patients (mean age, 58.6 years; male, 67.9%) were identified in both the ARNi and control groups. ARNi users exhibited a significantly lower risk of mortality (aHR, 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.80, p = 0.01), MAKE (aHR, 0.58, 95% CI 0.51-0.66, p < 0.01 ), and readmission (aHR, 0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.68, p <0.01) versus controls. However, no significant difference in the risk of MACE was observed between the two groups (aHR, 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.09, p = 0.78). Subgroup analysis revealed ARNi users, when concomitantly treated with mineralocorticoids, diuretics, or beta-blockers had significantly lower risks of mortality, readmission, and MAKE than the control group. In addition, ARNi significantly reduced mortality and MAKE in patients with GFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m , irrespective of proteinuria status. However, no significant benefit was observed in patients with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m . In HF patients with AKD, ARNi was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, MAKE, and readmission risks compared to ACEi, particularly with concurrent mineralocorticoids, diuretics, or beta-blockers. Future research is necessary to further investigate the impact of ARNi on outcomes in patients with HF and AKD.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Predictive models were constructed using machine learning algorithms, and tree-based feature selection was applied to evaluate the contributions of AKI and renal function indicators to mortality prediction. A total of 127 GPA patients were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression identified AKI (OR\u2009>\u20091, P\u2009<\u20090.05) as a significant predictor of 1-year mortality.

Furthermore, both patient populations show increased risk of many communicable infectious diseases and their adverse consequences, while vaccination can play a crucial role in their prevention, improving patient outcomes. Vaccination should represent a standard part of care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and both the diseases simultaneously, including people undergoing cancer treatment or in remission. Several international guidelines provide recommendations for vaccinating people with cancer or diabetes, but the two conditions have not been specifically evaluated together. Here we present a multidisciplinary consensus position paper on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. The position paper is the result of a collaborative effort between experts from the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD), Italian Society of Diabetology (SID), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and Italian Society of Pharmacology (SIF). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art knowledge on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. It discusses the importance of vaccination in preventing infections, focuses attention on the need to consider the unique challenges faced by patients with cancer and diabetes when it comes to vaccine administration, and highlights the need for coordinated care to optimize treatment outcomes.

However, the mechanism by which this effect is produced is not completely clear. In this study, we explored the involvement of TRPV1 and the MOR-NMDAR complex in the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice with neuropathic pain. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by administering streptozotocin-nicotinamide. Four weeks later, once neuropathic pain was established, the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 (56.2\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using the up-down method with the von Frey filaments, both in the absence and the presence of capsazepine (8\u00a0mg/kg, ip), naloxone (NLX, 1\u00a0mg/kg, ip), NMDA (0.4 nM/10 \u00b5L, it), or their co-administration (NLX-NMDA). Gabapentin was used as positive control. Pretreatment with NLX did not alter the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in the up-down method with the von Frey filaments in hyperglycemic mice, whereas NMDA significantly reduced it. The addition of NLX to NMDA (NLX-NMDA) did not modify the effect of NMDA alone on the antiallodynic activity of LMH-2. Additionally, capsazepine completely blocked the antinociceptive effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice. Molecular docking analysis suggested a potential interaction between LMH-2 and TRPV1. Moreover, a higher dose of LMH-2 did not cause mortality or damage in healthy mice. These results suggest the potential utility of LMH-2 in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and highlight a key role for TRPV1 in LMH-2's antiallodynic mechanism, along with a possible, albeit limited, interaction with the MOR/NMDA complex.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Resistance and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics are continually on the rise, and vaccines remain in development. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on prophage contribution to the epidemiology of GBS isolates from humans in South America. In the context of an Argentinian multicentric study, we had previously phenotypically characterized 365 human GBS isolates from invasive disease, urinary infections and maternal colonization. These isolates had been whole-genome sequenced, and their prophage presence was bioinformatically determined. In this study, we genomically characterized the isolates and analysed the prophage content in the context of the epidemiological data. The phylogenetic analysis of the 365 genomes with 103 GBS from public databases revealed that Argentinian GBS were related to isolates from around the world. The most prevalent lineages, independent of the isolated source, were CC23/Ia and CC12/Ib. Genes encoding virulence factors involved in immune response evasion, tissue damage and adherence to host tissues, and invasion were found in all of the genomes in accordance with previously described lineage distribution. According to the prevalent capsular types and the distribution of specific virulence factors in Argentinian GBS, over 95% coverage would be expected from the vaccines currently under development. Antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) to at least one antibiotic class were found in 90% of the genomes, including novel mutations in  2x, while more than 15% carried ARDs to three or more classes. GBS collected from urinary infections carried a significantly higher proportion of ARDs to multiple antibiotic classes than the rest of the isolates. A total of 454 prophages were found among the 468 genomes analysed, which were classified into 23 prophage types. Prophage presence exhibited variations based on GBS clonal complex and capsular type. A possible association between an increased GBS pathogenicity and the carriage of prophages with integrase type GBS 8 and/or the presence of genes that encode the Phox Homology domain has been observed. The highest prevalence of prophages per genome was found in lineages CC17/III and CC19/III, while the lowest amount was observed in CC12/Ib. Overall, the highest density of prophages, virulence factors and ARDs determinants was found in CC19 isolates, mostly of capsular type III, independent of the isolates' source.

This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations. Distinguishing direct effects of changes in consumption from one drug to another from common but unrelated responses to external events remains a challenge, as there are many factors that can influence consumption. The findings provide a better understanding of the interdependencies in the consumption of the most commonly prescribed antibacterial drugs, improving the understanding of potential influencing factors to support strategies for rational prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

Ninety-five patients with glaucoma underwent Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and driving simulations every 6 months. Rates of VF loss were estimated by changes in mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular VF over time. Driving performance was assessed using a simulator by maintaining lane position on a winding road while responding to peripheral visual stimuli to assess divided attention. Reaction time (RT) recorded the duration between the presentation of the stimuli and the participant's response. Linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes in SAP MS and mean RT. Multivariable linear regression models were used to predict driving performance, adjusting for age, cognitive impairment, and driving exposure. Progressive VF loss was associated with a longitudinal increase in mean RT to the divided attention task.

This study aimed to develop a mathematical model to represent the anatomical localization and functional organization of the insula, drawing on current neuroimaging findings and established anatomical data. A three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid model was constructed to mathematically represent the anatomical boundaries of the insula using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate data. This geometric model adapts the ellipsoid equation to reflect the spatial configuration of the insula and is primarily based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and anatomical literature. Relevant findings from prior imaging research, particularly those reporting microstructural variations across insular subdivisions, were reviewed and conceptually integrated to guide the model's structural assumptions and interpretation of potential applications. The ellipsoid-based 3D model accurately represented the anatomical dimensions and spatial localization of the right insula, centered at the MNI coordinates (40, 5, 5\u00a0mm), and matched well with the known volumetric data. Functional regions (face, hand, and foot) were successfully plotted within the model, and statistical analysis confirmed significant differences along the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively). Dynamic simulations revealed oscillatory patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity, consistent with established insular neurophysiology. Additionally, connectivity modeling demonstrated strong bidirectional interactions between the insula and key regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), reflecting its integrative role in brain networks.

When immature, they take up and process antigens efficiently. When mature, they express high levels of MHC class I and II molecules and costimulatory molecules on their surface and secrete both IL-12 and IL-15 that can activate and steer T cells. However, in patients with cancer or tumor-bearing animals, cancers secrete cytokines that suppress DC development or maturation. To circumvent this barrier to immunization against cancer, strategies have been developed to grow and mature DCs ex vivo from precursors, such as peripheral blood monocytes or bone marrow precursors, induce expression of tumor antigens ex vivo, and then administer the autologous DCs to the patient as a vaccine. The DCs may be coated with synthetic antigenic peptides or transduced with a virus expressing the tumor antigen (see Note 1). Both of these have been used in early clinical trials with promising immunogenicity. Such cancer vaccines may be especially critical for \"cold\" tumors that do not induce a sufficient immune response by themselves to be amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy or blockade of other negative regulators of immunity but with a cancer vaccine to induce the immune response, may become responsive to such immunotherapies. Conversely, cancer vaccines should become more effective if immunosuppressive mechanisms are blocked. Thus, the two approaches should synergize to optimize anticancer immune responses and reject the cancer like an allogeneic organ transplant.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"}

However, little is known about the variation in outcomes for patients with DFUs according to the health care facilities treating them. To examine facility-level variation in major leg amputation among veterans with incident DFUs using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cohort. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021, of all veterans with a new diagnosis of DFU at 140 VHA facilities across the US. Patients were followed up to 1 year from DFU diagnosis. Analyses were conducted between March 22, 2024, and January 13, 2025. A facility was assigned to each patient corresponding to the health care site where the initial DFU diagnosis was made. The primary outcome was major leg amputation during the follow-up period. A multivariable mixed-effects regression model with random facility intercepts was applied to assess variation in major leg amputation rates across facilities, adjusting for social drivers of health, comorbidities, and complicated DFU at initial diagnosis. The median odds ratio (MOR) was calculated to quantify facility-level variation in outcomes. A total of 86\u202f094 veterans (98.3% male; mean [SD] age, 73.0 [8.1] years; age range, 55-102 years) were included. Major leg amputation was performed for 3279 veterans (3.8%) within a year of DFU diagnosis. The MOR for facility-level variation in major leg amputation was 1.85, indicating that the odds of major leg amputation were 1.85 times higher between 2 randomly selected facilities for an average patient (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

A total of 393 patients (306 males) with a mean age of 38 years (range 15-87 years) were included. Of these, 24 patients (6%) had diabetes and 126 patients (32%) were smokers. There were 78 (20%) type I fractures, 170 (43%) type II fractures, and 144 (37%) type III fractures. Of the type III fractures, 99 (68%) were type IIIA while 45 (32%) were type IIIB. A total of 32 patients (8%) were treated within 6 hours, 111 patients (28%) between 6 and 12 hours, 131 patients (33%) between 12 and 18 hours, 69 patients (18%) between 18 and 24 hours, and 50 patients (13%) after 24 hours. A total of 46 infections (12.5%) were observed: 6 infections (13%) in type I fractures, 14 infections (20%) in type II fractures, 10 infections (22%) in type IIIA fractures, and 16 infections (35%) in type IIIB fractures. Time to surgery was not predictive of infection (p=0.31). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with a type IIIB fracture were 6.1 times more likely to develop an infection compared to other fracture types (OR = 6.147, 95% CI: 1.975- 19.129, p = 0.002). Smokers were 2.8 times more likely to develop an infection (OR = 2.779, 95% CI: 1.357-5.691, P = 0.005). Age, time to debridement at the specified time points, diabetes, and ASA classification did not significantly predict infection (p = 0.32, 0.31, 0.27, and 0.50, respectively). Smoking and type IIIB fractures were identified as significant predictors of infection following immediate medullary nailing of open tibial shaft fractures, whereas time to debridement, within the categorized time points, was not found to be a significant factor.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Furthermore, both patient populations show increased risk of many communicable infectious diseases and their adverse consequences, while vaccination can play a crucial role in their prevention, improving patient outcomes. Vaccination should represent a standard part of care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and both the diseases simultaneously, including people undergoing cancer treatment or in remission. Several international guidelines provide recommendations for vaccinating people with cancer or diabetes, but the two conditions have not been specifically evaluated together. Here we present a multidisciplinary consensus position paper on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. The position paper is the result of a collaborative effort between experts from the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD), Italian Society of Diabetology (SID), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and Italian Society of Pharmacology (SIF). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art knowledge on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. It discusses the importance of vaccination in preventing infections, focuses attention on the need to consider the unique challenges faced by patients with cancer and diabetes when it comes to vaccine administration, and highlights the need for coordinated care to optimize treatment outcomes.

When immature, they take up and process antigens efficiently. When mature, they express high levels of MHC class I and II molecules and costimulatory molecules on their surface and secrete both IL-12 and IL-15 that can activate and steer T cells. However, in patients with cancer or tumor-bearing animals, cancers secrete cytokines that suppress DC development or maturation. To circumvent this barrier to immunization against cancer, strategies have been developed to grow and mature DCs ex vivo from precursors, such as peripheral blood monocytes or bone marrow precursors, induce expression of tumor antigens ex vivo, and then administer the autologous DCs to the patient as a vaccine. The DCs may be coated with synthetic antigenic peptides or transduced with a virus expressing the tumor antigen (see Note 1). Both of these have been used in early clinical trials with promising immunogenicity. Such cancer vaccines may be especially critical for \"cold\" tumors that do not induce a sufficient immune response by themselves to be amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy or blockade of other negative regulators of immunity but with a cancer vaccine to induce the immune response, may become responsive to such immunotherapies. Conversely, cancer vaccines should become more effective if immunosuppressive mechanisms are blocked. Thus, the two approaches should synergize to optimize anticancer immune responses and reject the cancer like an allogeneic organ transplant.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"},

However, the mechanism by which this effect is produced is not completely clear. In this study, we explored the involvement of TRPV1 and the MOR-NMDAR complex in the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice with neuropathic pain. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by administering streptozotocin-nicotinamide. Four weeks later, once neuropathic pain was established, the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 (56.2\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using the up-down method with the von Frey filaments, both in the absence and the presence of capsazepine (8\u00a0mg/kg, ip), naloxone (NLX, 1\u00a0mg/kg, ip), NMDA (0.4 nM/10 \u00b5L, it), or their co-administration (NLX-NMDA). Gabapentin was used as positive control. Pretreatment with NLX did not alter the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in the up-down method with the von Frey filaments in hyperglycemic mice, whereas NMDA significantly reduced it. The addition of NLX to NMDA (NLX-NMDA) did not modify the effect of NMDA alone on the antiallodynic activity of LMH-2. Additionally, capsazepine completely blocked the antinociceptive effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice. Molecular docking analysis suggested a potential interaction between LMH-2 and TRPV1. Moreover, a higher dose of LMH-2 did not cause mortality or damage in healthy mice.

Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Resistance and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics are continually on the rise, and vaccines remain in development. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on prophage contribution to the epidemiology of GBS isolates from humans in South America. In the context of an Argentinian multicentric study, we had previously phenotypically characterized 365 human GBS isolates from invasive disease, urinary infections and maternal colonization. These isolates had been whole-genome sequenced, and their prophage presence was bioinformatically determined. In this study, we genomically characterized the isolates and analysed the prophage content in the context of the epidemiological data. The phylogenetic analysis of the 365 genomes with 103 GBS from public databases revealed that Argentinian GBS were related to isolates from around the world. The most prevalent lineages, independent of the isolated source, were CC23/Ia and CC12/Ib. Genes encoding virulence factors involved in immune response evasion, tissue damage and adherence to host tissues, and invasion were found in all of the genomes in accordance with previously described lineage distribution. According to the prevalent capsular types and the distribution of specific virulence factors in Argentinian GBS, over 95% coverage would be expected from the vaccines currently under development. Antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) to at least one antibiotic class were found in 90% of the genomes, including novel mutations in  2x, while more than 15% carried ARDs to three or more classes. GBS collected from urinary infections carried a significantly higher proportion of ARDs to multiple antibiotic classes than the rest of the isolates. A total of 454 prophages were found among the 468 genomes analysed, which were classified into 23 prophage types. Prophage presence exhibited variations based on GBS clonal complex and capsular type. A possible association between an increased GBS pathogenicity and the carriage of prophages with integrase type GBS 8 and/or the presence of genes that encode the Phox Homology domain has been observed. The highest prevalence of prophages per genome was found in lineages CC17/III and CC19/III, while the lowest amount was observed in CC12/Ib. Overall, the highest density of prophages, virulence factors and ARDs determinants was found in CC19 isolates, mostly of capsular type III, independent of the isolates' source.

This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations.

Fimbriae are important virulence factors involved in biofilm formation and adhesion to host cells. Their exposed location, conservation among clinical isolates and adjuvant properties make them interesting candidates for inclusion in protein-based vaccines. Therefore, the present work investigated the immunological potential of type 1 and 3 fimbriae subunits in a murine model of   lung infection. MrkA and FimA were produced as recombinant proteins in  , purified and used to immunize mice subcutaneously. The immune responses were characterized and protection against pneumonia was evaluated after intranasal challenge. Subcutaneous immunization with recombinant FimA and MrkA induced high IgG1 production; the antibodies efficiently recognized the native proteins at the bacterial surface, promoted C3 deposition and reduced biofilm formation by   in vitro. Mice vaccinated with the co-administered proteins reduced the bacterial loads in the lungs after intranasal challenge, less inflammation and reduced tissue damage.

Ninety-five patients with glaucoma underwent Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and driving simulations every 6 months. Rates of VF loss were estimated by changes in mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular VF over time. Driving performance was assessed using a simulator by maintaining lane position on a winding road while responding to peripheral visual stimuli to assess divided attention. Reaction time (RT) recorded the duration between the presentation of the stimuli and the participant's response. Linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes in SAP MS and mean RT. Multivariable linear regression models were used to predict driving performance, adjusting for age, cognitive impairment, and driving exposure. Progressive VF loss was associated with a longitudinal increase in mean RT to the divided attention task. In the multivariable model, each 1 decibel (dB)/year faster loss of integrated binocular MS was associated with a 0.024 logarithms (ln) s/year increase in mean RT (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.007 to 0.042, P = 0.008).

Although several studies have described its anatomical and functional characteristics, mathematical models that quantitatively represent the insula's complex structure and connectivity are lacking. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model to represent the anatomical localization and functional organization of the insula, drawing on current neuroimaging findings and established anatomical data. A three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid model was constructed to mathematically represent the anatomical boundaries of the insula using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate data. This geometric model adapts the ellipsoid equation to reflect the spatial configuration of the insula and is primarily based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and anatomical literature. Relevant findings from prior imaging research, particularly those reporting microstructural variations across insular subdivisions, were reviewed and conceptually integrated to guide the model's structural assumptions and interpretation of potential applications. The ellipsoid-based 3D model accurately represented the anatomical dimensions and spatial localization of the right insula, centered at the MNI coordinates (40, 5, 5\u00a0mm), and matched well with the known volumetric data. Functional regions (face, hand, and foot) were successfully plotted within the model, and statistical analysis confirmed significant differences along the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively).

Emergency department (ED) visits serve as critical access points within health care and present a unique opportunity for hypertension screening and intervention. To evaluate the effectiveness of an Education and mHealth Empowerment (E2) intervention compared with usual care in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) among patients with elevated BP discharged from the ED. This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who presented to an urban academic medical center ED for any indication and had elevated blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mm Hg and \u2264180/110 mm Hg). Eligible participants who were discharged from the ED were enrolled between February 12, 2019, and March 31, 2023, and were randomized to receive either usual care or the intervention with follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. Usual care involved standard hypertension discharge instructions with a referral for outpatient follow-up. The E2 intervention involved a 3-prong approach, which included a brief Post-Acute Care Hypertension consultation (PACHT-c) with a clinical pharmacist or an advanced practice nurse, a smartphone-enabled BP monitoring kit (Withings device and mobile app) for daily self-monitoring along with behavior change text messages, and primary care referral. The primary outcome was the mean change in SBP (mm Hg) from baseline to 6 months. Of the 574 participants enrolled, mean (SD) age was 51.1 (12.5) years, and 323 (56%) were female; 413 were Black (72%), 115 were Hispanic or Latino (20%), 27 were White (5%), and 19 were other race and ethnicity (3%), which included Asian, American Indian, and other racial or ethnic groups. Of the 413 patients with BP data at 6 months, the E2 intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009210) showed a greater mean reduction in SBP (mean difference, 4.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8-9.0 mm Hg; P\u2009=\u2009.02) compared with the usual-care group (n\u2009=\u2009203).

To determine whether cumulative CVH, as measured by the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 (LE8) from age 18 to 45 years, is associated with incident CVD and mortality in midlife. This cohort study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, collected CVH data for participants from 4 US centers from 1985 to 2020. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations of (1) cumulative LE8 score by quartile, (2) cumulative LE8 score and score at age 45 years, and (3) cumulative LE8 score and LE8 score slope from age 18 to 45 years with incident CVD and mortality after age 45 years.

Participants underwent same-day quantitative contrast sensitivity function (qCSF) and 6 \u00d7 6 mm OCT angiography (OCTA) centered on the optic disc.

Mixed-effects multivariable regression models, controlling for age, hypertension, and lens status, evaluated associations between RPC OCTA metrics, DR severity, VA, and qCSF. Significant RPC microvascular changes were observed across DR stages. Capillary perfusion density decreased with DR severity and even before retinopathy onset in DMnoDR versus controls (\u03b2avg = -0.42, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).

Anti-CD20 treatments have a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we investigated the effect of anti-CD20 on IS-induced inflammation and histopathologic changes in the rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and stroke. Rats in the stroke groups underwent photothrombosis-induced IS in the sensorimotor cortex area. They were divided into the following subgroups: treated with anti-CD20 after ischemia and killed after 5 and/or 10 days of IS. Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA levels of inflammation markers (VIM, ANXA3, SLC22 A4, and ADM), and also levels of transcription factors for Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets (Tbet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3, respectively), and also Foxp3 were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of ADM and SLC22 A4 increased following IS on the 5th and 10th days, while treatment with anti-CD20 reversed their levels. Anti-CD20 therapy attenuated inflammation through down-regulation of VIM and ANXA3 after 10 days. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the downregulation of Th1-Th17-driven inflammatory responses (Tbet and ROR\u03b3t) and the upregulation of Th2 activities (GATA- 3). In addition, anti-CD20 increased the expression of Foxp3. Anti-CD20 treatment can also reduce brain tissue damage after 10 days.

This study aimed to explore the role and underlying mechanisms of the 5-methylcytosine (m C) RNA methyltransferase NOL1/NOP2/SUN domain (NSUN)2 in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). To assess cell viability and death, we employed Cell Counting Kit-8 and propidium iodide staining. Ferroptosis-related markers were evaluated using commercial kits and Western blot analysis. The m C levels of ferroptosis-associated mRNAs were quantified by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR. The specific m C sites on the transferrin receptor (TFRC) mRNA were identified through a dual-luciferase reporter assay, while the interaction between NSUN2 and TFRC was investigated using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). The role of SHK   was explored using a xenografted tumor model. Our findings revealed that SHK significantly reduced cell viability and induced cell death and ferroptosis in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Notably, SHK treatment led to an upregulation of NSUN2 expression. Inhibition of NSUN2 reversed the effects of SHK, restoring cell viability and reducing cell death and ferroptosis. Mechanistically, NSUN2 enhanced TFRC expression via m C-dependent methylation. Overexpression of NSUN2 similarly decreased cell viability and increased cell death and ferroptosis, effects that were mitigated upon silencing of TFRC.  , SHK treatment effectively suppressed tumor growth in xenografted mice. In summary, our study demonstrated that SHK promoted cell death and ferroptosis in AML by modulating NSUN2-mediated m C methylation of TFRC.

RGC degeneration is the root cause of a variety of blinding diseases linked to optic nerve damage, including glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The underlying cellular mechanisms of RGC degeneration are largely unclear; yet, they have been connected to excessive production of the signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which subsequently produces the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This, in turn, activates protein kinase G (PKG), which can phosphorylate downstream protein targets. To study the role of NO/cGMP/PKG signalling in RGC degeneration, we used organotypic retinal explant cultures in which the optic nerve had been severed. We assessed the activity of NOS, RGC death and survival at different times after optic nerve transection. While NOS activity was high right after optic nerve transection, significant RGC loss occurred with a 24-48-h delay. We then treated retinal explants with inhibitors selectively targeting either NOS, sGC, PKG, or Kv1.3 and Kv1.6 voltage-gated potassium channels. While all four treatments reduced RGC death, the PKG inhibitor CN238 and the Kv-channel blocker Margatoxin (MrgX) showed the most pronounced rescue effects. Our results confirm an involvement of NO/cGMP/PKG signalling in RGC degeneration, highlight the potential of PKG and Kv1-channel targeting drugs for treatment development, and further suggest organotypic retinal explant cultures as a useful model for investigations into optic nerve damage.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

A three-year-old boy with global developmental delay, was referred for evaluation of rapid weight gain over the preceding three months, accompanied by increased body hair, a moon-shaped face, and sleep disturbances. Biochemical testing revealed undetectable ACTH levels and elevated cortisol levels, leading to the diagnosis of ACTH-independent CS. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated adrenal asymmetry, with a larger left adrenal gland, and further investigation using PET scan excluded the presence of adrenal adenomas/carcinomas. The patient was initially treated with metyrapone, which effectively reduced cortisol levels. However, after two months, a left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathological examination confirmed micronodular non-pigmented adrenal hyperplasia. One year later, cortisol levels increased again with undetectable ACTH, prompting the re-initiation of metyrapone. Due to intolerance to this medication, osilodrostat, an off-label treatment, was introduced. At the time of follow-up, 15\u00a0months after initiation of osilodrostat, both serum and urinary cortisol levels remained within normal ranges, ACTH levels remained undetectable, and the clinical symptoms of CS were well controlled. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with rare pediatric cases of ACTH-independent CS. The treatment course, which included metyrapone, adrenalectomy, and off-label use of osilodrostat, resulted in significant improvement in cortisol control and clinical symptoms. Ongoing genetic analysis is being conducted to explore potential underlying genetic factors contributing to the patient's non-pigmented micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and developmental delay.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

MO can cause irreversible tissue damage and permanent visual impairment. Dexamethasone implant is approved for intravitreal injection (IV) in the treatment of MO. Despite its proven efficacy, IV poses risks of complications. Recently, suprachoroidal injection has emerged as a novel strategy for targeted drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye, reducing the risk of complications.Case presentationA 70-year-old woman with no history of diabetes underwent left eye cataract surgery complicated by a capsular rupture and vitreous prolapse, which resulted in the patient becoming aphakic. Later, ophthalmic examination revealed a cystoid MO secondary to a posterior postoperative NIU. Since IV injection of triamcinolone had minimal visual benefit and due to the contraindication of IV cortisone implants, a dexamethasone implant was injected via the suprachoroidal injection, with additional intravitreal triamcinolone. Functional and anatomical recovery was observed after the procedure, with improved visual acuity and no ocular hypertension.ConclusionOur study describes a successful case of dexamethasone implant administered via suprachoroidal space, with no complications and a possible increased effectiveness when compared with intravitreal triamcinolone.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

One such therapy is self-administered, intramuscular injections of paraffin oil for the purpose of increasing presumed muscular size. Paraffin oil injections are becoming frequent among younger male individuals, who inject up to several liters in (primarily) the upper extremities. However, paraffin oil leads to the formation of granulomas, which are rich in macrophages with an upregulated extrarenal 1-hydroxylation. These macrophages will rapidly and unimpededly convert inactive vitamin D (25OHD ) to active vitamin D (1,25OH D ), thereby causing significant hypercalcemia and derivative disease. In 2007, a Scandinavian male individual in his 20s had self-injected 1200\u00a0ml of paraffin oil into both biceps. Within 5\u00a0years, the oil had migrated and was then widely dispersed in his biceps and surrounding tissues, causing swelling and pain. By 2015, granulomas had formed at injection sites, and he was admitted to a hospital with severe hypercalcemia, which was managed with fluid therapy and slowly resolved. From 2015 to 2020, his calcium levels were intermittently elevated, and he experienced two episodes of nephrolithiasis requiring surgical intervention.

We aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the systematic review (SRs) of berberine for the treatment of diverse conditions. A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed was performed from the database inception to April 11, 2024. SRs on berberine were included and evaluated. The methodological quality and the reporting quality of each SR were assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool and PRISMA checklist, respectively. The quality of evidence was appraised based on the GRADE. Fifty-four SRs were included and analyzed. Overall, associations were found between berberine and 70 health outcomes concerned with 9 diseases. Berberine has improved most outcomes of these diseases: 78% (25/32) cardiovascular disease outcomes, 92.59% (25/27) type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes, 94.74% (18/19) gastrointestinal disorders outcomes, 72.22% (13/18) polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) outcomes, 86.67% (13/15) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) outcomes, 92.31% (12/13) schizophrenia outcomes, 90.91% (10/11) metabolic syndrome outcomes, 57.14% (4/7) obesity outcomes, and 100.00% (6/6) dyslipidemia outcomes. There was a high overlap of primary studies (CCA\u2009>\u200915%) in the SRs of PCOS, NAFLD, obesity, and schizophrenia.

This study was part of the Strong Mama research project, which was carried out in Oslo, Norway, between October 2022 and February 2024. Sixty athletes (10 elite and 50 recreational) participated in the study. They completed an online survey during late pregnancy and participated in a structured telephone interview six weeks postpartum. The survey and interview collected data on exercise habits, pregnancy experiences, and maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The athletes maintained high exercise levels during pregnancy, with elite athletes exercising an average of 11.6\u00a0h per week (SD 3.2) and recreational athletes exercising 7.0\u00a0h per week (SD 2.4). Most athletes resumed exercising within six weeks postpartum. Almost all pregnancies were planned, including six which involved fertility treatment. Most women (76.7%) had spontaneous onset of labor and vaginal deliveries to term (between 36 and 42 weeks). The mean birthweight was 3487 (SD 519.4, range 2600-4775) grams. Two of the elite athletes were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus and two with hypertension during pregnancy. None of the 50 recreational athletes reported any pregnancy complications.

However, less is known about the association between psychiatric symptoms and PA behaviour in trauma-exposed adults. Most prior investigations have focused on independent associations between overall depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to PA and have neglected specific symptom domains (e.g. anhedonia). Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses on a parent dataset to examine whether PTSD symptom severity moderates the association between anhedonia and PA volume.  Trauma-exposed adults ( \u2009=\u2009107, 61% women, M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age\u2009=\u200928\u2009\u00b1\u20099 y 54% White) completed questionnaires assessing demographic information, anhedonia, PTSD symptom severity (overall and symptom clusters), and PA volume (total MET-min/week). Main effects and interactions between anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity in relation to PA volume were examined with robust linear regression models.  We observed a significant anhedonia\u2009\u00d7\u2009PTSD symptom severity interaction. An inverse association between anhedonia and PA volume was observed among adults with lower-to-moderate PTSD symptom severity, and a positive association between anhedonia and PA volume was observed among adults with higher PTSD symptom severity. Significant anhedonia\u2009\u00d7\u2009PTSD symptom severity interactions for avoidance (Cluster C) and negative alterations in arousal/reactivity (Cluster E) symptoms were also observed, with associations in the same direction as the overall PTSD symptom severity model.  These preliminary findings suggest that co-occurring anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity profiles interact to influence PA volume in trauma-exposed adults. Future research is needed to understand why trauma-exposed adults with greater co-occurring anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity profiles reported engaging in higher levels of PA compared to those with lower symptom severity profiles. Such knowledge could help healthcare practitioners tailor treatment plans to incorporate or adjust PA prescriptions. This study contributes to an emerging area of research aimed at understanding the relationship between comorbid psychiatric symptoms and physical activity (PA) behaviours in trauma-exposed adults.Greater anhedonia was associated with lower PA among adults with lower-to-moderate PTSD symptom severity. Greater anhedonia was associated with higher PA among adults with higher PTSD symptom severity.Trauma-exposed adults with greater anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity may engage in high levels of PA as a coping or emotional regulation strategy (e.g. to combat high symptom burden, avoid hyperarousal symptoms, or compensate for loss of interest in some other previously enjoyable activity).", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

Timely diagnosis remains challenging due to the slow progression of symptoms and limited accessibility to advanced diagnostic tools, yet it remains one of the few tools available to prevent and alter the clinical course of the disease. The aim of this study is to build a cost-of-illness model to estimate the number of AD patients managed by the National Health Service, analyzing their use of hospital care, and estimating the social costs through real-world data. The analysis encompassed a multifaceted approach, combining real-world data analysis from different sources for the period 2014-2019. Health direct costs related to AD in Italy were estimated thanks to the Italian database of all hospital discharges and a Local Health Unit database (400,000 residents) collecting all information on resource consumption related to AD. The National Social Security System database was used to estimate social security costs (disability compensations) related to Attendance Allowance (AA) recognitions. In Italy a prevalence of 413,715 AD patients was estimated, with annual health direct costs per patient equal to \u20ac3,779. Annual social security costs related to AA recognitions amounted to 240\u00a0million euros. Overall, the analysis estimated an annual total cost exceeding 1.8\u00a0billion euros. This study provides a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted burden of AD in Italy, shedding light on its economic dimensions. The results underscore the urgency of prioritizing AD on political agendas, especially in the face of the projected global surge in AD cases. The study advocates for proactive policy interventions and informed healthcare decision-making to address the complex challenges posed by AD.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

Nowadays, nano-formulations, particularly carbon dots, have emerged as promising candidates for targeting and treating brain diseases. In this study, we report the synthesis of a novel carbon dots, PTX-CDs, using a one-step hydrothermal method with paclitaxel (PTX) as the precursor. PTX-CDs shows increased water solubility by about 1000 times in comparison with PTX. Moreover, PTX-CDs effectively penetrates the BBB and exerts significant anticancer effects. In detail, PTX-CDs accumulates in mitochondria of tumor cells without adding extra targeted molecules, resulting in the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Transcriptome profiling revealed that PTX-CDs disturbs the cell-cycle by inducing arrest at the G2/M phase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. PTX-CDs further decreased cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in glioblastoma cells. PTX-CDs significantly inhibited the growth of intracranial tumors in orthotopic glioblastoma mice model and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

Despite this burden, efforts to forecast WNV disease to inform public health measures to reduce disease incidence have had limited success. Here, we analyze forecasts submitted to the 2022 WNV Forecasting Challenge, a follow-up to the 2020 WNV Forecasting Challenge. Forecasting teams submitted probabilistic forecasts of annual West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (WNND) cases for each county in the continental USA for the 2022 WNV season. We assessed the skill of team-specific forecasts, baseline forecasts, and an ensemble created from team-specific forecasts. We then characterized the impact of model characteristics and county-specific contextual factors (e.g., population) on forecast skill. Ensemble forecasts for 2022 anticipated a season at or below median long-term WNND incidence for nearly all (>\u200999%) counties. More counties reported higher case numbers than anticipated by the ensemble forecast median, but national caseload (826) was well below the 10-year median (1386). Forecast skill was highest for the ensemble forecast, though the historical negative binomial baseline model and several team-submitted forecasts had similar forecast skill. Forecasts utilizing regression-based frameworks tended to have more skill than those that did not and models using climate, mosquito surveillance, demographic, or avian data had less skill than those that did not, potentially due to overfitting. County-contextual analysis showed strong relationships with the number of years that WNND had been reported and permutation entropy (historical variability). Evaluations based on weighted interval score and logarithmic scoring metrics produced similar results. The relative success of the ensemble forecast, the best forecast for 2022, suggests potential gains in community ability to forecast WNV, an improvement from the 2020 Challenge. Similar to the previous challenge, however, our results indicate that skill was still limited with general underprediction despite a relative low incidence year. Potential opportunities for improvement include refining mechanistic approaches, integrating additional data sources, and considering different approaches for areas with and without previous cases.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising tool for UL rehabilitation, offering immersive and engaging environments for motor recovery. However, the effectiveness of VR, its integration with conventional therapy, and their efficacy across different stroke recovery stages remain unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-based UL interventions in improving ADL and QoL among stroke survivors. This study adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023426256). A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Inclusion criteria focused on studies using immersive VR (IVR) and non-immersive VR (NIVR) interventions to assess ADL and QoL in stroke survivors. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers using the PEDro scale to assess quality. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the efficacy. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare IVR and NIVR, VR combined with conventional therapy versus standalone VR, and potential differences between stroke recovery stages. Thirty RCTs, representing 1,661 participants, were included. Overall, VR interventions significantly improved ADL (SMD\u2009=\u20090.27, 95% CI [0.11; 0.43], p\u2009<\u20090.001) and QoL (SMD\u2009=\u20090.94 [0.09; 1.79], p\u2009=\u20090.035) compared to conventional therapy.

Most drug resistance arises from the accumulation of genetic mutations in a minority of resistant cells. The mechanisms underlying the emergence and progression of cancer resistance from these minority-resistant cells (MRCs) remain poorly understood. This study employs force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) alongside various biological investigations to reveal the mechanical pathways for MRCs fostering drug resistance and tumor progression. The findings show that minority Paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells have enhanced mechanical properties. These cells can transmit high-intensity forces to surrounding sensitive cells (SCs) through the force transducer, Merlin. This force transmission facilitates the assimilation of surrounding SCs, subsequently strengthening the contraction and adhesion of tumor cells. This process is termed \"mechano-assimilation,\" which accelerates the development of drug resistance and tumor progression. Interestingly, disturbances and reductions of mechano-assimilation within tumors can restore sensitivity to Paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting the contribution of MRCs to the development of drug resistance and malignancy, mediated through mechanical interactions. It also establishes a foundation for future research focused on integrating mechanical factors into innovative cancer therapies.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"},

Sustained release of glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) within these conjugates continuously enhances T-cell endurance and potency by promoting memory differentiation and elevating crucial adhesion and motility genes. Concurrently, PD-L1 blocking peptides liberate T cells from immunosuppression, assisting T cells with precision toward tumor sites. This dual-targeting strategy-T cells directed at tumor antigens and peptides at PD-L1- enriches the tumor microenvironment with potent therapeutics, amplifying T cell-driven tumor destruction.

The protocells are assembled via electrostatically-driven self-assembly of \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD)-modified amino-dextran on a sacrificial template encapsulating glucose oxidase (GOx). To enable specific cancer cell targeting and catalytic activity, cell-targeting ligands (arginylglycylaspartic acid, cRGD) and catalase-like platinum-gold nanoparticles (Pt-AuNPs) are introduced through host-guest interactions, forming a fully functional, cell-targeting, bio-catalytic killer protocell.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of lung tissue from post-LTx patients was performed, and lung IRI was evaluated in C57BL/6 (WT), formyl peptide receptor 2 knockout (Fpr2 ) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 knockout (Nrf2 ) mice using a hilar-ligation model with or without LxA  administration. Furthermore, the protective efficacy of LxA  was evaluated employing a murine orthotopic LTx model and in\u00a0vitro studies using alveolar type II epithelial (ATII) cells. The results show differential expression of ferroptosis-related genes in post-LTx patient samples compared to healthy controls. A significant increase in the levels of oxidized lipids and a reduction in the levels of intact lipids were observed in mice subjected to IRI compared to shams. Importantly, LxA  treatment attenuated pulmonary dysfunction, ferroptosis, and inflammation in WT mice subjected to lung IRI, but not in Fpr2  or Nrf2  mice after IRI. In the murine LTx model, LxA  treatment increased PaO  levels and attenuated lung IRI. Mechanistically, LxA -mediated protection involves an increase in NRF2 activation and glutathione concentration as well as a decrease in MDA levels in ATII cells. In summary, our results collectively show that LxA /FPR2 signaling on ATII cells mitigates ferroptosis via NRF2 activation and protects against lung IRI.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Unfortunately, suitable animal models to study cardiac dysfunction caused by fatigue are lacking, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to establish a pathological fatigue model induced by 5-week combined stress and explore the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction triggered by fatigue. Five-week combined stress induced fatigue-like phenotypes, which included reluctance to move, reduced exercise endurance, and muscle strength. Moreover, the 5-week combined stress resulted in a significant reduction in both EF and FS, along with a marked upregulation of several myocardial injury biomarkers, thereby confirming the presence of abnormal cardiac function. Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that 80% of the differential metabolites were downregulated, suggesting a hypometabolic profile in the heart. Interestingly, among the downregulated fatty acid metabolites, we identified two bacterial metabolites, namely acetate and butyrate. More importantly, we observed an inverse correlation between the levels of acetate and butyrate and the concentrations of certain cardiac injury markers. We then observed disturbances in gut bacteria, and group differences at the genus level revealed that all six differential bacteria, which ranked in the top 10 in terms of relative abundance, may directly or indirectly influence the production of acetic acid and butyric acid. Among them, the abundance of Akkermansia bacteria was positively correlated with reduced acetic acid levels. In summary, the present study provides a novel animal model of pathological fatigue-induced cardiac dysfunction and suggests that hypometabolic features and gut microbiota dysbiosis may be an important mechanism.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Victims surviving an attack often suffer from the consequences of severe wound infections caused by the animal's sharp canine teeth. Isolation of normal flora bacteria from the oral cavity of common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious) followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing to aid in the identification of a targeted antibiotic treatment regimen for hippopotamus attack victims. Oral swabs were collected from 34 free-ranging hippopotami in three reserves within the Greater Kruger National Park Complex in South Africa and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was conducted using the disc diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer method) and a panel of 16 antibiotic drugs representing 10 antibiotic categories. Culturing of 50 oral swab samples from 34 hippopotami yielded 188 aerobic isolates belonging to 30 bacterial genera and 41 bacterial species (Gram-negative: 70.7%; Gram-positive: 29.3%) and 16 obligate anaerobic isolates from two genera. Three bacterial species, namely Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria and Shewanella putrefaciens accounted for 52% of the aerobic isolates. The anaerobic isolates were identified as Prevotella melaninogenica and Clostridium spp. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 112 aerobic isolates (Gram-negative: 93 (83%); Gram-positive: 19 (17%)) representing all isolated bacterial species. High levels of antibiotic resistance were observed among the Gram-negative species especially to most beta-lactam antibiotics (50.5% to 80.7%). Multidrug resistance was detected in 22.6% of Gram-negative isolates and in 24.1% of all isolates. This study provides the first investigation of the oral flora bacteria of the common hippopotamus. Among the 32 mostly aerobic bacterial genera the most abundant bacterial species were A. hydrophila, A. sobria and S. putrefaciens. They are typical inhabitants of the aquatic habitat of the hippopotamus and of zoonotic importance as opportunistic human pathogens. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles demonstrated that quinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines were highly efficacious against these bacterial species which otherwise showed moderate to high levels of resistance to the traditional bite wound treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 1st and 2nd generation cephalosporins.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

The viability tests were employed to assess the resistance-modifying properties of the extracts both in antibiotic-resistant bacterial cells and cancer cell-lines. To elucidate the potential mechanisms of the antibiotic modulatory activity of test extracts, the changes in H -fluxes across the cell membrane and their impact on the H -translocating F0F1-ATPase activity in antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli explored. Qualitative metabolomic characterization of the extracts was performed using LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, and quantitative analysis was carried out with UHPLC-PDA. Experiments on doxorubicin-resistant and susceptible HT-29 cells revealed that all three extracts reversed antibiotic resistance in HT-29R cells, making them susceptible to doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, blackcurrant, and fig significantly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and kanamycin against resistant E. coli strains. Our results indicated that all plant extracts enhanced H -fluxes in the investigated bacterial strain and promoted ATPase activity, suggesting a potential role in altering bacterial membrane integrity. LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis identified more than 100 major peaks, with flavonoids and phenolics being the dominant constituents. The study underscores the potential of the selected plant extracts in developing of new agents to overcome antibiotic resistance and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

Recent advancements in real-time Nanopore sequencing and basecalling algorithms have enabled the direct detection of modified bases from raw signal data, eliminating the need for bisulfite treatment of DNA. However, decoding methylation signals remains challenging due to rapid technological and methodological progress. In this study, we focus on public health-relevant bacterial strains to analyze their methylation profiles and identify methylation motifs. Our dataset includes samples from Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, sequenced on the Nanopore GridION platform using the latest flow cell chemistry (R10.4.1) and modification basecalling models (Dorado basecalling SUP model v5). We investigated distinct methylation patterns within and between species, focusing on heavily modified genes or genomic regions. Our results reveal distinct species-specific methylation profiles, with each strain exhibiting unique modification patterns. We developed a modular pipeline using Nextflow and the Nanopore Modkit tool to streamline the detection of methylated motifs. We compared the results with outputs from MicrobeMod, a recent toolkit for exploring prokaryotic methylation and base modifications in nanopore sequencing. Our pipeline is publicly available for further use (github.com/rki-mf1/ont-methylation). We identified known methylation motifs already described in the literature and novel de novo motifs, providing deeper insights into the diversity of bacterial DNA modifications. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions that are extensively methylated, which could have implications for bacterial behavior and pathogenicity. We also assess improvements in basecalling accuracy, specifically how methylated bases can influence neighboring basecalls. Recent advances in basecalling models, particularly v5 models as part of Dorado, have reduced these issues, improving the reliability of methylation detection in bacterial genomes. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of current nanopore sequencing tools for detecting DNA modifications in prokaryotes.

CRPA isolates were isolated from different clinical samples, identified, and subjected to antibiotic profiling using Vitek-2 method. The detection of biofilm was performed using Congo red agar (CRA), Microdilution broth assay (MBA), and qRT-PCR detection of Bap and ompA genes. Biosynthesis of Se-NPs with a cell-free filter (CFF) of Streptomyces sp. was done and characterized with various techniques, including UV-Vis, XRD, TEM, FTIR, and Zeta potential measurement. The antibacterial efficacy and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using disc diffusion and microdilution techniques. The checkerboard assay was used to formulate various combinations of imipenem and Se-NPs, alongside time-kill assays to assess their antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects and hemolytic activity of Se-NPs, imipenem and their combination were assessed. The identification process and antibiotic susceptibility testing confirmed that the bacterial isolates were found to be CRPA. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the CRPA produced biofilm, and qRT-PCR demonstrated that all CRPA strains under study have the Bap and ompA genes. The CFF of Streptomyces sp. was able to biosynthesize Se-NPs which presented UV-Visible spectrometric profile with sharp peak at 290\u00a0nm. Se-NPs appeared to be a spherical shape, with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 100\u00a0nm under TEM and have zeta potential value of -40 mV.

The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values ranged from 0.37 to 0.50 against tested CRPA strain with a significant reduction in the concentrations of Se-NPs and imipenem. QRT-PCR showed that Se-NPs alone or combination of Se-NPs and imipenem led to a reduction of Bap and ompA gene expression compared to control (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001). The study showed a significant difference in cell viability was observed across normal or cancer cell lines at high concentrations.

Clinically, these bacteria have also acquired resistance to polymyxin, the last resort of defense. Novel antibiotics with a single mode of action are susceptible to rapid resistance development, and sometimes asynchronous pharmacokinetics also hinders the effectiveness of combined administration strategies in vivo. Here, we developed a class of novel bifunctional antibacterial peptides by covalently conjugating a series of modified PbgA-derived peptides with colistin analog (PE-2C-C8-DH) via a small-molecule linker (KCM02). These bifunctional peptides show remarkable synergistic antibacterial efficacy, where \"1\u2009+\u20091\u2009>\u20092\", against various priority multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, involving polymyxin-resistant strains. By optimizing the structure-activity relationship, two compounds (BP-28 and BP-37) with distinct activity preferences were obtained, which possess rapid bactericidal efficacy and a significantly lower risk of resistance compared to single-mode-of-action antibacterial agents, without hemolytic toxicity and cytotoxicity. Identification of antibacterial targets revealed that they can damage Gram-negative bacterial membrane by targeting LPS and BamA. Our study offers a referable approach for the development of novel antimicrobial agents.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

Yet, animal models and in vitro experiments poorly replicate real-world conditions . To explain how resistance evolves in vivo, we exposed 60 human participants to ciprofloxacin and used longitudinal stool samples and a new computational method to assemble the genomes of 5,665 populations of commensal bacterial species within participants. Analysis of 2.3 million polymorphic sequence variants revealed 513 populations that underwent selective sweeps. We found convergent evolution focused on DNA gyrase and evidence of dispersed selective pressure at other genomic loci. Roughly 10% of susceptible bacterial populations evolved towards resistance through sweeps that involved substitutions at a specific amino acid in gyrase. The evolution of gyrase was associated with large populations that decreased in relative abundance during exposure. Sweeps persisted for more than 10\u2009weeks in most cases and were not projected to revert within a year. Targeted amplification showed that gyrase mutations arose de novo within the participants and exhibited no measurable fitness cost. These findings revealed that brief ciprofloxacin exposure drives the evolution of resistance in gut commensals, with mutations persisting long after exposure. This study underscores the capacity of the human gut to promote the evolution of resistance and identifies key genomic and ecological factors that shape bacterial adaptation in vivo.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"}

  "abstract": "Chemotherapy remains a prevalent strategy in cancer therapy; however, the emergence of drug resistance poses a considerable challenge to its efficacy. Most drug resistance arises from the accumulation of genetic mutations in a minority of resistant cells. The mechanisms underlying the emergence and progression of cancer resistance from these minority-resistant cells (MRCs) remain poorly understood. This study employs force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) alongside various biological investigations to reveal the mechanical pathways for MRCs fostering drug resistance and tumor progression. The findings show that minority Paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells have enhanced mechanical properties. These cells can transmit high-intensity forces to surrounding sensitive cells (SCs) through the force transducer, Merlin. This force transmission facilitates the assimilation of surrounding SCs, subsequently strengthening the contraction and adhesion of tumor cells. This process is termed \"mechano-assimilation,\" which accelerates the development of drug resistance and tumor progression. Interestingly, disturbances and reductions of mechano-assimilation within tumors can restore sensitivity to Paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting the contribution of MRCs to the development of drug resistance and malignancy, mediated through mechanical interactions. It also establishes a foundation for future research focused on integrating mechanical factors into innovative cancer therapies.",

  "abstract": "Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) holds significant promise for treating solid tumors but is often constrained by insufficient T-cell infiltration, survival, and functional persistence. To overcome these obstacles, we developed DON-loaded nanodrug-T cell conjugates with PD-L1 blockade, forging a dynamic mutualistic relationship between T cells and therapeutic agents. Sustained release of glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) within these conjugates continuously enhances T-cell endurance and potency by promoting memory differentiation and elevating crucial adhesion and motility genes. Concurrently, PD-L1 blocking peptides liberate T cells from immunosuppression, assisting T cells with precision toward tumor sites. This dual-targeting strategy-T cells directed at tumor antigens and peptides at PD-L1- enriches the tumor microenvironment with potent therapeutics, amplifying T cell-driven tumor destruction. Our approach effectively overcomes the critical barriers of ACT-infiltration, persistence, and efficacy-unlocking the full therapeutic potential of T-cell therapy against complex solid tumors.",
