  "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. This study investigates the clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, serotype distribution, and antibiotic resistance patterns in Vietnamese children aged 1-59 months with pneumococcal meningitis (PM). This retrospective study (2012-2023) was conducted at two tertiary pediatric hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City. CSF samples from probable bacterial meningitis (PBM) cases were analyzed using biochemistry, culture, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Serotyping and antibiotic-resistance genes were identified using quadriplex rt-PCR. Among 2922 PBM cases, 155 (5.3 %) were confirmed as PM. Of these, 58.7 % occurred in children under one year and 62.6 % during the rainy season. Fever (98.1 %) and vomiting (67.7 %) were the most common symptoms. Infants under 12 months frequently exhibited nonspecific signs like convulsions (48.4 %) and bulging fontanels (34.1 %), while older children displayed classic symptoms such as neck stiffness (32.4 %) and behavioral changes (26.5 %). CSF analysis revealed turbid appearance, WBC ≥ 100 cells/mm³ (85.2 %), and protein ≥ 1 g/L (60.0 %) (p < 0.05). Severe outcomes were noted in 17.4 % of PM cases, with a 3.2 % fatality rate. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes caused 81.3 % of confirmed cases, predominantly serotypes 6 A/B (34.8 %) and 19 F (20.0 %). Among 137 isolates tested, high prevalence rates were observed for the pbp2b (68.6 %), mef(A)/erm(B) (93.4 %), and tetM (92.0 %) resistance genes. Additionally, 61.3 % of isolates showed multiple resistance genes, particularly in serotypes 6 A/B, 23 F, 9 V, and 13. Antibiotic resistance in non-PCV13 serotypes increased over time. PM in Vietnamese children presents age-specific clinical presentations and is predominantly caused by highly resistant PCV13 serotypes. The rising resistance in non-PCV13 serotypes poses a formidable challenge in managing pneumococcal infections. These findings emphasize the urgent need for PCV introduction in the national immunization program and ongoing resistance surveillance.",

  "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can infect virtually any nucleated cell within human and other endoderm animal tissue, including male reproductive organs. Herein, we investigate the capacity of T. gondii tachyzoites to infect and proliferate within the testes and epididymis and examine the resulting impact on human spermatozoa structure and functionality. We confirmed that T. gondii tachyzoites colonise and proliferate within the testes and epididymis, altering the tissue structural homeostasis, and causing immune cell infiltration and cellular damage. In addition to demonstrating that T. gondii remains infective within the testes and epididymis, in vitro experiments demonstrated a direct interaction between T. gondii tachyzoites and human spermatozoa. This resulted in a significant proportion of headless spermatozoa. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed structural defects in spermatozoa, such as twisted tails and plasma membrane disruptions. Moreover, T. gondii tachyzoites triggered the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in spermatozoa without modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, and triggered cell death, pointing at mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mechanism mediating spermatozoan damage. Our findings suggest that T. gondii infection can have profound implications for male fertility by directly damaging spermatozoa and altering testicular and epididymal structures. The study underscores the need for further research to elucidate the long-term impact of T. gondii on male reproductive health, particularly in the context of iatrogenic infertility. Given the widespread seroprevalence of T. gondii in the human population, our research emphasises the importance of considering parasitic infections in diagnosing and managing male infertility in the field of andrology.",

This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with difficult-to-treat ABPA who failed to achieve clinical remission within 6 months. Among the participants of a nationwide survey conducted in Japan in 2020, treatment-naïve patients with ABPA who satisfied Asano's criteria were enrolled in this study. Clinical remission was defined as stable disease without exacerbation for ≥ 6 months under minimal treatment (oral prednisolone: ≤ 5 mg/day and no antifungal medication). A risk prediction score for difficult-to-treat ABPA was developed and validated in an independent cohort comprising patients with ABPA from a prospective registration study in Japan. In total, 316 treatment-naïve patients with ABPA were enrolled in the study. The median time to minimal treatment status was 4.8 months in the group receiving standard treatment. The clinical remission rate at 6 months after standard treatment was 51%. Age ≤ 50 years at onset of ABPA (p = 0.04), serum A. fumigatus-specific IgE titer of ≥ 20 U /mL (p = 0.006), positive culture for Aspergillus spp. in the sputum/bronchial lavage fluid (p = 0.05), and presence of high attenuation mucus (HAM; p = 0.10) were associated with difficult-to-treat ABPA. The number of positive indicators indicated the risk of failure of standard treatment to yield clinical remission within 6 months in the derivation (n = 87, p < 0.001) and validation (n = 64, p = 0.009) cohorts. Multiple components, including age at onset, allergic sensitization, airway fungal burden, and HAM, were associated with difficult-to-treat ABPA.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of two laboratory-developed assays (LDAs) and three commercially available real-time PCR assays for the detection of Candida auris. The analytical sensitivity, specificity and limit of detection (LOD) of each assay were assessed, alongside their clinical sensitivity in identifying C. auris colonisation. Ten C. auris strains representing five clades, as well as genetically related yeasts, common yeast species, and dermatophytes, were used to assess assay sensitivity and cross reactivity. Clinical and environmental samples were collected from patients during an outbreak and tested with three commercial PCR assays (AurisID, Fungiplex, FungiXpert) and two LDAs (CDC LDA, EMC LDA). LOD was determined using Probit analysis. Diagnostic sensitivity was evaluated by comparing the detection rate of each individual assay to the total detection rate of all assays combined. The EMC LDA exhibited the highest analytical sensitivity, with a LOD of 8 conidia/reaction, followed by CDC LDA (16 conidia/reaction), AurisID and FungiXpert (19 conidia/reaction), and Fungiplex (596 conidia/reaction). Specificity testing revealed cross-reactivity in the CDC LDA and AurisID assays with C. pseudohaemulonii at high conidia levels, while no cross-reactivity was observed in the other assays. EMC LDA showed the highest clinical sensitivity (100%), whereas Fungiplex had the lowest positivity rate (71%). No false positives were observed in negative control swabs for any assay. Real-time PCR is a crucial tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of C. auris , especially in clinical settings where timely identification is essential for effective patient management and infection control. Numerous PCR assays are available for this purpose; however, our study demonstrates that the sensitivity of these assays can vary significantly. The observed differences underscore the importance of establishing international reference standards and proficiency panels to enhance the accuracy and comparability of assay performance across different studies and laboratories.",

  "abstract": "Nursing homes (NHs) were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known regarding the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in NH residents and staff, which could inform treatment and infection prevention. We enrolled NH residents and staff in eight US states from April to November 2023 and analyzed the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 using serial antigen and molecular (RT-PCR) tests, whole genome sequencing, and viral culture (VC). Symptoms, vaccination, and treatment were collected via interviews and chart review. Viral load trajectories were modeled with gamma distribution functional forms. Antigen and VC test positivity over time were assessed using a Chi-squared test. Of the 587 enrolled participants, 86 tested positive and 73 underwent testing for ≥ 10 days; most residents (78%) and staff (87%) had ≥ 3 COVID-19 vaccine doses. The modeled SARS-CoV-2 proliferation period (period prior to reaching peak viral load) had ended for 48% (14/29) of residents and 56% (9/16) of staff when they took the initial RT-PCR test. Both antigen and VC showed higher positivity rates early in the course of disease (Days 0-5 vs. Days ≥ 6) (antigen: p < 0·001, VC: p < 0·001). VC positivity was 15% after Day 5 (14/96); two participants were VC positive after Day 10. Peak viral load occurs early in the disease, suggesting asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may be a significant driver of transmission. Only two participants had a positive VC after Day 10, supporting current isolation and return to work recommendations.",

We aimed to assess the performance of a novel blood-based test leveraging DNA methylation patterns for simultaneous detection of lung (LC), breast (BrC), colorectal (CRC), and prostate (PCa) cancer. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) methylation data, we identified shared hypermethylated gene promoters (ADCY4, MIR129-2, NID2, and MAGI2) among those four cancers. Validation was performed using online datasets, an in-house tissue set (N = 179), and plasma samples (N = 485) using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The test showed sensitivities of 81.82% (lung), 45% (breast), 69.23% (colorectal), and 44.14% (prostate), with 91.04% specificity. Overall, the PanCancer panel achieved 60.1% sensitivity and 87.4% specificity in detecting these four cancers. In early-stage cancers, sensitivities were slightly lower but followed a similar trend. Additionally, the test detected nine other cancer types in plasma. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of a single methylation-targeted blood test for multi-cancer detection, offering potential as an affordable and scalable screening tool for early cancer detection.",

  "abstract": "The burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its provincial trends in Iran remain unknown. Herein, we explore PD data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study nationally and provincially from 1990 to 2021. We used age-standardized incidence (ASIR), prevalence (ASPR), and mortality (ASMR) rates to determine disparities and trends overall and by sex, age, and geographic locations. Univariate analysis and regression were performed to scrutinize the mean differences and associations between socioeconomic factors and different PD outcomes. The ASIR and ASPR of PD increased by 23.1% and 33.2%, respectively, from 1990 to 2021, with estimated total percentage change (TPC) of 0.50 (95%CU: 0.58-0.43) and 0.30 (0.37-0.24), respectively. In 2021, East Azarbayejan had the highest ASIR and ASPR. From 1999 to 2021, the ASMR decreased significantly across individuals aged below 85 years nationally. Overall, 71.0% provinces experienced a downward trend in the ASMR, with the highest decrease in the TPC (-0.21,-0.37-0.01) occurring in Markazi. Significant differences in the PD outcomes between males and females were noted (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive association between the ASPR and the human development index (HDI), urbanization rate, and annual income per rural households. From 1999 to 2021, the incidence and prevalence of PD in Iran and its provinces increased significantly regardless of age and sex classification. Intervention and screening programs should continue to reduce mortality from PD in Iran, but with different priorities between provinces.",

  "abstract": "Melanoma poses a significant health concern due to its propensity to metastasize and its high mortality rate. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for harnessing the patient's immune system to fight tumor cells. However, not all patients respond equally to immunotherapy, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers to identify potential responders and optimize treatment strategies. Using data from 579 immunology-related genes evaluated by the NanoString nCounter Human Immunology v2 Panel, we integrated transcriptomic data with the clinical characteristics of 35 individuals to develop a predictive signature for immunotherapy response in melanoma patients. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified 18 genes upregulated in non-responder patients and three upregulated in responder patients. In multivariate analysis, CD24, NFIL3, FN1, and KLRK1 were identified as key predictors with significant potential for forecasting treatment outcomes. We then calculated a score incorporating the expression levels of these genes. The score achieved high accuracy in discriminating responders from non-responders, with an area under the curve of 0.935 (p < 0.001). The signature was also significantly associated with progression-free survival, overall survival, and survival following immunotherapy (p < 0.001). The validation of the signature in two independent cohorts confirmed its robustness and applicability, with areas under the curve of 0.758 (p = 0.036) and 0.833 (p = 0.004), respectively. This study represents a significant advance in precision medicine for melanoma. By identifying patients unlikely to benefit from immunotherapy, our approach could help optimize treatment allocation and improve patient outcomes. KEY MESSAGES: Novel 4-gene signature predicts immunotherapy failure in melanoma. High accuracy for personalized treatment decisions. Signature associated with decreased survival for non-responders. Signature validated in independent cohorts, enhancing generalizability. Potential to tailor treatment strategies and avoid unnecessary burden to patients.",

  "abstract": "Goose astrovirus (GAstV) is an emerging pathogen that is widely distributed throughout China and can cause visceral gout, resulting in serious economic losses for the goose industry. Open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of this virus encodes the precursor capsid protein, which is essential for the assembly and antigenicity of these virions. To construct a bi-valent vaccine for controlling GAstV and duck enteritis virus (DEV) infection, an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of the DEV vaccine strain pDEV-EF1 was used to establish a recombinant DEV vector for GAstV ORF2 gene delivery. GAstV ORF2 expression frame was inserted into the US7 and US8 intergenic region of DEV genome by Red E/T two-step recombinant technology, then the recombinant virus rDEV-GAstV ORF2 was rescued by transfecting recombinant clone pDEV-GAstV ORF2 into chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs). The expression of ORF2 in CEFs and formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) were analysed by Western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and immunogold electron microscopy (IEM), individually. And protein celluar localization was analysed by IFA. Using this rDEV-GAstV ORF2 vector to infect CEFs was sufficient to elicit GAstV Cap protein expression, as confirmed by Western blotting and IFA. IEM also revealed the formation of VLPs within cells expressing this Cap protein. DEV is a good viral vector for GAstV ORF2 gene delivery and these results provide a basis for the development of a bivalent vaccine for controlling DEV and GAstV infections.",

  "abstract": "Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and tuberculosis (TB) pose significant risks to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving biological therapy. However, data on the prevalence of these infections in Syria are scarce. We conducted a retrospective chart review of IBD patients receiving biologic therapy at Damascus Hospital and Ibn Al-Nafees Hospital, two major public institutions in Syria, between January 2021 and November 2024. A minimum sample size of 130 was estimated; however, all available records were reviewed. Among 185 IBD patients (104 from Damascus and 81 from Ibn Al-Nafees), 51.4% had ulcerative colitis and 47.6% had Crohn's disease. The smoking prevalence was 9.2%, which was higher in Crohn's disease (5.9%) than in ulcerative colitis (3.2%). TST performed in 61.1% of patients, with 4.3% positivity, and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) in 8.7% (1.1% positive). Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBc antibodies were found in 2.7% and 5.4% of the patients, respectively, while hepatitis C seroprevalence was low (0.5%). CMV seropositivity was high in Damascus (50.8%), with two cases (1.1%) of CMV colitis. Biologic therapies included infliximab (42.7%), ustekinumab (24.3%), golimumab (10.8%), and adalimumab (6.5%). Data gaps, particularly in viral serology and TB screening, are notable. This study identifies deficiencies in TB/hepatitis B screening (notably anti-HBs Ab) and elevated CMV seroprevalence among Syrian IBD patients receiving biologics, extending to immunosuppressed cohorts (rheumatology, dermatology, oncology). Insufficient screening heightens occult infection/reactivation risks, necessitating standardized pretreatment protocols to reduce morbidity in high-risk populations. Not applicable.",

This comprehensive review aims to enhance the understanding of pruritus by highlighting important elements in its pathogenesis, including keratinocytes, Merkel cells and mast cells, nerve fibers, histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pathways, and the interaction of itch signals with the central nervous system. Diagnostic evaluation of chronic pruritus may require a meticulous approach, guided by the identification of skin lesions or signs/symptoms of underlying systemic diseases. A comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed medical history, thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and imaging tests, often supplemented by skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence, is essential. Treatment strategies for chronic pruritus should be individualized based on the etiology identified. General measures, such as emollients, serve as initial interventions, followed by targeted approaches. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, and systemic immunosuppressants address cutaneous inflammation. Antihistamines, antidepressants, and immunosuppressants may be employed based on the specific etiology. Emerging therapies, including biologic drugs and JAK inhibitors, have potential in refractory cases.",

  "abstract": "Multiple rare diagnoses in the neuroinflammatory disease spectrum are associated with a high morbidity and mortality and are refractory to systemic immunotherapies. Owing to disease rarity, there are often barriers or delays in introducing novel treatment protocols. The development of institutional treatment protocols helps to ensure consistent and improved efficiency to help ensure optimal patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary team with aligned interests was created and aided in identifying the need for a new treatment regimen for patients with treatment refractory neuroinflammatory disease. This work group was convened to determine a standardized template for the management of patients requiring intrathecal therapy. After review and assessment of existing clinical case reports, and other supporting documents, the workgroup reached a consensus regarding optimal treatment approaches, created methods for distribution, and education of providers to utilize the developed clinical template. We document our process for creating and implementing a treatment protocol for intrathecal (IT) dexamethasone in children with treatment-refractory neuroinflammatory disease. The treatment protocol was approved by key stakeholders across multiple disciplines as part of a collaborative effort to improve outcomes. We describe eight patients with neuroinflammatory disease treated with IT dexamethasone without adverse events. There are many barriers in the introduction of novel treatment protocols in rare disease. Utilization of a multidisciplinary team can help identify barriers and facilitate protocol development, leading to alternative treatment pathways in those with rare disease. The development of a standardized treatment approach can be an important way to ensure adequate and effective treatment of patients with rare disorders. The implementation process requires institutions to dedicate resources to ensure key stakeholder input to address barriers to implementation, and to provide ongoing input following implementation to assess patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Snails are mollusks or shelled gastropods found everywhere on Earth. Biologically, snail mucus can be described as a multifunctional natural polymeric gel with adhesive and antimicrobial properties, rendering it a promising ingredient in pharmaceutics and biomedical applications. These properties have been exploited in cosmetics and dermatology applications over the last few years. However, the exploration of snail mucus for other biomedical applications, e.g., wound healing and drug delivery, remains new and very promising. Against this backdrop, this review explores the potential of snail mucus for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications, ranging from wound healing to cancer treatment to regenerative engineering. It will be emphasized how its application in wound healing has gained traction owing to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Beyond wound care, snail mucus has been investigated as a drug delivery vehicle in treating diabetes and targeted cancer therapies. While further extensive research and clinical trials are needed to solidify the efficacy of snail mucus as a biomaterial, this review will shed light on the prospect of using snail mucus alone and in combination with other natural or synthetic biopolymers as soft materials for widespread biomedical applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exploring snail mucus as a biomaterial across various fields, including oncology, drug delivery, cosmetics, antibacterial properties, and wound healing, presents a fascinating avenue for zootherapy research. This review provides an in-depth account of the recent developments in snail mucus' potential for a broad spectrum of biomedical applications, from wound healing to cancer treatment and regenerative engineering. It highlights the growing interest in mucus' use in wound healing, attributed to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has also been investigated as a drug delivery vehicle for diabetes treatment and targeted cancer therapies. The impact of such research is significant, as it could lead to the creation of innovative biomaterials for a wide range of applications, revolutionizing the field of biomaterials.",

  "abstract": "With the advent of disease-modifying therapies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD), a comprehensive characterization of patients initiating lecanemab in the USA is needed to understand its use in real-world settings. This retrospective observational study used administrative claims from the Komodo Research Database (1/1/2023-6/30/2024). Eligible patients had ≥ 1 lecanemab administration (first claim defined the index date) and ≥ 12 months of clinical activity/insurance eligibility before the index date. Patient characteristics, diagnostic process, and AD-related medications were evaluated within 12 months before the index date (baseline), whereas lecanemab treatment patterns and concomitant medications were evaluated on or after the index date (follow-up). Outcomes were reported using descriptive statistics and persistence to lecanemab was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of 3155 patients included in the study, mean age was 75.0 years, 55.8% were female, 44.2% were male, and most (93.3%) received their index lecanemab administration in an urban setting. Diagnoses of AD (83.8%) and mild cognitive impairment (60.8%) were common at baseline, and 67.6% of patients used AD symptomatic medications. Average time from earliest diagnosis to first lecanemab administration was 4.9 months among patients with a diagnosis in January 2023 (accelerated approval date) or onwards. Over a mean follow-up of 138.8 days, the monthly mean number of administrations of lecanemab was 1.9, with an average of 16.5 days between consecutive administrations and 47.4 days to the first follow-up head magnetic resonance imaging. Persistence to lecanemab was 87.6% at 4 months after treatment initiation. Lecanemab was utilized in appropriate patient populations according to the prescribing information approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Findings from our study provide first insights into the real-world use of lecanemab in the USA and shed light on the need for increased and timely lecanemab initiation for the long-term management of early AD.",

In this international, multicenter, open-label phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab in stage IIB-IV refractory/relapsed MF and SS. Patients received atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3w for up to 1 year unless progression or withdrawal. The main study endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next systemic treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS). A total of 26 patients were enrolled from seven countries. Seventeen patients met the inclusion criteria. At a median follow-up of 36.6 months, the ORR was 15.4 % in the intention to treat (ITT) and 17.6 % in the per protocol (PP) population, respectively. In the PP group, 58.8 % of patients, and in the ITT group, 53.9 % of patients achieved partial response or stable disease as their best outcome. One complete response was observed after 1 year. Median PFS was 3 months (95 % CI 1.4-4.9) in PP and 3.1 months (95 % CI 2.4-4.0) in ITT. Median OS was not reached for PP and was 22.3 months (20.0-NE) for ITT. Median TTNT was 5.9 months (2.8-NE) in PP and 6.2 months (3.1-14.8) in ITT. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were fatigue (23.1 %) and infections (15.4 %), with two sepsis-related deaths. Atezolizumab was primarily discontinued due to disease progression (50 %). Atezolizumab shows moderate activity in pretreated refractory/relapsed MF and SS. Further studies are needed to identify reliable predictors of safety and treatment response.",

  "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most prevalent genetic kidney disorder, is characterized by diffuse kidney cysts, hypertension, and progressive kidney function decline, often leading to kidney failure by the age of 60 years. Compared with the general population, patients with ADPKD have an increased risk for development of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IAs), which can lead to intracranial bleeding and result in significant disability and mortality. Of both modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, the most significant is a family history of IAs or aneurysm rupture. Other contributing factors include hypertension, cigarette smoking, age, and sex. Most IAs currently detected during screening tests are small and located in the anterior circulation. Intracranial aneurysms can be manifested with thunderclap headache, which may be indicative of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Less commonly, IAs cause symptoms related to mass effect with focal neurologic deficits. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is particularly concerning, given its high case-fatality rate, which remains around 35% despite advances in neurologic care. Therefore, control of risk factors, early detection, and treatment when indicated are important to prevent adverse outcomes. Screening for IAs in ADPKD remains controversial and can be approached either universally (screening of all ADPKD patients) or selectively (screening of high-risk patients). The preferred imaging modality is brain magnetic resonance angiography without contrast enhancement or alternatively computed tomography angiography. This review provides a practical guide for medical teams managing patients with ADPKD, detailing the characteristics of IAs and their associated symptoms. It presents an algorithm for risk assessment and screening along with recommendations for treatment and follow-up care.",

  "abstract": "Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, offers advantages in psoriasis patients in whom biologics are not approved or accepted and where topical treatments have failed. Psoriasis involving the nails, scalp, and genitals is difficult to treat and is associated with a significant decrease in quality of life, requiring an effective treatment. This study aimed to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg twice daily in treating psoriasis limited to the nails. The charts of 55 adult patients with nail psoriasis treated with apremilast were retrospectively evaluated. Baseline characteristics, including the nail psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI), were recorded. At 6 months of treatment, a statistically significant decrease in both the NAPSI score (44.7 ± 26.9 vs. 19.03 ± 14.2) and the DLQI score (14.5 ± 5 vs. 7.2 ± 4.1) was observed (p < 0.01). None of the patients discontinued the treatment due to side effects. This study shows improvements in nail psoriasis severity and quality of life with apremilast treatment. Despite potential confounders like psoriatic arthritis, smoking, and manual work, consistent improvements were observed. Apremilast appears to be a valuable treatment option for nail psoriasis. However, further prospective studies are necessary to address the limitations of this retrospective analysis and explore additional endpoints.",

  "abstract": "Tumor-related trigeminal neuralgia (TRTN) accounts for approximately 6% of all facial pain syndromes. Conventional medical treatments have short-term pain relief effects in TRTN cases; however, they are correlated with substantial failure rates of 63-100%. Microsurgical resection (MS) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are the two primary therapeutic options for the management of TRTNs. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the pain-related outcomes and complications of SRS in TRTNs. A systematic literature search was conducted on February 24, 2025, comparing PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies reporting pain-related outcomes and adverse radiation effects (ARE) for SRS in TRTNs were included. Nineteen studies with 454 patients were included. Meningioma (67.7%, 304/449) was the most common tumor, followed by vestibular schwannoma (VS) (18.3%, 82/449) and trigeminal schwannoma (8.2%, 37/449). Our meta-analysis demonstrated that SRS is associated with a pooled complete pain-free rate of 38% (95% CI: 27-50%), an adequate pain relief rate of 73% (95% CI: 63-83%), and an ARE rate of 14% (95% CI: 7-22%). In those where the underlying etiology was pertoclival meningiomas, SRS resulted in a pooled complete pain-free rate of 30% (95%CI: 5-64%), an adequate complete pain relief rate of 64% (95%CI: 33-90%), and an ARE rate of 13% (95%CI: 0-48%). SRS is associated with favorable pain-related outcomes and low ARE rates in patients with TRTN. Both tumor-only related and dual-targeted approaches are associated with comparable outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Microneedles (MNs) have been extensively used as transdermal therapeutics delivery devices since 1998 due to their capacity to penetrate physiological barriers with minimal invasiveness. Recent advances demonstrate the potential of MNs in improving diverse tissue regeneration when integrated with nanometer-sized therapeutics or sensors. This synergistic strategy can enhance drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic outcomes, and enable precise and personalized therapies through real-time monitoring of the repair process. In this review, we discuss how optimized MNs (through adjustments in geometry, material properties, and modular structure), when combined with dimension- and composition-specific nanomaterials, enhance tissue regeneration efficiency. Moreover, integrating stimuli-responsive nanotherapeutics or nanosensors into MNs for spatiotemporal-controlled and targeted drug release, physiotherapy effects, and intelligent monitoring is systematically outlined. Furthermore, we summarize therapeutic applications of nanotherapeutics-MN platforms in various soft and hard tissues, including skin, hair follicles (HF), cornea, joint, tendons, sciatic nerves, spinal cord, periodontium, oral mucosa, myocardium, endometrium, bone and intervertebral discs (IVD). Notably, recent attempts using nanosensor-MN platforms as smart wearable devices for monitoring damaged tissues via interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and biomarker sensing are analyzed. This review potentially provides tissue regeneration practitioners/researchers with a cross-disciplinary perspective and inspiration.",

  "abstract": "Seeking medical attention promptly after an acute stroke is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, delayed medical intervention after acute stroke contributes to increased mortality and morbidity. This study explored factors that contribute to the delayed appearance of stroke patients at the emergency department. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted for 9 months at a referral hospital in Addis Ababa. Data was collected using questionnaires administered to stroke patients or their caregivers upon their arrival at the emergency department. Electronic medical records were further reviewed, and the treating physicians described the subsequent management of the patient after their arrival at the emergency department. Data was analyzed using descriptive and analytic parameters. Only 33.3% (n = 30) arrived at the emergency department within 4.5 h. Hemorrhagic stroke was a statistically significant predictor of early presentation to the emergency department (OR = 3.182; 95% CI (1.258-8.046); p = 0.036). The absence of any substance was another marginally significant predictor for early appearance (OR = 2.555; 95% (0.936-6.970); p = 0.067). One of the marginally significant predictors for late presentation was low drug adherence (OR = 0.224; 95% CI (0.48-1.044); p = 0.057). The other factors attributed to the time of arrival, though not statistically significant, were level of education, perception of stroke as a serious illness, and prior number of health visits before arrival to the emergency department. The study found that many of the factors that cause delays in getting to the hospital can be changed, except for the type of stroke. Time spent in the hospital could also be positively impacted by the intervention from the appropriate authorities.",

Given the high incidence and often limited treatment options, understanding the complexity of the BrM tumor microenvironment is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We performed transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling combined with spatial immune cell profiling to characterize the tumor immune microenvironment in 95 patients with BrM from different primary tumors. We found that BrM from lung carcinoma and malignant melanoma showed overall higher immune cell infiltration as compared to BrM from breast carcinoma. RNA sequencing-based immune cell deconvolution revealed gene expression signatures indicative of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in subsets of BrM, mostly from lung cancer and melanoma. This finding was corroborated by multiplex immunofluorescence staining of immune cells in BrM tissue sections. Detection of TLS signatures was more common in treatment-naïve BrM and associated with prolonged survival after BrM diagnosis in lung cancer patients. Our findings highlight the cellular diversity of the tumor immune microenvironment in BrM of different cancer types and suggest a role of TLS formation for BrM patient outcome.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of the nervous system, leading to impaired motor and non-motor functions. Early symptoms include tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, with progressive deterioration over time. This study employs a multi-criteria decision-making approach, integrating Fuzzy TOPSIS and Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) analysis, to evaluate and rank 17 Parkinson's disease medications based on their physicochemical properties. Molecular structures were encoded as adjacency matrices using MATLAB 2017, and six Sombor index variants-computed via a custom Maple 2020 algorithm-served as topological descriptors for QSPR modeling. Eight critical physicochemical properties were analyzed: polarizability (P), boiling point (BP), surface tension (ST), polar surface area (PSA), flash point (FP), molar refractivity (MR), enthalpy of vaporization (EV), and molar volume (MV). The Fuzzy TOPSIS ranking revealed bromocriptine as the top-performing drug for boiling point (BP), while comparative rankings across all properties are tabulated for clinical reference. Validation metrics, including coefficient of determination, mean squared error , and mean absolute error, confirmed model robustness. Notably, surface tension (ST) and polar surface area (PSA) showed weaker correlations (R  < 0.5, p > 0.05), highlighting limitations in their predictability via Sombor indices. This work demonstrates the utility of combining chemical graph theory, QSPR modeling, and Fuzzy TOPSIS for rational drug evaluation in neurodegenerative disorders. The methodology offers a framework for prioritizing therapeutics based on physicochemical profiles, with implications for optimizing Parkinson's disease management.",

  "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a common chemotherapeutic agent, is often associated with dose-limiting hepatotoxicity. Alamandine, a peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may counteract these adverse effects. This study investigated the protective effects of alamandine on DOX-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats received DOX (3.75 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on days 14, 21, 28, and 35, reaching a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg. Alamandine (50 µg/kg/day) was administered continuously via mini-osmotic pumps for 42 days. Liver toxicity was assessed through biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, and liver enzymes, as well as histological examination. DOX administration significantly increased serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while reducing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity. Histological analysis revealed hydropic degeneration and hepatocyte necrosis. Alamandine co-treatment restored SOD and CAT activity, reduced MDA and inflammatory markers, and normalized liver enzyme levels, indicating significant hepatoprotection. Furthermore, treatment with alamandine reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, and NF-κB induced by DOX, while p53 expression remained unchanged. Alamandine effectively mitigates DOX-induced hepatotoxicity, demonstrating its therapeutic potential as an adjunctive agent in chemotherapy through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.",

We found that these new susceptibility loci exhibit sex- and age-specific effect on aging skin risk as well as implicated in interactions with modifiable risk factors including water intake, micronutrient care, sleeping habits, sun exposure and application of sunscreen cream, in the development of an increased risk of aging skin.

  "abstract": "This study aims to identify neighborhood-level inequities in prehospital stroke care, including EMS utilization and last known well (LKW) to ED presentation, in a small state with one large comprehensive stroke center. This was a retrospective observational study using 2 years of data (2020-2022) from Get With The Guidelines combined with data collected by a large hospital system in Rhode Island that includes a comprehensive stroke center (CSC), the Rhode Island emergency management system database, and 2020 census data. Census tract disadvantage was significantly associated with LKW to ED arrival times, with individuals from more disadvantaged neighborhoods presenting almost a full hour later than individuals from the least disadvantaged neighborhoods (56.9 min, 95% confidence interval 14.9-90.3 min). EMS use was the strongest predictor of LKW to ED arrival times, and the Latinx population was significantly less likely to utilize EMS compared to the White population. Understanding geographical inequities in stroke recognition and prehospital stroke care can help mitigate important socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities. In addition, geospatial analysis provides useful information for targeting intervention strategies to neighborhoods with the longest LKW to ED arrival times and lowest use of EMS.",

  "abstract": "Transcatheter device closure is the method of choice for the closure of secundum atrial septal defects (ASD) with appropriate anatomic characteristics, leading to symptomatic relief, increased survival rates, cardiac remodeling, and improved cardiac function. Assessing the impact of transcatheter ASD closure on echocardiographic indices and comparing them between individuals younger and older than 50. In this retrospective cohort study, 240 patients with isolated secundum ASD and complete documentation and follow-up data who underwent transcatheter device closure between 2015 and 2019 were included. Demographic, peri-procedural, and echocardiographic findings were compared before and after the procedure and among two age groups. A total of 240 patients (68% female, 44% younger than 50) with a median age of 51 underwent transcatheter ASD closure. ASD closure led to a significant decline in the size of four cardiac chambers and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP), in addition to a significant improvement in biventricular systolic function, LV diastolic function, and valvular insufficiencies. Although patients aged 50 and older had worse LV diastolic and RV systolic function, in addition to larger RV size and bi-atrial dimensions at the baseline, the extent of improvement of these parameters among them was significantly more pronounced than those younger than 50. There were no significant differences in the extent of the decline in SPAP between the two groups. Transcatheter ASD device closure is a beneficial procedure with high success rates and low complication rates among older individuals, eventually leading to improvements in cardiac form and function.",

  "abstract": "Pneumonia represents a significant global health burden with high morbidity and mortality rates, despite advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies. Airway clearance techniques (ACT), including High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), are critical in managing respiratory conditions. However, the combined effectiveness of BiPAP and HFCWO in treating adult pneumonia remains underexplored. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a college hospital in southern Taiwan, enrolling patients aged ≥ 18 years, admitted for pneumonia from January 2020 to December 2022, who received HFCWO therapy for ≥ 5 days in the ordinary ward. Exclusion criteria included prior mechanical ventilation before HFCWO initiation. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the effectiveness of the combined use of BiPAP and HFCWO. A total of 271 patients received HFCWO and were enrolled for analysis, including 163 patients who received both BiPAP and HFCWO. Patients receiving both BiPAP and HFCWO were associated with decreased frequency of sputum suction (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.46-5.78, P = 0.002), and reduced oxygen need post-HFCWO (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.91, P = 0.021). However, there was no difference in hospital stay, respiratory failure, ICU admission, or hospital death between the groups. Additionally, there was no difference in these outcomes for patients who received HFCWO twice daily compared to those who received it once daily. Combining BiPAP and HFCWO reduces the need for sputum suction and improves oxygen demand for patients but does not change hospital days, respiratory failure, or mortality. Further large prospective cohort studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this management approach.",

  "abstract": "Intellectual disability is the subject of interest of psychiatry and special education. Both sciences in Poland adopt an inclusive model of care for people with disabilities. The path of each of them from a directive model to an inclusive model has been different. The aim of the study is to compare the attitude towards people with intellectual disabilities and the evolution of changes that have taken place in Polish special education and in Polish psychiatry in the last few decades. The comparison was carried out using the narrative method through a review of key publications on the understanding of the intellectual disability phenomenon by special education in Poland and by psychiatry. In 1989, Polish special education departed from dialectical materialism as a binding doctrine in the social sciences. A postmodern understanding of the phenomenon of disability, culminating in the formulation of a humanistic paradigm of special education consisting of four microparadigms, developed instead. Special education moved away from quantitative research in favor of qualitative research, negating the biomedical aspects of disability. Qualitative and conceptual research studies carried out in Poland have not entered the global circulation of scientific information and are known locally in Poland. Polish psychiatry has undergone a less revolutionary path of change than special education. The development of community psychiatry in Western Europe slowly began to be implemented in Poland. It has been implemented in recent years in the form of mental health centers. Since the beginning of the political transformation, Polish psychiatry has been present in international journals in published English with the Impact Factor. Despite the postmodern, inclusive understanding of mental disorders, but in contrast to Polish special education, Polish psychiatry is based on quantitative research studies. Their results are published in international journals. Polish special pedagogy of people with intellectual disabilities, as well as Polish psychiatry, have undergone a significant paradigmatic reconstruction in the last few decades. Both sciences adopted an inclusive model of understanding intellectual disability. The different ways of development of the two sciences are reflected in publications and scientific research, as well as in certain terminological differences.",

  "abstract": "Females have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The innate immune system plays a key role in AD pathology, and sex differences in innate immune responses may contribute to differences in disease risk and progression. This study investigated sex differences in innate immune responses among participants without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) determined amyloid pathology [A-; cognitively normal (CN),   = 83] and those with amyloid pathology (A+,   = 202), further stratified into preclinical (CN with A+,   = 72) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI with A+,   = 130). Participants were drawn from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort (  = 285). We measured plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CSF concentrations of nine innate immune markers: soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), fractalkine, chitinase 3-like 1 (YKL-40), clusterin, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-18. Linear regression was used, adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. In A+ cases (  = 202, females = 105), females had lower MCP-1 (     0.01), IL-6 and IL-18 (both      0.05) than males, while no sex differences were observed in A- cases (  = 83, females = 39). Among A+ participants, no sex differences were observed in CN cases (  = 72, females = 37), but females (  = 68) with MCI had lower MCP-1 and IL-6 (both      0.05) than males (  = 62) with MCI. Moreover, A+ females exhibited stronger positive associations between sTREM2 and clusterin with CSF total tau (  < 0.001;   < 0.05) and Neurofilament light chain (  < 0.01;   < 0.01) than males. These findings suggest sex-specific differences in innate immune responses, which may contribute to disease progression in amyloid-positive individuals.",

However, the mechanisms underlying primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the biomarkers associated with primary resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs was defined as disease progression within 90 days (3 months) of treatment in patients with EGFR-sensitive mutant adenocarcinoma without any evidence of objective response. Retrospective, single-center study. This study retrospectively screened patients with NSCLC who received EGFR-TKIs at Hunan Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. According to pre-determined clinical outcomes, we divided the patients into primary resistance and sensitivity groups. Only patients with sufficient samples that passed quality control were included in this study. Tumor tissue and paired peripheral blood samples collected from patients before treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing using an 825-gene panel. In addition, tumor tissue samples were analyzed for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this study, with 35 in each of the primary resistant and sensitive groups. Patients with exon 4 mutations in the   gene had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those without the mutation.   and   mutation frequencies were substantially higher in the primary resistant group and were associated with shorter PFS and OS. Furthermore, patients in the primary resistant group exhibited substantially higher levels of PD-L1 expression. The potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs are highly heterogeneous. Combining some somatic variants affecting tumor function and high PD-L1 expression may contribute to this resistance.",

  "abstract": "Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in elderly patients is a common and life-threatening condition, often complicated by comorbidities. The ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin (RAR) has recently been proposed as a prognostic marker in various diseases, but its role in predicting adverse outcomes in GIB patients remains unclear. A total of 51,824 aged 65 years or older patients were initially screened for inclusion in the study. After excluding those lost to follow-up, with missing vital information during the screening period (n = 50,423), 1401 hospitalized patients with GIB in Beijing Hospital (2013-2019) were included. Restricted cubic spline modeling and logistic regression analyses assessed the relationships between RAR, adverse outcomes, and in hospital mortality. Among the 1, 401 patients, 648 experienced adverse outcomes, and 427 patients died during hospitalization. Higher RAR was significantly associated with an increased risk of both in-hospital mortality and adverse outcomes, even after adjusting for age, sex, education level, body mass index (BMI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), white blood cell count (WBC), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin, heart failure, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and heart rate. RAR is a novel and independent predictor of mortality and adverse outcomes in elderly patients with GIB. Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness make it a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patients. Further studies in larger, multicenter cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the clinical benefits of RAR-based interventions.",

  "abstract": "Advanced care planning (ACP) and advance medical directives (AMDs) are vital for aligning medical decisions with patient preferences, particularly for end-of-life care. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment in India established the legality of AMDs, enabling patients to exercise their autonomy. Recent amendments in 2023 simplified procedural requirements, replacing judicial magistrate approval with a streamlined two-tier medical board system. This article proposes a culturally sensitive and practical 12-step framework for implementing ACP and AMDs in India. A structured and consensus-driven process was undertaken by experts in palliative medicine, neurology, critical care, and geriatrics, supported by key medical organizations. The development process included multiple iterations, public consultations, and feedback from legal and medical stakeholders. The framework integrates legal, ethical, and cultural considerations to address procedural and systemic challenges in ACP implementation. The proposed 12-step pathway focuses on three phases: creating living wills, periodic reviews and updates, and executing AMDs. Key components include initiating discussions, identification and appointment of surrogate decision-makers, ensuring legal compliance through simplified procedures, and providing guidance for withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments. Implementation strategies emphasize public awareness, provider training, and institutional policies to normalize ACP. Simplified legal requirements introduced in 2023 facilitate broader adoption and reduce procedural barriers. This framework provides a practical, culturally relevant model for ACP in India, ensuring patient-centered, ethical, and transparent end-of-life care. By integrating simplified legal procedures and addressing misconceptions through education and policy initiatives, the proposed approach empowers individuals, families, and healthcare providers to make informed decisions, fostering dignity and autonomy in medical care.

  "abstract": "This study aimed to present our early experience with minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) circuits and compare it with conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (cCPB). Two hundred thirty-nine patient registries (169 males, 70 females; mean age: 63.5 years) who underwent surgery were retrospectively analyzed between June 2021 and February 2024. All patients were operated by the same surgical team with a restrictive blood transfusion protocol. Forty-five (18.8%) cases were identified as MiECC. Most of the operations were coronary artery bypass grafting. Significant differences were observed between those operated on with MiECC and cCPB regarding the transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) suspensions and the total amount of drainage. No significant differences were observed in the duration of intubation, incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury, and intensive care unit or hospital stay. In geriatric patients, transfusion of RBC suspensions and drainage was significantly lower. Duration of intubation and intensive care unit or hospital stay did not reach statistical significance. In patients with an ejection fraction ≤45, transfusion of RBC suspensions were similarly low. The utilization of MiECC resulted in a reduction in transfusion of RBC suspensions and postoperative drainage. No significant differences were observed in intubation time, postoperative acute kidney injury, hospitalization, or mortality. Although intubation time was observed to be shorter, no statistically significant result could be reached. There is a potential for bias in patient selection due to the potential benefits of MiECC. We believe that with a larger number of blinded studies, the benefits of MiECC can be demonstrated in more detail, particularly in specialized populations such as geriatric patients and patients with low EF.",

While comorbidities have been shown as predictors of poor pneumonia outcomes, the interplay between chronic comorbidities and acute physiological conditions, reflected by systemic biomarkers, remains underexplored. This study investigates the independent and joint effects of dementia and acute biomarkers on 30-day readmission risk following pneumonia hospitalization. We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from three hospitals within the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database. Patients aged ≥45 years hospitalized for pneumonia between 2014 and 2021 were included. Dementia status was identified via ICD-9/10 codes, and acute systemic biomarkers were measured at the time of emergency department presentation. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause readmission. Multivariable logistic regression assessed independent associations, while joint-effects models examined the combined impact of dementia with biomarker abnormalities and comorbidities. Among 11,989 patients, 6.7% experienced 30-day readmission. Dementia was independently associated with readmission (adjusted OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.61). Other significant predictors included abnormal hemoglobin (OR: 1.55), creatinine (OR: 1.42), glucose (OR: 1.32), and comorbidities such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Joint-effects models showed that dementia amplified the impact of abnormal biomarkers, eg, patients with low hemoglobin and dementia had an OR of 1.98 compared to those with normal hemoglobin and no dementia. Dementia and acute biomarker abnormalities independently and synergistically increase 30-day readmission risk after pneumonia hospitalization, underscoring the need for integrated management strategies targeting both cognitive and systemic health.",

  "abstract": " Cancer treatments are not a one-size-fits-all approach, treatment options are rarely studied in aging individuals, leading to worse outcomes related to increased vulnerability in this group of patients.   Since frailty has shown the ability to modify outcomes, our study aims to assess if frailty modifies the association between performance status and days in bed with mortality risk in older adults with cancer.   Our study is a secondary analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study, a cohort with a representative sample of individuals aged 50 years or older, with a baseline assessment in 2001 and follow-up data available for the years 2003, 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021. We extracted the baseline variables from the main questionnaires, and the next-of-kin questionnaires were employed for information regarding mortality. We used Cox regression and Kaplan‒Meier curves for survival analysis.   Our sample was composed of 318 individuals, with a mean age of 68.02 years (± SD 10.78), and 62.57% were women. Cox regression revealed that age was a significant risk factor for mortality in frail patients but not in those with low frailty levels.   in settings where access to a geriatric assessment is limited or would significantly delay cancer-specific therapies, assessing frailty might improve the accuracy of those available cancer prognostic tools that might underperform in frail older adults.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using version 8.3.9.2 of SEER*Stat software to extract data from the SEER 17 Plus database. Patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioblastoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2019 were included to calculate overall survival (OS), relative survival (RS), and conditional survival. R software was used to calculate univariate and multivariate Cox regression models for age, sex, and race to identify their effect on survival. We included 45,071 patients with grade IV glioblastoma according to WHO 2016 classification. The observed 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates showed a decline to 40.1%, 9.8%, and 5.2%, respectively. Similarly, the relative 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 40.7%, 10.2%, and 5.4%, respectively. The conditional 3-year survival rates improved up to 16.9%, 42.9%, and 60.2% after 1, 3, and 5 years of survival, correspondingly, with females showing better estimates. The most common cancer CODs were the brain and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers. Among non-glioblastoma cancer CODs, breast cancer was the most common cause. Additionally, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and septicemia were the most common non-cancer CODs. In this study, patients with glioblastoma showed a sharp decline in OS and RS over time after diagnosis. However, there was a notable improvement in conditional 3-year survival over time. Cardiovascular diseases emerged as the most common non-cancer COD, with lower survival rates in males and advanced age.",

  "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of pathologic overactivation of the immune system that leads to excessive inflammation and tissue destruction. It can be genetic or acquired in the setting of infection, autoimmune disorders, or malignancy. Here we present a case report of a patient who was initially thought to have severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but was ultimately diagnosed with HLH per the 2004 criteria, most likely secondary to   infection. A 69-year-old female presented with cough, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings were significant for coagulopathy initially thought to be DIC, but she was subsequently diagnosed with HLH. Bone marrow biopsy showed increased histiocytes showing hemophagocytosis. The trigger for the HLH was initially unclear, but the patient was eventually found to meet Q fever criteria after being found to be positive for  . She underwent treatment with the HLH-94 protocol, which includes high-dose steroids and etoposide with normalization of hematologic labs and resolution of symptoms. She was also treated with a standard course of doxycycline for  . HLH should be considered in patients who present with DIC-like labs and other hematologic abnormalities. In such cases, using the H score can assist in raising suspicion for reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. A biopsy of the involved site, such as bone marrow, showing increased hemophagocytosis can also help with confirming the diagnosis. It is important for early identification and initiation of treatment for HLH to improve survival outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS) is a benign yet locally aggressive proliferative lesion arising from the synovium of tendon sheaths, bursae, or joints. It most commonly affects the hands and feet, with toe involvement being particularly rare. We present a case of a 41-year-old male with a painful, firm mass on the big toe, initially suspected to be gout. Imaging studies, which included an MRI, revealed a well-defined soft tissue mass with marked cortical erosion of the first metatarsal, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of GCT-TS. The patient underwent marginal excision of the lesion, with no recurrence at follow-up. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with GCT-TS in uncommon locations and highlights the utilization of MRI in assessing tumor extent and guiding preoperative planning. Despite its benign nature, the risk of recurrence necessitates complete excision and careful postoperative monitoring. The emergence of molecular therapies, such as CSF1R inhibitors, shows promise for recurrent or inoperable cases. Early recognition, precise surgical intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach in tackling this tumor are crucial for optimizing outcomes and preventing recurrence in atypical presentations of GCT-TS.",

  "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare but serious complication that poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article presents three cases of leptomeningeal involvement in patients with MM, highlighting the diverse clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies employed. The first case is a 54-year-old female who, after initial treatment and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, developed CNS disease. Similarly, a 73-year-old female developed leptomeningeal involvement with progressive neurological symptoms. The third case describes a 63-year-old female with immunoglobulin (Ig)A lambda MM who developed CNS disease after treatment with daratumumab and radiation. In all three cases, leptomeningeal enhancement and atypical plasma cells were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with treatment strategies including intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiation, and stem cell transplantation. Despite aggressive management, including novel agents and supportive care, all patients had poor outcomes, with two transitioning to hospice care. The article reviews the limited literature on CNS-MM, noting the lack of standardized treatment protocols and the need for further research. As the survival of MM patients improves, the incidence of CNS involvement is expected to rise, making the development of targeted therapies essential. These cases underscore the urgent need for further investigation into novel treatment options and the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management of CNS-MM.",

  "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CCMP) is one of the well-defined toxicities associated with chemotherapy use that can lead to serious side effects. An example of a chemotherapeutic drug class that has been well documented over the years to cause CCMP is anthracyclines. To date, few studies have been carried out in Saudi Arabia on the prevalence of CCMP and the associated risk factors. Therefore, the objective of our research is to measure the prevalence and determine the risk factors of such phenomena. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. Data from 114 patients was retrieved from the medical records of the cardiac department at Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City. The research included pediatric oncology patients aged 14 or under who were treated with anthracyclines from June 2016 to May 2024. We excluded patients who did not undergo ECHO. A consecutive sampling technique was used to collect the patients. Over the eight-year study period, we found that 7.34% (8/109) of the cohort developed CCMP, with a mean age at diagnosis of 6.39 ± 3.81 years. The mean dose of anthracycline received until the diagnosis of CCMP was 194.77±145.92 mg, with a median interval between anthracycline initiation and CCMP diagnosis of 13.65 (3-89) weeks. A significant association was found between thromboembolism, PDA, type of cancer, and the development of CCMP. We found that traditional predictors such as gender, age at diagnosis, and cumulative anthracycline dose were not predictors of CCMP.",

  "abstract": "digestive cancers (DC) are a group of cancers affecting the gastrointestinal tract and are capable of triggering an immune response. The cells produced during this response are tumor effectors whose role is to rid the body of tumor cells. The functional role of these cells, particularly the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in the prognosis of patients remains poorly understood in Cameroon. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of lymphocyte infiltration on the survival of patients with certain digestive cancers. we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Oncology Department and the Anatomo-Cytopathology Laboratory of the Yaoundé General Hospital (YGH). Patients histologically diagnosed with colorectal and gastric cancers with available data from YGH between 2019 and 2023, who consented to participate and had a biopsy sample available at the YGH laboratory, were included in the study. Initially, we described patients' sociodemographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics. Then, we estimated the grade of lymphocyte infiltration in colorectal and gastric cancers using Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and analyzed the correlation between lymphocyte infiltration and patient survival through Cox regression. Data were analyzed with a significance level set at 5% for all comparisons. the study enrolled 90 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 with gastric cancer. Overall survival was 64.8% at 49 months in the study population, with the median not reached for colorectal cancer, and 64% at 39 months for gastric cancer, also with a median not reached. The average age at diagnosis for colorectal and gastric cancers was 54 ± 14.53 years and 53.24 ± 11.41 years, respectively. Men predominated in both pathologies, with a sex ratio of approximately 1.11. Colonic location was predominant (53%; 46/90) for colorectal cancer, with stage III disease being most common, while the antropyloric location (46%; 23/50) was predominant for gastric cancer, with stage IV being most frequent according to the AJCC. Moreover, 86% of patients had TILs in their histological samples, with a predominance of high TILs in both colorectal (38%; 34/90) and gastric (42%; 21/50) cancers. The performance of chemotherapy was inversely proportional to TILs in colorectal cancer, while no significant difference was found between TILs and chemotherapy in gastric cancer. However, no association was found between TILs and patient survival in either colorectal or gastric cancers. Patients who had metastases had a risk of death of 14.07 (aHR: 14.07, 95% CI 1.66-119.24; p = 0.015) compared with those who did not. Similarly, patients who had not taken chemotherapy had a 21.32 greater risk of death (aHR: 21.32, 95% CI 5.35-84.96; p<0.001) than those who had. there was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients suffering from colorectal and gastric cancers, and the grade of lymphocyte infiltration. Survival was significantly impacted by the presence of metastasis and the absence of treatment.",

The BCN is a core multidisciplinary member of the breast cancer team. The evaluation of care models is necessary to detect gaps and improve the quality of care.   This cross-sectional descriptive study took place in a breast pathology unit and included patients with early breast cancer seen between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017 after finishing their treatment. Between July and December 2018, sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected from the clinical history, and satisfaction was measured using a questionnaire sent to the patients.   Of the 139 patients included, 99.3% reported that the BCN provided information correctly, 96.2% reported that she provided adequate information on self-care at home (96.2%), and 97.8% reported that the words of the BCN helped them feel better. However, some patients were unsure whether the BCN would have been willing to discuss alternative therapies (41%).   Patients were satisfied with the BCN, including her role in meeting information and support needs. However, some issues needed to be sufficiently addressed. Comprehensive, continuous assessment is required to understand patient needs. Training and specific studies on topics that are of interest to patients can help respond to these needs.   BCN functions are being developed in some countries. BCN results make it easier for healthcare managers to commit to this role and for nurses to develop all their competencies. BCN models must respond to international guidelines but are also determined by organizational resources. The evaluation of these models is essential and must be considered by users. Advanced practice nursing roles, including the BCN, are well established in some countries but developing in others. BCN results make it easier for healthcare managers to commit to this role and for nurses to develop all their skills. BCN models must respond to the elements determined by organizations that work to improve the quality of care for patients with breast cancer. However, they are also determined by organizational resources. The evaluation of these models is essential to correct deficiencies and improve the quality of care. An important part of the evaluation must take into account the user who receives the care, in terms of satisfaction and the form of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).",

  "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) who have not responded to gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP)-based therapy is dismal. Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy could be considered for those patients who are refractory to GP-based treatments. Our study aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of 5-FU-based chemotherapy for BTC patients who had progressed after gemcitabine-based treatment. This study analyzed patients from Seoul St. Mary's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital with advanced BTC who had previously failed treatment with GP-based chemotherapy. From June 2020 and May 2024, these patients received 5-FU-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment. The 5-FU-based systemic treatments encompassed 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX); 5-FU, leucovorin, and liposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI/FL); and 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Our investigation focused on evaluating the survival outcomes and safety profiles of each regimen within this cohort. In our analysis of 147 patients, the primary tumor sites were distributed with 56 (38.1%) having intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 51 (34.7%) with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 40 (27.2%) with gallbladder cancer. Regarding the 5-FU-based regimens, 57 patients (38.8%) were treated with FOLFOX, 56 (38.1%) with Nal-IRI/FL, and 34 (23.1%) with FOLFIRINOX. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-2.6) and 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.8-5.8), respectively. Poor performance status and higher histologic grade were associated with worse PFS and OS, while female gender and prior surgery were linked to improved OS. FOLFOX and Nal-IRI/FL demonstrated comparable efficacy, with a median OS of 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.5-7.3) for FOLFOX and 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.6-6.9) for Nal-IRI/FL, and no significant differences were observed across subgroups. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and biliary events were less frequent with FOLFOX, which also showed a lower incidence of adverse events and higher relative dose intensity than Nal-IRI/FL or FOLFIRINOX. In patients with advanced BTC who failed GP treatment, the FOLFOX regimen demonstrated comparable efficacy, and a more favorable safety profile compared to other 5-FU-based treatments. Given its favorable toxicity profile in a real-world setting, FOLFOX should be considered a standard second-line treatment option.",

  "abstract": "HIV/AIDS remains a major public health concern in Vietnam. While advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have significantly enhanced survival rates and transformed HIV into a manageable chronic condition, the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) often falls short of optimal levels. This study aims to evaluate the HRQL of HIV/AIDS outpatients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam and identify key factors impacting their well-being. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 328 PLHA receiving care at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases between March 2023 to March 2024. Data was collected using the World Health Organization Quality of Life-HIV Brief Version (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) instrument and included socio-demographic, clinical, and treatment-related variables. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize the data. Inferential statistical analyses, including independent  -test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and linear regression, were performed to evaluate the relationships between HRQL domains and participant characteristics. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The mean overall quality of life score was 14.6 ± 2.2. The highest domain scores were observed in spirituality (15.1 ± 3.5) and environment (15.1 ± 2.9), while the lowest was in the physical domain (14.1 ± 2.0). Significant determinants of overall quality of life included age, marital status, employment type, income, financial difficulties, chronic diseases, and CD4 counts (all p < 0.05). This study highlights the multifaceted challenges affecting the quality of life of PLHA, emphasizing the need for a holistic care approach. Being married, having stable employment, and having higher CD4 counts were associated with better quality of life, whereas older age, unstable income, financial struggles, and comorbidities were linked to poorer outcomes. Interventions addressing these determinants, including chronic disease management, social and mental health support are crucial for enhancing overall well-being.",

However, the mechanisms underlying primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the biomarkers associated with primary resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs was defined as disease progression within 90 days (3 months) of treatment in patients with EGFR-sensitive mutant adenocarcinoma without any evidence of objective response. Retrospective, single-center study. This study retrospectively screened patients with NSCLC who received EGFR-TKIs at Hunan Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. According to pre-determined clinical outcomes, we divided the patients into primary resistance and sensitivity groups. Only patients with sufficient samples that passed quality control were included in this study. Tumor tissue and paired peripheral blood samples collected from patients before treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing using an 825-gene panel. In addition, tumor tissue samples were analyzed for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this study, with 35 in each of the primary resistant and sensitive groups. Patients with exon 4 mutations in the   gene had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those without the mutation.   and   mutation frequencies were substantially higher in the primary resistant group and were associated with shorter PFS and OS. Furthermore, patients in the primary resistant group exhibited substantially higher levels of PD-L1 expression. The potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs are highly heterogeneous. Combining some somatic variants affecting tumor function and high PD-L1 expression may contribute to this resistance.",

Despite their high frequency, there is still no consensus about treatment options. All PFCL grades can be treated with surgery, nonoperative treatment, or both. The purpose of this study was to compare patients with PFCLs who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy surgery followed by physical therapy and rehabilitation with those patients who only received physical therapy and rehabilitation. It was hypothesized that patients who underwent unilateral Fulkerson osteotomy surgery would have superior results compared with patients who only received nonoperative treatment. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. This was a prospective study with a case-control design and included 20 patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy and 20 patients with PFCL who were managed nonoperatively. The follow-up period was a median of 13.25 months (range, 12.03-14.71 months) for patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy and 12.85 months (range, 12-14.37 months) for patients who were treated nonoperatively. Knee joint position sense and gait kinematics were assessed using the DrGoniometer Application and Zebris FDM-T device. The functional level was determined using the single-leg hop test, the single-leg squat test, and the Kujala subjective knee evaluation form. When comparing gait kinematics of the affected sides between patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy and those who received nonoperative treatment (physical therapy and rehabilitation only), differences were observed in step length, cadence, stance phase percentage, and swing phase percentage (  < .05). In knee joint position sense of the affected sides at 60° target angle, patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy had significant improvements after surgery (  < .05), whereas patients who were managed nonoperatively showed continued impairment both before and after treatment (  < .05). No significant differences were observed in single-leg hop and single-leg squat test results between the 2 groups (  > .05). Kujala scores were significantly higher in the Fulkerson osteotomy group (89.79 ± 12.67 vs 80.10 ± 13.20, respectively) (  < .05). Patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy had superior gait kinematics, joint position sense at 60° of flexion, and Kujala scores. No significant changes were observed in terms of the joint position sense at 15°, 45°, and 90° of flexion, the single-leg hop test, and the single-leg squat test compared with those who received nonoperative treatment.",

Five postmenopausal women were treated with estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) which included TDE  and progestin formulation for MHT. The progestin formulation was replaced with BZA, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, due to unscheduled uterine bleeding. Four of five postmenopausal women were evaluated in terms of estrogen dynamics and recurrence of climacteric symptoms. In all cases examined in this report, unscheduled uterine bleeding resolved within one month. In two of four patients in whom climacteric symptoms recurred, their serum estradiol levels were surprisingly elevated three months after the start of TDE /BZA. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the successful treatment of unscheduled uterine bleeding by TDE /BZA during MHT and a suggested correlation between estrogen dynamics and concomitant recurrence of side effects caused by TDE /BZA.",

We describe a case of HCQ-induced hepatic failure in a 31-year-old female patient on HCQ for systemic lupus erythematous who presented with three days of fever, diarrhea, and non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. Labs showed massively elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and negative viral serology. The abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were unremarkable. A liver biopsy showed portal tracts with mild to moderate expansion by mixed inflammatory infiltrates, including scattered eosinophils and rare plasma cells with occasional mild interface activity focally close to bridging inflammation.

Overall, 112 patients were included, with 84 receiving RT and 28 FT as primary treatment. Median age and PSA were 68 years and 5.4 ng/mL, respectively. There was one rectal injury in the RT group. The overall 90-day complications were significantly higher in RT group (33% vs. 11%,   = 0.03). On multivariable analysis, history of RT and prolonged operative time were associated with a higher rate of 90-day complications. The 6- and 12-month continence rates were higher in FT group (50% vs. 20%,   = 0.02 and 69% vs. 33%,   = 0.03). Potency at 12 months was better preserved in FT group (46% vs. 12%,   = 0.01). On final sRRP pathology, the rates of grade group ≥ 4 (51% vs. 36%,   = 0.2), pT3 (69% vs. 75%,   = 0.6), positive nodes (30% vs. 18%,   = 0.2) and positive margins (33% vs. 39%,   = 0.5) were similar for RT versus FT, respectively. The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 86% for RT versus 94% for FT (  = 0.6).  sRRP for recurrent PCa after FT is associated with lower complications and higher urinary continence and potency rates than patients who received primary RT.",

  "abstract": "Introduction Elbow stiffness can be disabling when performing activities. Surgery is indicated when conservative treatment fails. In older patients, the most appropriate surgical option is total elbow arthroplasty. However, in younger patients, the choice of surgery remains a topic of discussion. Materials and methods This study was a retrospective case series with a five-year follow-up, evaluating the outcomes of interpositional arthroplasty with dermal grafting and a hinged external fixator for elbow osteoarthrosis associated with stiffness in young adults according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the quickDASH score, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and range of motion (ROM). Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. Imaging evaluations were performed preoperatively and at the 60-month follow-up. All complications were documented. Results We evaluated 40 patients. The MEPS increased from 42.6 ± 12.2 to 70.3 ± 18.6 (p < 0.001). The quickDASH score decreased from 43.4 ± 3.2 to 25.3 ± 9.7 (p < 0.001), and the VAS score decreased from 8.7 ± 2.0 to 3.7 ± 2.7 at the end of follow-up (p < 0.001). The flexion-extension arc increased from 49˚ ± 27˚ to 92˚ ± 29˚ (p < 0.001). Imaging studies showed a reduction in joint narrowing, a decrease in osteophytes, a higher radiographic classification of arthrosis, and fewer loose bodies. A total of 65% of patients experienced transient complications, while 5% had complications requiring reoperation, including arthrodesis and total elbow arthroplasty. Conclusions Interpositional arthroplasty with dermal grafting and a hinged external fixator for elbow osteoarthrosis associated with stiffness in young adults significantly improves clinical functional scale scores, ROM, and radiological appearance at the five-year follow-up. Despite the high rate of complications, most were transient and manageable, with only a small percentage of cases (5%) requiring surgical reintervention. The procedure demonstrated sustained functional benefits over time, with early improvements in pain and mobility stabilizing in the long term.",

  "abstract": "The traditional classification and risk stratification systems of endometrial cancer (EC), which relied on histomorphological features, were limited and poor reproducible. The classification of new molecular subtypes of EC has been developing, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-four molecular subtypes: Polymerase epsilon (POLE) mutation (POLEmut), microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy number-low, and copy number-high and ProMisE-four molecular subtypes: POLEmut, mismatch repair deficiency, no specific molecular profile, and p53 abnormal. POLEmut usually correlates with a favorable outcome. Hence, we reviewed the research since the TCGA molecular subtypes developed in 2013 and summarized the characteristics and prognosis of POLEmut EC patients. In summary, we found POLEmut occurs in 7.3%-9.6% of EC in the previous studies. POLEmut EC consistently exhibits favorable patient outcomes, regardless of adjuvant therapy. The research of POLEmut in EC is absent in Taiwan, and the underlying mechanisms and cost-effectiveness need further investigation.",

  "abstract": "Digital ulcers (DUs) are a major cause of pain and disability in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and remain a major treatment challenge. Our aim was to explore clinicians' perspectives towards treatment initiation and escalation, akin to a 'Treat to Target' (T2T) strategy. SSc clinicians were invited to participate in an online survey. A total of 173 responses (75% rheumatologists) were obtained from 33 countries. When initiating a change in oral drug therapy for SSc-DUs, most (80%) respondents would consider adding new medication to existing treatment, and 50% would increase existing treatment dose. Time to assess the impact of treatment change varied considerably, with around half (43.6%) waiting 1 month. Endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors and prostanoids were considered most efficacious for DU prevention, with good perceived efficacy from calcium channel blockers and moderate benefit from anti-platelet agents and immunosuppression. Side effects (e.g. headache and peripheral oedema) are perceived to be a significant issue with oral vasodilatory/vasoactive therapies in many patients. The highest rated T2T targets were (1) complete absence of new/recurrent DUs (63%), (2) reduction >50% in the number of DU recurrence (52%) and (3) reduction in DU healing time (37%) and reduction in DU pain >50% (37%). The most frequent reasons for hospitalisation were to administer intravenous treatment (91%) and DU complications (87%). Surgery is reserved for the threatened digit (e.g. gangrene), underlying calcinosis and failure of medical therapy. Significant heterogeneity currently exists concerning treatment initiation and escalation for SSc-DUs, potentially amenable to a T2T strategy.",

  "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare but serious complication that poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article presents three cases of leptomeningeal involvement in patients with MM, highlighting the diverse clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies employed. The first case is a 54-year-old female who, after initial treatment and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, developed CNS disease. Similarly, a 73-year-old female developed leptomeningeal involvement with progressive neurological symptoms. The third case describes a 63-year-old female with immunoglobulin (Ig)A lambda MM who developed CNS disease after treatment with daratumumab and radiation. In all three cases, leptomeningeal enhancement and atypical plasma cells were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with treatment strategies including intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiation, and stem cell transplantation. Despite aggressive management, including novel agents and supportive care, all patients had poor outcomes, with two transitioning to hospice care. The article reviews the limited literature on CNS-MM, noting the lack of standardized treatment protocols and the need for further research. As the survival of MM patients improves, the incidence of CNS involvement is expected to rise, making the development of targeted therapies essential. These cases underscore the urgent need for further investigation into novel treatment options and the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management of CNS-MM.",

  "abstract": "Paralysis of the serratus anterior (SA) is most frequently caused by dysfunction of the long thoracic nerve (LTN). Although this condition presents with classic physical examination findings, it is occasionally missed. The purpose of this study is to review the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for SA palsy. This study summarizes the anatomy of the SA and LTN, most common causes of SA palsy, physical examination findings, utility of diagnostic tests, the natural history of this condition, and all treatment options that can be contemplated. SA palsy should be suspected in patients with weak forward flexion and abnormal prominence of the medial edge of the scapula with weakness in shoulder protraction. The diagnosis can be confirmed with electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Magnetic resonance may show neurogenic fatty infiltration or atrophy. Although most patients benefit from conservative treatment (mostly physical therapy) for the first 12 months, many patients experience persistent weakness with various degrees of severity. For patients with disabling symptoms, nerve release or transfers have been reported to lead to SA reinnervation with functional improvements. However, long-standing palsy is best managed with a split pectoralis major transfer of the sternal head to the inferior pole of the scapula. Scapulothoracic arthrodesis is an uncommon procedure for patients in whom a previous tendon transfer has failed. LTN dysfunction leading to SA palsy can be typically diagnosed with certain physical examination findings and confirmed using electromyogram with nerve conduction studies. Although spontaneous recovery can occur, patients with persistent serratus weakness may be considered for neurolysis, nerve transfer, or tendon transfer. Currently, direct transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major to the inferior pole of the scapula is our management of choice for patients with disabling symptoms and no improvement despite a good program of physical therapy.",

Cordocentesis revealed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low levels of free thyroxine 4 (fT4), which was the basis of diagnosis of fetal hypothyroidism. Intra-amniotic injections of levothyroxine were administered, resulting in a reduction in the goiter size, amount of amniotic fluid, and level of maternal TSH. The mother was euthyroid during pregnancy. The infant was delivered vaginally at full term with a normal thyroid size and no respiratory disorders except hypothyroidism.

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pancytopenia is an exceedingly rare adverse effect of antithyroid medications. It can be associated with both propylthiouracil and methimazole. While agranulocytosis is a more common adverse effect, pancytopenia has unique diagnostic and management issues due to its potential severity. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with pancytopenia 2 months after starting methimazole for Grave's disease. Her case was complicated by severe candidemia and Serratia bacteremia. Laboratory workup revealed positive cytoplasmic and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) on immunofluorescence testing, with negative results on ELISA for MPO and PR3 antibodies. These findings were attributed to methimazole-induced ANCA positivity rather than primary ANCA-associated vasculitis. Methimazole was discontinued, and the patient was managed with aggressive antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, including blood transfusions and antifungal treatment. Despite the complexity of her condition, she survived after several months of intensive care and showed gradual improvement in blood counts and overall clinical status. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the importance of recognizing potential iatrogenic causes of pancytopenia in patients receiving antithyroid medications. Early identification, prompt discontinuation of the offending agent, and comprehensive supportive care are essential for positive outcomes. This case also highlights the necessity for vigilant monitoring, patient education, and regular follow-up in individuals on antithyroid medications to prevent severe complications, morbidity, and mortality associated with rare but serious adverse effects like pancytopenia.",

An example of a chemotherapeutic drug class that has been well documented over the years to cause CCMP is anthracyclines. To date, few studies have been carried out in Saudi Arabia on the prevalence of CCMP and the associated risk factors. Therefore, the objective of our research is to measure the prevalence and determine the risk factors of such phenomena. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. Data from 114 patients was retrieved from the medical records of the cardiac department at Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City. The research included pediatric oncology patients aged 14 or under who were treated with anthracyclines from June 2016 to May 2024. We excluded patients who did not undergo ECHO. A consecutive sampling technique was used to collect the patients. Over the eight-year study period, we found that 7.34% (8/109) of the cohort developed CCMP, with a mean age at diagnosis of 6.39 ± 3.81 years. The mean dose of anthracycline received until the diagnosis of CCMP was 194.77±145.92 mg, with a median interval between anthracycline initiation and CCMP diagnosis of 13.65 (3-89) weeks. A significant association was found between thromboembolism, PDA, type of cancer, and the development of CCMP. We found that traditional predictors such as gender, age at diagnosis, and cumulative anthracycline dose were not predictors of CCMP.",

  "abstract": "Geriatric pelvic and acetabular fractures pose significant challenges due to patient frailty, comorbidities, and the complexity of fracture patterns. This review examines current evidence and evolving strategies for managing these injuries. Treatment approaches range from nonoperative management to surgical interventions, including percutaneous fixation, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and total hip arthroplasty, either as a standalone procedure or combined with ORIF. Decision making is guided by fracture morphology, patient functionality, and physiological reserve to optimize clinical outcomes. Minimally invasive techniques, particularly for fragility fractures of the pelvis, have gained traction because of their ability to provide stable fixation while minimizing surgical morbidity. The importance of early mobilization and a multidisciplinary perioperative approach is highlighted as essential in reducing complications and improving recovery. Despite advancements, controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment of complex acetabular fractures in elderly patients. This review synthesizes the latest evidence and expert perspectives to aid clinicians in selecting the most appropriate management strategies, with the goal of restoring mobility, minimizing complications, and enhancing the quality of life in this vulnerable population.",

  "abstract": "cancer ranks as the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, manifesting in diverse forms and impacting various tissues, notably prostate cancer (PCa) in men and breast cancer (BCa) in women. Cancer is a malignant tumor that can induce an immune response. During this reaction, immune cells are produced which are responsible for ridding the body of senescent and/or tumor cells, and constitute tumor effectors. Studies have shown that the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a good prognostic marker for assessing survival in cancer patients; however, no similar data have yet been published in Cameroon. the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between TILs and the survival of breast and prostate cancer patients at Yaoundé General Hospital (YGH) between 2019 and 2023. For this, a retrospective and cross-sectional study was undertaken at the Oncology Department and the Anatomo-Cytopathology Laboratory of YGH. A consecutive non-probability sampling (from August to October 2023) of 212 breast cancer patients and 89 prostate cancer patients who agreed to participate in the study constituted our sample. Variables were survival, TILs, sociodemographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics of patients. The TILs were estimated after Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and staged as low, middle and high TILs rate. The variables were sociodemographic characteristics (age, education level, religion, marital status, ethnolinguistic area, and menopause); clinical characteristics (affected breast, histological type, histological grade, type of treatment, AJCC stage, consistency of discovery); different grades of TILs. Furthermore, the correlation between TILs and chemotherapy as well as TILs and survival were analyzed. The obtained data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, Epi-info 7 and SPSS software and statistical significance was considered at p< 0.05. Furthermore, the Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with survival was performed. the mean age was 43.56 ± 11.90 years for BCa with stage II and SBR grade II being the most common with proportions of 48.34% and 54.72%, respectively (n= 212). While in PCa, the mean age was 75 to 84 years (34.83%, n= 89) with stage II being the most frequent. Microscopic analysis of breast tissues revealed four TILs grades: absent (17.45%), low (18.40%), intermediate (27.83%) and high TIL grade (36.32%), while in PCa the most represented TILs grade was intermediate (31.46%). In BCa the intermediate TILs grade was positively associated with a good response to chemotherapy (p< 0.05). The overall 5-year survival in this study was around 44% for BCa, whereas it was 42 months for those with infiltration in PCa. No positive correlation was found between TILs grade and survival in BCa patients (p= 0.45), while in PCa, it was found that TILs are significantly correlated (p =0.016) with survival. Patients with prostate cancer who had not taken treatment had a 7.23 greater risk of death (HR: 7.23, 95% CI 1.21-53.14; p= 0.049) than those who had. no positive association was observed between TILs as graded and 5-year survival in BCa patients; however, it may have prognostic value in PCa patients. Further studies are encouraged to investigate the association between BCa molecular groups and TILs.",

These topics include staged treatment strategies, surgical planning, fracture classification, and factors influencing weight bearing. A staged protocol for treating high-energy fractures of the proximal tibia using spanning external fixation with quadrangular configuration is a simple and reproducible way to apply the device and reduce and span these fractures. Multicolumnar fractures can behave differently based on their categorization using the main deformity direction concept, defined as a theoretical vector representing the global displacement or deformity of the columns in a specific direction, and this can help surgeons decide on the definitive treatment. With the classification of columnar involvement and their variants, surgeons can use computed tomography scans to formulate solutions to approach and fix individual fracture patterns. Finally, a finite element analysis may inform the surgeon's decision for immediate weight bearing of a split plateau fracture after fixation with locking screw plates or cannulated screws.",

  "abstract": "Fetal bladder rupture is rare and mainly caused by lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO). Our case report describes a rupture at a gestational age of 31 weeks following high-dose maternal opioid exposure during intensive care treatment. Opioids perturb the interplay of afferent and efferent signals between the bladder, urethra, and the central nervous system (CNS) which is crucial in contributing to urinary retention. They rapidly cross the human placenta, affecting also the fetus. To date, there is no clear proof of the connection between maternal opioid treatment and fetal bladder rupture, but the association seems to strengthen. A 18-year old first Gravida at 31 weeks of gestation developed a severe sepsis with progressive hypoxic lung failure and need for intubation. During the ICU-treatment, several opioids were administered for sedation and pain relief. Four days after induction of opioid treatment the ultrasound revealed a decompressed fetal bladder, hematoma and significant ascites. Fetal bladder rupture with urinary ascites was suspected. A caesarean section was performed at 33 weeks of gestation due to massive fetal urinary ascites, fetal deterioration and imminent abdominal compartment syndrome. Adequate ventilation and circulation could only be established after percutaneous drainage of 350 mL of abdominal fluid, that was confirmed to be urine. A defect of the bladder was confirmed by ultrasound. On the fifth day of life, the bladder was closed surgically by pediatric surgery. Growing awareness of the possible connection between maternal opioid therapy and fetal bladder rupture is necessary to plan follow-up ultrasound examinations to assess the fetal situation.",

Monitoring of serum drug and anti-drug antibody levels is essential for managing patients with treatment failure. A Reporter Gene Assay (RGA), previously developed for infliximab, was validated for the measurement of biosimilars infliximab-dyyb and infliximab-abda, and detection of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA). 65 de-identified residual samples from patients receiving infliximab or its biosimilars, were tested. ELISA and cell-based Reporter Gene Assay (RGA) were performed to measure drug while a bridging ELISA and a modified RGA assay were performed to detect ADA. Analysis of assay analytical parameters showed acceptable linearity (systematic error < 15 %), recovery (82-119 %), precision and reproducibility (coefficient of variation < 15 %) of the RGA assay for measuring biosimilars. Detection of ADA developed against infliximab or biosimilars showed a complete agreement (Cohen's k = 1; 95 % CI = 1.0 to 1.0) between the RGA assays using infliximab, versus infliximab-dyyb, or infliximab-abda as assay reagents. A functional cell-based reporter gene assay was validated for measuring serum concentrations of infliximab biosimilars and neutralizing antibodies. This study supports the bio- equivalency and cross-immunogenicity of parent drug and biosimilars and offers guidance for management of patients switching therapies between parent drug and biosimilars.",

  "abstract": "Study DesignModified Delphi study.ObjectivesTelementoring, the practice of providing remote guidance and teaching from a distance using telecommunication technology, has demonstrated feasibility and value in assisting surgeons in remote locations. However, limited evidence exists regarding its effectiveness in improving surgeon performance. This study aimed to develop metrics to assess spine surgeon performance in scoliosis surgery, potentially within the context of a telementoring training program.MethodsTen expert spine surgeons participated in a four-round modified Delphi process including both online and in-person meetings. The resulting metrics were validated for objective assessment by eleven surgeons, who reviewed and rated a video recording using the established rubric.ResultsThe final set of metrics, comprising 50 procedural steps and 28 error categories, was unanimously approved by the panel. Additionally, the panel agreed that utilizing cameras, smart lenses, and output from intraoperative imaging monitors would provide sufficient visibility for assessing both steps and errors.ConclusionsA set of assessment metrics for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery was successfully defined and validated by reviewing example videos. The longer-term research objective is to employ this rubric to assess surgeon's performance throughout a telementoring program, thus assessing its educational impact. The rubric could also be used in other contexts, such as live surgical observation.",

  "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious systemic inflammatory condition triggered by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, that can result in multiple organ failure and a life-threatening situation. Despite advances in medical care, the mortality rate for sepsis remains high even with aggressive treatment strategies such as antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and respiratory and circulatory support. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as a novel nanoscale biocarrier, exhibit diverse biological functions including immune modulation and tissue regeneration, suggesting promising applications in the field. This article provides an overview of the diverse therapeutic effects of EVs derived from various sources in the management of sepsis. Furthermore, EVs not only possess intrinsic therapeutic properties, such as immune modulation, but also function as targeted delivery vehicles for a variety of drug molecules, leading to synergistic therapeutic outcomes. In conclusion, extracellular vesicle therapy is poised to emerge as a dynamic and innovative force driving advancements in sepsis treatment.",

This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome in SLE and evaluate the therapeutic potential of specific microbial supplementation in MRL/lpr mice. MRL/lpr mice, a well-established model for SLE, were used to analyze gut microbiome changes before and after SLE symptom onset. 16S rRNA sequencing and GC-MS-based metabolic profiling were performed to identify key microbial species and associated metabolites. Selected microbes were supplemented in MRL/lpr mice for 10 weeks, and their effects on SLE symptoms and Th17/Treg balance were evaluated. Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Lacrimispora saccharolytica, and Hungatella xylanolytica were significantly decreased in MRL/lpr mice following the onset of SLE symptoms. These microbes were strongly correlated with specific metabolites, including 5-cholestanol, cholesterol, p-cresol, and indole. Supplementation with these microbes alleviated SLE symptoms and modulated the Th17/Treg balance. This study highlights the critical role of gut microbiota in immune regulation and SLE symptom relief. Targeted microbial supplementation may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for managing SLE.",

Since repeated mobilization is known to be valuable in non-surgical OI conditions, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an early standardized repeated mobilization procedure as treatment of postoperative OI after THA. This study was a single-arm, two-center hypothesis-generating feasibility study in patients undergoing THA. At first mobilization 4 h after surgery patients were categorized as having orthostatic tolerance (OT) or OI. Patients with OI underwent an hourly standardized repeated mobilization procedure until achieving OT or reaching 8 h post-surgery. Of 84 patients screened for OI, 25 (30 %) had OI 4 h postoperatively. Four patients left the study before achieving OT. Of the 21 completing the study per protocol, 16 patients achieved OT at 5 h and the remaining 5 achieved OT at 6 h postoperatively.

  "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of relative change in E2 levels during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) on embryo development and pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART). We retrospectively analyzed 9,376 patients who underwent their first fresh ART cycle from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. Patients were classified into four groups based on relative change in E2 levels: low response group, moderate response group, moderate-high response group, and high response group. The primary outcomes were blastocyst formation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and live birth rate, while secondary outcomes included miscarriage rate and ectopic pregnancy rate. Most cycles (96.5%) demonstrated an increase in E2 levels during COS. The blastocyst formation rate significantly increased across the groups (low response group: 0.13, moderate response group: 0.21, moderate-high response group: 0.28, high response group: 0.34; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression showed significantly higher blastocyst formation rates in the moderate response group (adjusted OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.687-2.399), moderate-high response group (adjusted OR = 4.613, 95% CI: 3.853-5.523), and high response group (adjusted OR = 11.295, 95% CI: 9.192-13.880) compared to the low response group.

  "abstract": "Multiple rare diagnoses in the neuroinflammatory disease spectrum are associated with a high morbidity and mortality and are refractory to systemic immunotherapies. Owing to disease rarity, there are often barriers or delays in introducing novel treatment protocols. The development of institutional treatment protocols helps to ensure consistent and improved efficiency to help ensure optimal patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary team with aligned interests was created and aided in identifying the need for a new treatment regimen for patients with treatment refractory neuroinflammatory disease. This work group was convened to determine a standardized template for the management of patients requiring intrathecal therapy. After review and assessment of existing clinical case reports, and other supporting documents, the workgroup reached a consensus regarding optimal treatment approaches, created methods for distribution, and education of providers to utilize the developed clinical template. We document our process for creating and implementing a treatment protocol for intrathecal (IT) dexamethasone in children with treatment-refractory neuroinflammatory disease. The treatment protocol was approved by key stakeholders across multiple disciplines as part of a collaborative effort to improve outcomes. We describe eight patients with neuroinflammatory disease treated with IT dexamethasone without adverse events. There are many barriers in the introduction of novel treatment protocols in rare disease. Utilization of a multidisciplinary team can help identify barriers and facilitate protocol development, leading to alternative treatment pathways in those with rare disease. The development of a standardized treatment approach can be an important way to ensure adequate and effective treatment of patients with rare disorders. The implementation process requires institutions to dedicate resources to ensure key stakeholder input to address barriers to implementation, and to provide ongoing input following implementation to assess patient outcomes.",

The cumulative incidence of CS-HCMV-i at 100 and 180 days from transplant was 3.8% and 16%, respectively, in patients who received LET-PP, and 14% and 17% in patients who did not. Variables associated with increased risk of CS-HCMV-i in patients who received LET-PP included transplant from an HCMV-seronegative donor, transplant from a donor other than matched related, >20 days to engraftment, and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transplant in HCMV-seropositive recipients was associated with increased risk of CS-HCMV-i in patients who did not receive LET-PP. One-year overall survival after transplant was 81.1%. Acute leukemia, disease not in remission at transplant, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >1, >20 days to engraftment, acute GVHD, CS Epstein-Barr virus DNAemia, gram-negative bacteremia, and invasive fungal disease were associated with increased mortality in patients who received LET-PP.

  "abstract": "Good sleep quality is crucial for health and body equilibrium, particularly during pregnancy, where changes in sleep are influenced by mechanical and hormonal factors. Poor sleep can hinder daily activities and lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data on sleep quality are scarce in low and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to determine the magnitude of sleep quality and its associated factors among pregnant mothers in Bahir Dar City, northwest Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 367 randomly selected pregnant women. All pregnant women who attended public health facilities in Bahir Dar City from November 1st to December 30, 2022 were included except who were critically ill and aged less than 18 years. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Sleep quality was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Stata v14 was used for data analysis. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with poor sleep quality. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.04%. In the multivariable analysis, older maternal age (AOR = 3.62), third trimester (AOR = 2.83), multigravidas (AOR = 2.55), low hemoglobin (AOR = 1.92), and coffee consumption (AOR = 2.19) were associated with poor sleep quality. More than half of pregnant women had poor sleep quality. Women aged ≥ 30 years, 3rd trimester, multigravidas, anemic women, and coffee consumption during pregnancy were factors associated with poor sleep quality. The concerned body should pay attention to improving Hgb level and iron/folate supplementation and reduce coffee intake in pregnant women to improve maternal sleep quality during pregnancy.",

  "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRDs) are a group of diseases responsible for inflammatory joint pains and can affect young women with a desire to conceive. CIRDs can impact female fertility, although the exact effects are still not fully understood. Some studies report reduced fertility, particularly due to prolonged conception delays, which are related to multiple factors. Among these, sexual dysfunction is common due to pain and chronic fatigue. The impact of CIRDs on ovarian reserve remains controversial. Regarding treatments, disease-modifying drugs have not shown a deleterious effect on fertility, but certain teratogenic treatments should be avoided in women who wish to conceive. Furthermore, there appears to be an association between CIRDs and some gynecological conditions known causes of infertility. For patients with CIRDs, early discussion about fertility is necessary. In the case of a desire for pregnancy, preconception consultation is essential to adjust treatments, manage risks, and prepare for pregnancy under the best possible conditions. In cases of proven infertility, assisted reproductive technology is a therapeutic option. Some studies suggest that success rates may be lower than those observed in the general population. A multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, gynecologists, and reproductive specialists, as well as therapeutic optimization during the preconception period, is crucial to improve the chances of conception and provide appropriate follow-up for these patients.",

  "abstract": "Amygdala hyperreactivity early-post trauma has been a demonstrable neurobiological correlate of future posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD). The basolateral amygdala (BLA) particularly is vital for fear memory and threat processing, but BLA functional dynamics following a traumatic event are unexplored. BLA reactivity to threat may be a trait that can predict PTSD and persist over time. Alternatively, BLA responsivity to threat cues may change over time and be related to PTSD severity. As part of a larger, multisite study, AURORA, participants 18-75 years old were enrolled in an emergency department (ED) within 72 h of a traumatic event (N = 304, 199 female). At 2-weeks and 6-months post-trauma, PTSD symptoms, BLA responses to threat (fearful>neutral faces), and functional connectivity (FC) during fMRI were assessed. Generalizability of findings was assessed in an external replication sample of ED patients (n = 33). Two weeks post-trauma right BLA reactivity positively predicted later PTSD severity. However, left BLA reactivity to threat at 6 months post-trauma was negatively associated with PTSD severity at that timepoint (ΔPseudo-R  = 0.04, IRR = 0.38, p < 0.001). In addition, a decrease in BLA reactivity from 2-weeks to 6-months predicted greater PTSD severity at 6 months (ΔPseudo-R  = 0.03, IRR = 0.58, p < 0.001). This replicated in the external sample. A reduction in left BLA FC with the dorsal attention network predicted increased PTSD severity over time. These findings support a shift in BLA function within the first 6 months post-trauma that predicts PTSD pathology and stand in contrast to prior conceptualizations of amygdala hyperreactivity as a trait-like PTSD risk factor.",

  "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a degenerative joint disease driven by biomechanical instability, involves cartilage degradation, muscle dysfunction, and MLK3/P38 MAPK pathway activation. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a regulator of chondrocyte and muscle homeostasis, interacts with this pathway during disease progression. While Hyriopsis Bioactive Polysaccharide-Anodonta (HBP-A) exhibits P38 MAPK inhibitory properties in vitro, its in vivo therapeutic effects on musculoskeletal tissues remain uncharacterised. A destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model was established to investigate HBP-A's therapeutic potential. Animals were randomly divided into sham-operated, DMM-induced, and HBP-A-treated groups. Following surgical induction, HBP-A (0.26 g/kg) was administered daily via oral gavage for 4 weeks. Comprehensive assessments included behavioural tests for pain sensitivity, micro-CT scanning, histological evaluation, and transmission electron microscope. Molecular mechanisms were investigated via immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining of MLK3, P38 MAPK, Caspase-3, and HDAC4, complemented by RT-qPCR analysis of myokine expression. HBP-A treatment significantly alleviated pain sensitivity compared to the DMM group. Structural evaluations revealed preserved subchondral bone integrity and attenuated cartilage degeneration, with histological scoring confirming reduced pathological changes. Quadriceps exhibited mitigated atrophy and restored ultrastructural organisation. Molecular profiling demonstrated suppressed MLK3/P38 MAPK pathway activation, diminished apoptotic activity, and elevated HDAC4 expression in both cartilage and quadriceps. HBP-A additionally normalised dysregulated expression of muscle-derived osteogenic factors linked to bone-cartilage crosstalk. These findings establish HBP-A as a dual-target therapeutic agent for KOA, concurrently mitigating cartilage and muscle degeneration through MLK3/P38 MAPK/HDAC4 axis modulation.",

  "abstract": "Worldwide, ischemic heart disease is less prevalent in women than in men, but this gap has narrowed in recent decades. This study aims to evaluate trends and gender differences in the global burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) across demographics and regions from 1990 to 2021. We utilized the data of the Global Burden of Disease Study from 1990 to 2021. The standard epidemiological measurements, including incidence, prevalence, mortality rates, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), were obtained to estimate the burden of IHD concerning age, sex, and the sociodemographic index, allowing for comparisons over time. The sex parity ratio (SPR), defined as the ratio of females to males, has increased globally. The SPR of age-standardized prevalence (ASPR) and age-standardized incidence (ASIR) rose from 0.610 to 0.631 in 1990 to 0.653 and 0.670 in 2021, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, the SPRs for ASPR and ASIR of IHD increased across all age groups. However, the SPRs for the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) of IHD declined. This decrease in the SPR for both ASMR and ASDR of IHD was observed in most regions of this study. While progress has been made in reducing the burden of IHD, the increasing sex disparities in specific regions and age groups emphasize the need for continuous monitoring, adaptive health policies, and sex-specific healthcare practices to ensure equitable health outcomes for all populations. not applicable.",
