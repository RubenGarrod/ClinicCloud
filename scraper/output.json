  "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children. This study investigates the clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, serotype distribution, and antibiotic resistance patterns in Vietnamese children aged 1-59 months with pneumococcal meningitis (PM). This retrospective study (2012-2023) was conducted at two tertiary pediatric hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City. CSF samples from probable bacterial meningitis (PBM) cases were analyzed using biochemistry, culture, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Serotyping and antibiotic-resistance genes were identified using quadriplex rt-PCR. Among 2922 PBM cases, 155 (5.3 %) were confirmed as PM. Of these, 58.7 % occurred in children under one year and 62.6 % during the rainy season. Fever (98.1 %) and vomiting (67.7 %) were the most common symptoms. Infants under 12 months frequently exhibited nonspecific signs like convulsions (48.4 %) and bulging fontanels (34.1 %), while older children displayed classic symptoms such as neck stiffness (32.4 %) and behavioral changes (26.5 %). CSF analysis revealed turbid appearance, WBC ≥ 100 cells/mm³ (85.2 %), and protein ≥ 1 g/L (60.0 %) (p < 0.05). Severe outcomes were noted in 17.4 % of PM cases, with a 3.2 % fatality rate. The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) serotypes caused 81.3 % of confirmed cases, predominantly serotypes 6 A/B (34.8 %) and 19 F (20.0 %). Among 137 isolates tested, high prevalence rates were observed for the pbp2b (68.6 %), mef(A)/erm(B) (93.4 %), and tetM (92.0 %) resistance genes. Additionally, 61.3 % of isolates showed multiple resistance genes, particularly in serotypes 6 A/B, 23 F, 9 V, and 13. Antibiotic resistance in non-PCV13 serotypes increased over time. PM in Vietnamese children presents age-specific clinical presentations and is predominantly caused by highly resistant PCV13 serotypes. The rising resistance in non-PCV13 serotypes poses a formidable challenge in managing pneumococcal infections. These findings emphasize the urgent need for PCV introduction in the national immunization program and ongoing resistance surveillance.",

  "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that can infect virtually any nucleated cell within human and other endoderm animal tissue, including male reproductive organs. Herein, we investigate the capacity of T. gondii tachyzoites to infect and proliferate within the testes and epididymis and examine the resulting impact on human spermatozoa structure and functionality. We confirmed that T. gondii tachyzoites colonise and proliferate within the testes and epididymis, altering the tissue structural homeostasis, and causing immune cell infiltration and cellular damage. In addition to demonstrating that T. gondii remains infective within the testes and epididymis, in vitro experiments demonstrated a direct interaction between T. gondii tachyzoites and human spermatozoa. This resulted in a significant proportion of headless spermatozoa. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed structural defects in spermatozoa, such as twisted tails and plasma membrane disruptions. Moreover, T. gondii tachyzoites triggered the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in spermatozoa without modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, and triggered cell death, pointing at mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential mechanism mediating spermatozoan damage. Our findings suggest that T. gondii infection can have profound implications for male fertility by directly damaging spermatozoa and altering testicular and epididymal structures. The study underscores the need for further research to elucidate the long-term impact of T. gondii on male reproductive health, particularly in the context of iatrogenic infertility. Given the widespread seroprevalence of T. gondii in the human population, our research emphasises the importance of considering parasitic infections in diagnosing and managing male infertility in the field of andrology.",

This study investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with difficult-to-treat ABPA who failed to achieve clinical remission within 6 months. Among the participants of a nationwide survey conducted in Japan in 2020, treatment-naïve patients with ABPA who satisfied Asano's criteria were enrolled in this study. Clinical remission was defined as stable disease without exacerbation for ≥ 6 months under minimal treatment (oral prednisolone: ≤ 5 mg/day and no antifungal medication). A risk prediction score for difficult-to-treat ABPA was developed and validated in an independent cohort comprising patients with ABPA from a prospective registration study in Japan. In total, 316 treatment-naïve patients with ABPA were enrolled in the study. The median time to minimal treatment status was 4.8 months in the group receiving standard treatment. The clinical remission rate at 6 months after standard treatment was 51%. Age ≤ 50 years at onset of ABPA (p = 0.04), serum A. fumigatus-specific IgE titer of ≥ 20 U /mL (p = 0.006), positive culture for Aspergillus spp. in the sputum/bronchial lavage fluid (p = 0.05), and presence of high attenuation mucus (HAM; p = 0.10) were associated with difficult-to-treat ABPA. The number of positive indicators indicated the risk of failure of standard treatment to yield clinical remission within 6 months in the derivation (n = 87, p < 0.001) and validation (n = 64, p = 0.009) cohorts. Multiple components, including age at onset, allergic sensitization, airway fungal burden, and HAM, were associated with difficult-to-treat ABPA.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the performance of two laboratory-developed assays (LDAs) and three commercially available real-time PCR assays for the detection of Candida auris. The analytical sensitivity, specificity and limit of detection (LOD) of each assay were assessed, alongside their clinical sensitivity in identifying C. auris colonisation. Ten C. auris strains representing five clades, as well as genetically related yeasts, common yeast species, and dermatophytes, were used to assess assay sensitivity and cross reactivity. Clinical and environmental samples were collected from patients during an outbreak and tested with three commercial PCR assays (AurisID, Fungiplex, FungiXpert) and two LDAs (CDC LDA, EMC LDA). LOD was determined using Probit analysis. Diagnostic sensitivity was evaluated by comparing the detection rate of each individual assay to the total detection rate of all assays combined. The EMC LDA exhibited the highest analytical sensitivity, with a LOD of 8 conidia/reaction, followed by CDC LDA (16 conidia/reaction), AurisID and FungiXpert (19 conidia/reaction), and Fungiplex (596 conidia/reaction). Specificity testing revealed cross-reactivity in the CDC LDA and AurisID assays with C. pseudohaemulonii at high conidia levels, while no cross-reactivity was observed in the other assays. EMC LDA showed the highest clinical sensitivity (100%), whereas Fungiplex had the lowest positivity rate (71%). No false positives were observed in negative control swabs for any assay. Real-time PCR is a crucial tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of C. auris , especially in clinical settings where timely identification is essential for effective patient management and infection control. Numerous PCR assays are available for this purpose; however, our study demonstrates that the sensitivity of these assays can vary significantly. The observed differences underscore the importance of establishing international reference standards and proficiency panels to enhance the accuracy and comparability of assay performance across different studies and laboratories.",

  "abstract": "Nursing homes (NHs) were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known regarding the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in NH residents and staff, which could inform treatment and infection prevention. We enrolled NH residents and staff in eight US states from April to November 2023 and analyzed the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 using serial antigen and molecular (RT-PCR) tests, whole genome sequencing, and viral culture (VC). Symptoms, vaccination, and treatment were collected via interviews and chart review. Viral load trajectories were modeled with gamma distribution functional forms. Antigen and VC test positivity over time were assessed using a Chi-squared test. Of the 587 enrolled participants, 86 tested positive and 73 underwent testing for ≥ 10 days; most residents (78%) and staff (87%) had ≥ 3 COVID-19 vaccine doses. The modeled SARS-CoV-2 proliferation period (period prior to reaching peak viral load) had ended for 48% (14/29) of residents and 56% (9/16) of staff when they took the initial RT-PCR test. Both antigen and VC showed higher positivity rates early in the course of disease (Days 0-5 vs. Days ≥ 6) (antigen: p < 0·001, VC: p < 0·001). VC positivity was 15% after Day 5 (14/96); two participants were VC positive after Day 10. Peak viral load occurs early in the disease, suggesting asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission may be a significant driver of transmission. Only two participants had a positive VC after Day 10, supporting current isolation and return to work recommendations.",

We aimed to assess the performance of a novel blood-based test leveraging DNA methylation patterns for simultaneous detection of lung (LC), breast (BrC), colorectal (CRC), and prostate (PCa) cancer. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) methylation data, we identified shared hypermethylated gene promoters (ADCY4, MIR129-2, NID2, and MAGI2) among those four cancers. Validation was performed using online datasets, an in-house tissue set (N = 179), and plasma samples (N = 485) using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The test showed sensitivities of 81.82% (lung), 45% (breast), 69.23% (colorectal), and 44.14% (prostate), with 91.04% specificity. Overall, the PanCancer panel achieved 60.1% sensitivity and 87.4% specificity in detecting these four cancers. In early-stage cancers, sensitivities were slightly lower but followed a similar trend. Additionally, the test detected nine other cancer types in plasma. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of a single methylation-targeted blood test for multi-cancer detection, offering potential as an affordable and scalable screening tool for early cancer detection.",

  "abstract": "The burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) and its provincial trends in Iran remain unknown. Herein, we explore PD data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study nationally and provincially from 1990 to 2021. We used age-standardized incidence (ASIR), prevalence (ASPR), and mortality (ASMR) rates to determine disparities and trends overall and by sex, age, and geographic locations. Univariate analysis and regression were performed to scrutinize the mean differences and associations between socioeconomic factors and different PD outcomes. The ASIR and ASPR of PD increased by 23.1% and 33.2%, respectively, from 1990 to 2021, with estimated total percentage change (TPC) of 0.50 (95%CU: 0.58-0.43) and 0.30 (0.37-0.24), respectively. In 2021, East Azarbayejan had the highest ASIR and ASPR. From 1999 to 2021, the ASMR decreased significantly across individuals aged below 85 years nationally. Overall, 71.0% provinces experienced a downward trend in the ASMR, with the highest decrease in the TPC (-0.21,-0.37-0.01) occurring in Markazi. Significant differences in the PD outcomes between males and females were noted (P < 0.05). There was a significant positive association between the ASPR and the human development index (HDI), urbanization rate, and annual income per rural households. From 1999 to 2021, the incidence and prevalence of PD in Iran and its provinces increased significantly regardless of age and sex classification. Intervention and screening programs should continue to reduce mortality from PD in Iran, but with different priorities between provinces.",

  "abstract": "Melanoma poses a significant health concern due to its propensity to metastasize and its high mortality rate. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment strategy for harnessing the patient's immune system to fight tumor cells. However, not all patients respond equally to immunotherapy, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers to identify potential responders and optimize treatment strategies. Using data from 579 immunology-related genes evaluated by the NanoString nCounter Human Immunology v2 Panel, we integrated transcriptomic data with the clinical characteristics of 35 individuals to develop a predictive signature for immunotherapy response in melanoma patients. Through comprehensive analysis, we identified 18 genes upregulated in non-responder patients and three upregulated in responder patients. In multivariate analysis, CD24, NFIL3, FN1, and KLRK1 were identified as key predictors with significant potential for forecasting treatment outcomes. We then calculated a score incorporating the expression levels of these genes. The score achieved high accuracy in discriminating responders from non-responders, with an area under the curve of 0.935 (p < 0.001). The signature was also significantly associated with progression-free survival, overall survival, and survival following immunotherapy (p < 0.001). The validation of the signature in two independent cohorts confirmed its robustness and applicability, with areas under the curve of 0.758 (p = 0.036) and 0.833 (p = 0.004), respectively. This study represents a significant advance in precision medicine for melanoma. By identifying patients unlikely to benefit from immunotherapy, our approach could help optimize treatment allocation and improve patient outcomes. KEY MESSAGES: Novel 4-gene signature predicts immunotherapy failure in melanoma. High accuracy for personalized treatment decisions. Signature associated with decreased survival for non-responders. Signature validated in independent cohorts, enhancing generalizability. Potential to tailor treatment strategies and avoid unnecessary burden to patients.",

  "abstract": "Goose astrovirus (GAstV) is an emerging pathogen that is widely distributed throughout China and can cause visceral gout, resulting in serious economic losses for the goose industry. Open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of this virus encodes the precursor capsid protein, which is essential for the assembly and antigenicity of these virions. To construct a bi-valent vaccine for controlling GAstV and duck enteritis virus (DEV) infection, an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of the DEV vaccine strain pDEV-EF1 was used to establish a recombinant DEV vector for GAstV ORF2 gene delivery. GAstV ORF2 expression frame was inserted into the US7 and US8 intergenic region of DEV genome by Red E/T two-step recombinant technology, then the recombinant virus rDEV-GAstV ORF2 was rescued by transfecting recombinant clone pDEV-GAstV ORF2 into chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs). The expression of ORF2 in CEFs and formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) were analysed by Western blotting, indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and immunogold electron microscopy (IEM), individually. And protein celluar localization was analysed by IFA. Using this rDEV-GAstV ORF2 vector to infect CEFs was sufficient to elicit GAstV Cap protein expression, as confirmed by Western blotting and IFA. IEM also revealed the formation of VLPs within cells expressing this Cap protein. DEV is a good viral vector for GAstV ORF2 gene delivery and these results provide a basis for the development of a bivalent vaccine for controlling DEV and GAstV infections.",

  "abstract": "Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and tuberculosis (TB) pose significant risks to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) receiving biological therapy. However, data on the prevalence of these infections in Syria are scarce. We conducted a retrospective chart review of IBD patients receiving biologic therapy at Damascus Hospital and Ibn Al-Nafees Hospital, two major public institutions in Syria, between January 2021 and November 2024. A minimum sample size of 130 was estimated; however, all available records were reviewed. Among 185 IBD patients (104 from Damascus and 81 from Ibn Al-Nafees), 51.4% had ulcerative colitis and 47.6% had Crohn's disease. The smoking prevalence was 9.2%, which was higher in Crohn's disease (5.9%) than in ulcerative colitis (3.2%). TST performed in 61.1% of patients, with 4.3% positivity, and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) in 8.7% (1.1% positive). Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HBc antibodies were found in 2.7% and 5.4% of the patients, respectively, while hepatitis C seroprevalence was low (0.5%). CMV seropositivity was high in Damascus (50.8%), with two cases (1.1%) of CMV colitis. Biologic therapies included infliximab (42.7%), ustekinumab (24.3%), golimumab (10.8%), and adalimumab (6.5%). Data gaps, particularly in viral serology and TB screening, are notable. This study identifies deficiencies in TB/hepatitis B screening (notably anti-HBs Ab) and elevated CMV seroprevalence among Syrian IBD patients receiving biologics, extending to immunosuppressed cohorts (rheumatology, dermatology, oncology). Insufficient screening heightens occult infection/reactivation risks, necessitating standardized pretreatment protocols to reduce morbidity in high-risk populations. Not applicable.",

This comprehensive review aims to enhance the understanding of pruritus by highlighting important elements in its pathogenesis, including keratinocytes, Merkel cells and mast cells, nerve fibers, histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pathways, and the interaction of itch signals with the central nervous system. Diagnostic evaluation of chronic pruritus may require a meticulous approach, guided by the identification of skin lesions or signs/symptoms of underlying systemic diseases. A comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed medical history, thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory and imaging tests, often supplemented by skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence, is essential. Treatment strategies for chronic pruritus should be individualized based on the etiology identified. General measures, such as emollients, serve as initial interventions, followed by targeted approaches. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, phototherapy, and systemic immunosuppressants address cutaneous inflammation. Antihistamines, antidepressants, and immunosuppressants may be employed based on the specific etiology. Emerging therapies, including biologic drugs and JAK inhibitors, have potential in refractory cases.",

  "abstract": "Multiple rare diagnoses in the neuroinflammatory disease spectrum are associated with a high morbidity and mortality and are refractory to systemic immunotherapies. Owing to disease rarity, there are often barriers or delays in introducing novel treatment protocols. The development of institutional treatment protocols helps to ensure consistent and improved efficiency to help ensure optimal patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary team with aligned interests was created and aided in identifying the need for a new treatment regimen for patients with treatment refractory neuroinflammatory disease. This work group was convened to determine a standardized template for the management of patients requiring intrathecal therapy. After review and assessment of existing clinical case reports, and other supporting documents, the workgroup reached a consensus regarding optimal treatment approaches, created methods for distribution, and education of providers to utilize the developed clinical template. We document our process for creating and implementing a treatment protocol for intrathecal (IT) dexamethasone in children with treatment-refractory neuroinflammatory disease. The treatment protocol was approved by key stakeholders across multiple disciplines as part of a collaborative effort to improve outcomes. We describe eight patients with neuroinflammatory disease treated with IT dexamethasone without adverse events. There are many barriers in the introduction of novel treatment protocols in rare disease. Utilization of a multidisciplinary team can help identify barriers and facilitate protocol development, leading to alternative treatment pathways in those with rare disease. The development of a standardized treatment approach can be an important way to ensure adequate and effective treatment of patients with rare disorders. The implementation process requires institutions to dedicate resources to ensure key stakeholder input to address barriers to implementation, and to provide ongoing input following implementation to assess patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Snails are mollusks or shelled gastropods found everywhere on Earth. Biologically, snail mucus can be described as a multifunctional natural polymeric gel with adhesive and antimicrobial properties, rendering it a promising ingredient in pharmaceutics and biomedical applications. These properties have been exploited in cosmetics and dermatology applications over the last few years. However, the exploration of snail mucus for other biomedical applications, e.g., wound healing and drug delivery, remains new and very promising. Against this backdrop, this review explores the potential of snail mucus for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications, ranging from wound healing to cancer treatment to regenerative engineering. It will be emphasized how its application in wound healing has gained traction owing to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. Beyond wound care, snail mucus has been investigated as a drug delivery vehicle in treating diabetes and targeted cancer therapies. While further extensive research and clinical trials are needed to solidify the efficacy of snail mucus as a biomaterial, this review will shed light on the prospect of using snail mucus alone and in combination with other natural or synthetic biopolymers as soft materials for widespread biomedical applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exploring snail mucus as a biomaterial across various fields, including oncology, drug delivery, cosmetics, antibacterial properties, and wound healing, presents a fascinating avenue for zootherapy research. This review provides an in-depth account of the recent developments in snail mucus' potential for a broad spectrum of biomedical applications, from wound healing to cancer treatment and regenerative engineering. It highlights the growing interest in mucus' use in wound healing, attributed to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has also been investigated as a drug delivery vehicle for diabetes treatment and targeted cancer therapies. The impact of such research is significant, as it could lead to the creation of innovative biomaterials for a wide range of applications, revolutionizing the field of biomaterials.",

  "abstract": "With the advent of disease-modifying therapies for early Alzheimer's disease (AD), a comprehensive characterization of patients initiating lecanemab in the USA is needed to understand its use in real-world settings. This retrospective observational study used administrative claims from the Komodo Research Database (1/1/2023-6/30/2024). Eligible patients had ≥ 1 lecanemab administration (first claim defined the index date) and ≥ 12 months of clinical activity/insurance eligibility before the index date. Patient characteristics, diagnostic process, and AD-related medications were evaluated within 12 months before the index date (baseline), whereas lecanemab treatment patterns and concomitant medications were evaluated on or after the index date (follow-up). Outcomes were reported using descriptive statistics and persistence to lecanemab was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Of 3155 patients included in the study, mean age was 75.0 years, 55.8% were female, 44.2% were male, and most (93.3%) received their index lecanemab administration in an urban setting. Diagnoses of AD (83.8%) and mild cognitive impairment (60.8%) were common at baseline, and 67.6% of patients used AD symptomatic medications. Average time from earliest diagnosis to first lecanemab administration was 4.9 months among patients with a diagnosis in January 2023 (accelerated approval date) or onwards. Over a mean follow-up of 138.8 days, the monthly mean number of administrations of lecanemab was 1.9, with an average of 16.5 days between consecutive administrations and 47.4 days to the first follow-up head magnetic resonance imaging. Persistence to lecanemab was 87.6% at 4 months after treatment initiation. Lecanemab was utilized in appropriate patient populations according to the prescribing information approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Findings from our study provide first insights into the real-world use of lecanemab in the USA and shed light on the need for increased and timely lecanemab initiation for the long-term management of early AD.",

In this international, multicenter, open-label phase II trial, we assessed the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab in stage IIB-IV refractory/relapsed MF and SS. Patients received atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3w for up to 1 year unless progression or withdrawal. The main study endpoints were overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to next systemic treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS). A total of 26 patients were enrolled from seven countries. Seventeen patients met the inclusion criteria. At a median follow-up of 36.6 months, the ORR was 15.4 % in the intention to treat (ITT) and 17.6 % in the per protocol (PP) population, respectively. In the PP group, 58.8 % of patients, and in the ITT group, 53.9 % of patients achieved partial response or stable disease as their best outcome. One complete response was observed after 1 year. Median PFS was 3 months (95 % CI 1.4-4.9) in PP and 3.1 months (95 % CI 2.4-4.0) in ITT. Median OS was not reached for PP and was 22.3 months (20.0-NE) for ITT. Median TTNT was 5.9 months (2.8-NE) in PP and 6.2 months (3.1-14.8) in ITT. The most common grade ≥ 3 adverse events were fatigue (23.1 %) and infections (15.4 %), with two sepsis-related deaths. Atezolizumab was primarily discontinued due to disease progression (50 %). Atezolizumab shows moderate activity in pretreated refractory/relapsed MF and SS. Further studies are needed to identify reliable predictors of safety and treatment response.",

  "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most prevalent genetic kidney disorder, is characterized by diffuse kidney cysts, hypertension, and progressive kidney function decline, often leading to kidney failure by the age of 60 years. Compared with the general population, patients with ADPKD have an increased risk for development of saccular intracranial aneurysms (IAs), which can lead to intracranial bleeding and result in significant disability and mortality. Of both modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors, the most significant is a family history of IAs or aneurysm rupture. Other contributing factors include hypertension, cigarette smoking, age, and sex. Most IAs currently detected during screening tests are small and located in the anterior circulation. Intracranial aneurysms can be manifested with thunderclap headache, which may be indicative of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Less commonly, IAs cause symptoms related to mass effect with focal neurologic deficits. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is particularly concerning, given its high case-fatality rate, which remains around 35% despite advances in neurologic care. Therefore, control of risk factors, early detection, and treatment when indicated are important to prevent adverse outcomes. Screening for IAs in ADPKD remains controversial and can be approached either universally (screening of all ADPKD patients) or selectively (screening of high-risk patients). The preferred imaging modality is brain magnetic resonance angiography without contrast enhancement or alternatively computed tomography angiography. This review provides a practical guide for medical teams managing patients with ADPKD, detailing the characteristics of IAs and their associated symptoms. It presents an algorithm for risk assessment and screening along with recommendations for treatment and follow-up care.",

  "abstract": "Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase inhibitor, offers advantages in psoriasis patients in whom biologics are not approved or accepted and where topical treatments have failed. Psoriasis involving the nails, scalp, and genitals is difficult to treat and is associated with a significant decrease in quality of life, requiring an effective treatment. This study aimed to retrospectively assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast 30 mg twice daily in treating psoriasis limited to the nails. The charts of 55 adult patients with nail psoriasis treated with apremilast were retrospectively evaluated. Baseline characteristics, including the nail psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) and dermatology life quality index (DLQI), were recorded. At 6 months of treatment, a statistically significant decrease in both the NAPSI score (44.7 ± 26.9 vs. 19.03 ± 14.2) and the DLQI score (14.5 ± 5 vs. 7.2 ± 4.1) was observed (p < 0.01). None of the patients discontinued the treatment due to side effects. This study shows improvements in nail psoriasis severity and quality of life with apremilast treatment. Despite potential confounders like psoriatic arthritis, smoking, and manual work, consistent improvements were observed. Apremilast appears to be a valuable treatment option for nail psoriasis. However, further prospective studies are necessary to address the limitations of this retrospective analysis and explore additional endpoints.",

  "abstract": "Tumor-related trigeminal neuralgia (TRTN) accounts for approximately 6% of all facial pain syndromes. Conventional medical treatments have short-term pain relief effects in TRTN cases; however, they are correlated with substantial failure rates of 63-100%. Microsurgical resection (MS) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are the two primary therapeutic options for the management of TRTNs. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the pain-related outcomes and complications of SRS in TRTNs. A systematic literature search was conducted on February 24, 2025, comparing PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Studies reporting pain-related outcomes and adverse radiation effects (ARE) for SRS in TRTNs were included. Nineteen studies with 454 patients were included. Meningioma (67.7%, 304/449) was the most common tumor, followed by vestibular schwannoma (VS) (18.3%, 82/449) and trigeminal schwannoma (8.2%, 37/449). Our meta-analysis demonstrated that SRS is associated with a pooled complete pain-free rate of 38% (95% CI: 27-50%), an adequate pain relief rate of 73% (95% CI: 63-83%), and an ARE rate of 14% (95% CI: 7-22%). In those where the underlying etiology was pertoclival meningiomas, SRS resulted in a pooled complete pain-free rate of 30% (95%CI: 5-64%), an adequate complete pain relief rate of 64% (95%CI: 33-90%), and an ARE rate of 13% (95%CI: 0-48%). SRS is associated with favorable pain-related outcomes and low ARE rates in patients with TRTN. Both tumor-only related and dual-targeted approaches are associated with comparable outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Microneedles (MNs) have been extensively used as transdermal therapeutics delivery devices since 1998 due to their capacity to penetrate physiological barriers with minimal invasiveness. Recent advances demonstrate the potential of MNs in improving diverse tissue regeneration when integrated with nanometer-sized therapeutics or sensors. This synergistic strategy can enhance drug delivery efficiency and therapeutic outcomes, and enable precise and personalized therapies through real-time monitoring of the repair process. In this review, we discuss how optimized MNs (through adjustments in geometry, material properties, and modular structure), when combined with dimension- and composition-specific nanomaterials, enhance tissue regeneration efficiency. Moreover, integrating stimuli-responsive nanotherapeutics or nanosensors into MNs for spatiotemporal-controlled and targeted drug release, physiotherapy effects, and intelligent monitoring is systematically outlined. Furthermore, we summarize therapeutic applications of nanotherapeutics-MN platforms in various soft and hard tissues, including skin, hair follicles (HF), cornea, joint, tendons, sciatic nerves, spinal cord, periodontium, oral mucosa, myocardium, endometrium, bone and intervertebral discs (IVD). Notably, recent attempts using nanosensor-MN platforms as smart wearable devices for monitoring damaged tissues via interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and biomarker sensing are analyzed. This review potentially provides tissue regeneration practitioners/researchers with a cross-disciplinary perspective and inspiration.",

  "abstract": "Seeking medical attention promptly after an acute stroke is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. However, delayed medical intervention after acute stroke contributes to increased mortality and morbidity. This study explored factors that contribute to the delayed appearance of stroke patients at the emergency department. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted for 9 months at a referral hospital in Addis Ababa. Data was collected using questionnaires administered to stroke patients or their caregivers upon their arrival at the emergency department. Electronic medical records were further reviewed, and the treating physicians described the subsequent management of the patient after their arrival at the emergency department. Data was analyzed using descriptive and analytic parameters. Only 33.3% (n = 30) arrived at the emergency department within 4.5 h. Hemorrhagic stroke was a statistically significant predictor of early presentation to the emergency department (OR = 3.182; 95% CI (1.258-8.046); p = 0.036). The absence of any substance was another marginally significant predictor for early appearance (OR = 2.555; 95% (0.936-6.970); p = 0.067). One of the marginally significant predictors for late presentation was low drug adherence (OR = 0.224; 95% CI (0.48-1.044); p = 0.057). The other factors attributed to the time of arrival, though not statistically significant, were level of education, perception of stroke as a serious illness, and prior number of health visits before arrival to the emergency department. The study found that many of the factors that cause delays in getting to the hospital can be changed, except for the type of stroke. Time spent in the hospital could also be positively impacted by the intervention from the appropriate authorities.",

Given the high incidence and often limited treatment options, understanding the complexity of the BrM tumor microenvironment is crucial for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We performed transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling combined with spatial immune cell profiling to characterize the tumor immune microenvironment in 95 patients with BrM from different primary tumors. We found that BrM from lung carcinoma and malignant melanoma showed overall higher immune cell infiltration as compared to BrM from breast carcinoma. RNA sequencing-based immune cell deconvolution revealed gene expression signatures indicative of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) in subsets of BrM, mostly from lung cancer and melanoma. This finding was corroborated by multiplex immunofluorescence staining of immune cells in BrM tissue sections. Detection of TLS signatures was more common in treatment-naïve BrM and associated with prolonged survival after BrM diagnosis in lung cancer patients. Our findings highlight the cellular diversity of the tumor immune microenvironment in BrM of different cancer types and suggest a role of TLS formation for BrM patient outcome.",

  "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by the degeneration of the nervous system, leading to impaired motor and non-motor functions. Early symptoms include tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, with progressive deterioration over time. This study employs a multi-criteria decision-making approach, integrating Fuzzy TOPSIS and Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship (QSPR) analysis, to evaluate and rank 17 Parkinson's disease medications based on their physicochemical properties. Molecular structures were encoded as adjacency matrices using MATLAB 2017, and six Sombor index variants-computed via a custom Maple 2020 algorithm-served as topological descriptors for QSPR modeling. Eight critical physicochemical properties were analyzed: polarizability (P), boiling point (BP), surface tension (ST), polar surface area (PSA), flash point (FP), molar refractivity (MR), enthalpy of vaporization (EV), and molar volume (MV). The Fuzzy TOPSIS ranking revealed bromocriptine as the top-performing drug for boiling point (BP), while comparative rankings across all properties are tabulated for clinical reference. Validation metrics, including coefficient of determination, mean squared error , and mean absolute error, confirmed model robustness. Notably, surface tension (ST) and polar surface area (PSA) showed weaker correlations (R  < 0.5, p > 0.05), highlighting limitations in their predictability via Sombor indices. This work demonstrates the utility of combining chemical graph theory, QSPR modeling, and Fuzzy TOPSIS for rational drug evaluation in neurodegenerative disorders. The methodology offers a framework for prioritizing therapeutics based on physicochemical profiles, with implications for optimizing Parkinson's disease management.",

  "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a common chemotherapeutic agent, is often associated with dose-limiting hepatotoxicity. Alamandine, a peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, has shown antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may counteract these adverse effects. This study investigated the protective effects of alamandine on DOX-induced liver injury in rats. Male Wistar rats received DOX (3.75 mg/kg intraperitoneally) on days 14, 21, 28, and 35, reaching a cumulative dose of 15 mg/kg. Alamandine (50 µg/kg/day) was administered continuously via mini-osmotic pumps for 42 days. Liver toxicity was assessed through biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, and liver enzymes, as well as histological examination. DOX administration significantly increased serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while reducing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity. Histological analysis revealed hydropic degeneration and hepatocyte necrosis. Alamandine co-treatment restored SOD and CAT activity, reduced MDA and inflammatory markers, and normalized liver enzyme levels, indicating significant hepatoprotection. Furthermore, treatment with alamandine reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, and NF-κB induced by DOX, while p53 expression remained unchanged. Alamandine effectively mitigates DOX-induced hepatotoxicity, demonstrating its therapeutic potential as an adjunctive agent in chemotherapy through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.",

We found that these new susceptibility loci exhibit sex- and age-specific effect on aging skin risk as well as implicated in interactions with modifiable risk factors including water intake, micronutrient care, sleeping habits, sun exposure and application of sunscreen cream, in the development of an increased risk of aging skin.

  "abstract": "This study aims to identify neighborhood-level inequities in prehospital stroke care, including EMS utilization and last known well (LKW) to ED presentation, in a small state with one large comprehensive stroke center. This was a retrospective observational study using 2 years of data (2020-2022) from Get With The Guidelines combined with data collected by a large hospital system in Rhode Island that includes a comprehensive stroke center (CSC), the Rhode Island emergency management system database, and 2020 census data. Census tract disadvantage was significantly associated with LKW to ED arrival times, with individuals from more disadvantaged neighborhoods presenting almost a full hour later than individuals from the least disadvantaged neighborhoods (56.9 min, 95% confidence interval 14.9-90.3 min). EMS use was the strongest predictor of LKW to ED arrival times, and the Latinx population was significantly less likely to utilize EMS compared to the White population. Understanding geographical inequities in stroke recognition and prehospital stroke care can help mitigate important socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities. In addition, geospatial analysis provides useful information for targeting intervention strategies to neighborhoods with the longest LKW to ED arrival times and lowest use of EMS.",

  "abstract": "Transcatheter device closure is the method of choice for the closure of secundum atrial septal defects (ASD) with appropriate anatomic characteristics, leading to symptomatic relief, increased survival rates, cardiac remodeling, and improved cardiac function. Assessing the impact of transcatheter ASD closure on echocardiographic indices and comparing them between individuals younger and older than 50. In this retrospective cohort study, 240 patients with isolated secundum ASD and complete documentation and follow-up data who underwent transcatheter device closure between 2015 and 2019 were included. Demographic, peri-procedural, and echocardiographic findings were compared before and after the procedure and among two age groups. A total of 240 patients (68% female, 44% younger than 50) with a median age of 51 underwent transcatheter ASD closure. ASD closure led to a significant decline in the size of four cardiac chambers and systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (SPAP), in addition to a significant improvement in biventricular systolic function, LV diastolic function, and valvular insufficiencies. Although patients aged 50 and older had worse LV diastolic and RV systolic function, in addition to larger RV size and bi-atrial dimensions at the baseline, the extent of improvement of these parameters among them was significantly more pronounced than those younger than 50. There were no significant differences in the extent of the decline in SPAP between the two groups. Transcatheter ASD device closure is a beneficial procedure with high success rates and low complication rates among older individuals, eventually leading to improvements in cardiac form and function.",

  "abstract": "Pneumonia represents a significant global health burden with high morbidity and mortality rates, despite advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies. Airway clearance techniques (ACT), including High-Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), are critical in managing respiratory conditions. However, the combined effectiveness of BiPAP and HFCWO in treating adult pneumonia remains underexplored. A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a college hospital in southern Taiwan, enrolling patients aged ≥ 18 years, admitted for pneumonia from January 2020 to December 2022, who received HFCWO therapy for ≥ 5 days in the ordinary ward. Exclusion criteria included prior mechanical ventilation before HFCWO initiation. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the effectiveness of the combined use of BiPAP and HFCWO. A total of 271 patients received HFCWO and were enrolled for analysis, including 163 patients who received both BiPAP and HFCWO. Patients receiving both BiPAP and HFCWO were associated with decreased frequency of sputum suction (OR: 2.91, 95% CI: 1.46-5.78, P = 0.002), and reduced oxygen need post-HFCWO (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.33-0.91, P = 0.021). However, there was no difference in hospital stay, respiratory failure, ICU admission, or hospital death between the groups. Additionally, there was no difference in these outcomes for patients who received HFCWO twice daily compared to those who received it once daily. Combining BiPAP and HFCWO reduces the need for sputum suction and improves oxygen demand for patients but does not change hospital days, respiratory failure, or mortality. Further large prospective cohort studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this management approach.",

  "abstract": "Intellectual disability is the subject of interest of psychiatry and special education. Both sciences in Poland adopt an inclusive model of care for people with disabilities. The path of each of them from a directive model to an inclusive model has been different. The aim of the study is to compare the attitude towards people with intellectual disabilities and the evolution of changes that have taken place in Polish special education and in Polish psychiatry in the last few decades. The comparison was carried out using the narrative method through a review of key publications on the understanding of the intellectual disability phenomenon by special education in Poland and by psychiatry. In 1989, Polish special education departed from dialectical materialism as a binding doctrine in the social sciences. A postmodern understanding of the phenomenon of disability, culminating in the formulation of a humanistic paradigm of special education consisting of four microparadigms, developed instead. Special education moved away from quantitative research in favor of qualitative research, negating the biomedical aspects of disability. Qualitative and conceptual research studies carried out in Poland have not entered the global circulation of scientific information and are known locally in Poland. Polish psychiatry has undergone a less revolutionary path of change than special education. The development of community psychiatry in Western Europe slowly began to be implemented in Poland. It has been implemented in recent years in the form of mental health centers. Since the beginning of the political transformation, Polish psychiatry has been present in international journals in published English with the Impact Factor. Despite the postmodern, inclusive understanding of mental disorders, but in contrast to Polish special education, Polish psychiatry is based on quantitative research studies. Their results are published in international journals. Polish special pedagogy of people with intellectual disabilities, as well as Polish psychiatry, have undergone a significant paradigmatic reconstruction in the last few decades. Both sciences adopted an inclusive model of understanding intellectual disability. The different ways of development of the two sciences are reflected in publications and scientific research, as well as in certain terminological differences.",

  "abstract": "Females have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). The innate immune system plays a key role in AD pathology, and sex differences in innate immune responses may contribute to differences in disease risk and progression. This study investigated sex differences in innate immune responses among participants without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) determined amyloid pathology [A-; cognitively normal (CN),   = 83] and those with amyloid pathology (A+,   = 202), further stratified into preclinical (CN with A+,   = 72) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI with A+,   = 130). Participants were drawn from the Norwegian Dementia Disease Initiation cohort (  = 285). We measured plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CSF concentrations of nine innate immune markers: soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), fractalkine, chitinase 3-like 1 (YKL-40), clusterin, interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-18. Linear regression was used, adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. In A+ cases (  = 202, females = 105), females had lower MCP-1 (     0.01), IL-6 and IL-18 (both      0.05) than males, while no sex differences were observed in A- cases (  = 83, females = 39). Among A+ participants, no sex differences were observed in CN cases (  = 72, females = 37), but females (  = 68) with MCI had lower MCP-1 and IL-6 (both      0.05) than males (  = 62) with MCI. Moreover, A+ females exhibited stronger positive associations between sTREM2 and clusterin with CSF total tau (  < 0.001;   < 0.05) and Neurofilament light chain (  < 0.01;   < 0.01) than males. These findings suggest sex-specific differences in innate immune responses, which may contribute to disease progression in amyloid-positive individuals.",

However, the mechanisms underlying primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the biomarkers associated with primary resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs was defined as disease progression within 90 days (3 months) of treatment in patients with EGFR-sensitive mutant adenocarcinoma without any evidence of objective response. Retrospective, single-center study. This study retrospectively screened patients with NSCLC who received EGFR-TKIs at Hunan Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. According to pre-determined clinical outcomes, we divided the patients into primary resistance and sensitivity groups. Only patients with sufficient samples that passed quality control were included in this study. Tumor tissue and paired peripheral blood samples collected from patients before treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing using an 825-gene panel. In addition, tumor tissue samples were analyzed for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this study, with 35 in each of the primary resistant and sensitive groups. Patients with exon 4 mutations in the   gene had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those without the mutation.   and   mutation frequencies were substantially higher in the primary resistant group and were associated with shorter PFS and OS. Furthermore, patients in the primary resistant group exhibited substantially higher levels of PD-L1 expression. The potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs are highly heterogeneous. Combining some somatic variants affecting tumor function and high PD-L1 expression may contribute to this resistance.",

  "abstract": "Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in elderly patients is a common and life-threatening condition, often complicated by comorbidities. The ratio of red blood cell distribution width to albumin (RAR) has recently been proposed as a prognostic marker in various diseases, but its role in predicting adverse outcomes in GIB patients remains unclear. A total of 51,824 aged 65 years or older patients were initially screened for inclusion in the study. After excluding those lost to follow-up, with missing vital information during the screening period (n = 50,423), 1401 hospitalized patients with GIB in Beijing Hospital (2013-2019) were included. Restricted cubic spline modeling and logistic regression analyses assessed the relationships between RAR, adverse outcomes, and in hospital mortality. Among the 1, 401 patients, 648 experienced adverse outcomes, and 427 patients died during hospitalization. Higher RAR was significantly associated with an increased risk of both in-hospital mortality and adverse outcomes, even after adjusting for age, sex, education level, body mass index (BMI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), white blood cell count (WBC), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hemoglobin, heart failure, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and heart rate. RAR is a novel and independent predictor of mortality and adverse outcomes in elderly patients with GIB. Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness make it a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patients. Further studies in larger, multicenter cohorts are needed to confirm these findings and evaluate the clinical benefits of RAR-based interventions.",

  "abstract": "Advanced care planning (ACP) and advance medical directives (AMDs) are vital for aligning medical decisions with patient preferences, particularly for end-of-life care. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment in India established the legality of AMDs, enabling patients to exercise their autonomy. Recent amendments in 2023 simplified procedural requirements, replacing judicial magistrate approval with a streamlined two-tier medical board system. This article proposes a culturally sensitive and practical 12-step framework for implementing ACP and AMDs in India. A structured and consensus-driven process was undertaken by experts in palliative medicine, neurology, critical care, and geriatrics, supported by key medical organizations. The development process included multiple iterations, public consultations, and feedback from legal and medical stakeholders. The framework integrates legal, ethical, and cultural considerations to address procedural and systemic challenges in ACP implementation. The proposed 12-step pathway focuses on three phases: creating living wills, periodic reviews and updates, and executing AMDs. Key components include initiating discussions, identification and appointment of surrogate decision-makers, ensuring legal compliance through simplified procedures, and providing guidance for withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments. Implementation strategies emphasize public awareness, provider training, and institutional policies to normalize ACP. Simplified legal requirements introduced in 2023 facilitate broader adoption and reduce procedural barriers. This framework provides a practical, culturally relevant model for ACP in India, ensuring patient-centered, ethical, and transparent end-of-life care. By integrating simplified legal procedures and addressing misconceptions through education and policy initiatives, the proposed approach empowers individuals, families, and healthcare providers to make informed decisions, fostering dignity and autonomy in medical care.

  "abstract": "This study aimed to present our early experience with minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation (MiECC) circuits and compare it with conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (cCPB). Two hundred thirty-nine patient registries (169 males, 70 females; mean age: 63.5 years) who underwent surgery were retrospectively analyzed between June 2021 and February 2024. All patients were operated by the same surgical team with a restrictive blood transfusion protocol. Forty-five (18.8%) cases were identified as MiECC. Most of the operations were coronary artery bypass grafting. Significant differences were observed between those operated on with MiECC and cCPB regarding the transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) suspensions and the total amount of drainage. No significant differences were observed in the duration of intubation, incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury, and intensive care unit or hospital stay. In geriatric patients, transfusion of RBC suspensions and drainage was significantly lower. Duration of intubation and intensive care unit or hospital stay did not reach statistical significance. In patients with an ejection fraction ≤45, transfusion of RBC suspensions were similarly low. The utilization of MiECC resulted in a reduction in transfusion of RBC suspensions and postoperative drainage. No significant differences were observed in intubation time, postoperative acute kidney injury, hospitalization, or mortality. Although intubation time was observed to be shorter, no statistically significant result could be reached. There is a potential for bias in patient selection due to the potential benefits of MiECC. We believe that with a larger number of blinded studies, the benefits of MiECC can be demonstrated in more detail, particularly in specialized populations such as geriatric patients and patients with low EF.",

While comorbidities have been shown as predictors of poor pneumonia outcomes, the interplay between chronic comorbidities and acute physiological conditions, reflected by systemic biomarkers, remains underexplored. This study investigates the independent and joint effects of dementia and acute biomarkers on 30-day readmission risk following pneumonia hospitalization. We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from three hospitals within the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database. Patients aged ≥45 years hospitalized for pneumonia between 2014 and 2021 were included. Dementia status was identified via ICD-9/10 codes, and acute systemic biomarkers were measured at the time of emergency department presentation. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause readmission. Multivariable logistic regression assessed independent associations, while joint-effects models examined the combined impact of dementia with biomarker abnormalities and comorbidities. Among 11,989 patients, 6.7% experienced 30-day readmission. Dementia was independently associated with readmission (adjusted OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.61). Other significant predictors included abnormal hemoglobin (OR: 1.55), creatinine (OR: 1.42), glucose (OR: 1.32), and comorbidities such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Joint-effects models showed that dementia amplified the impact of abnormal biomarkers, eg, patients with low hemoglobin and dementia had an OR of 1.98 compared to those with normal hemoglobin and no dementia. Dementia and acute biomarker abnormalities independently and synergistically increase 30-day readmission risk after pneumonia hospitalization, underscoring the need for integrated management strategies targeting both cognitive and systemic health.",

  "abstract": " Cancer treatments are not a one-size-fits-all approach, treatment options are rarely studied in aging individuals, leading to worse outcomes related to increased vulnerability in this group of patients.   Since frailty has shown the ability to modify outcomes, our study aims to assess if frailty modifies the association between performance status and days in bed with mortality risk in older adults with cancer.   Our study is a secondary analysis of the Mexican Health and Aging Study, a cohort with a representative sample of individuals aged 50 years or older, with a baseline assessment in 2001 and follow-up data available for the years 2003, 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021. We extracted the baseline variables from the main questionnaires, and the next-of-kin questionnaires were employed for information regarding mortality. We used Cox regression and Kaplan‒Meier curves for survival analysis.   Our sample was composed of 318 individuals, with a mean age of 68.02 years (± SD 10.78), and 62.57% were women. Cox regression revealed that age was a significant risk factor for mortality in frail patients but not in those with low frailty levels.   in settings where access to a geriatric assessment is limited or would significantly delay cancer-specific therapies, assessing frailty might improve the accuracy of those available cancer prognostic tools that might underperform in frail older adults.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using version 8.3.9.2 of SEER*Stat software to extract data from the SEER 17 Plus database. Patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioblastoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2019 were included to calculate overall survival (OS), relative survival (RS), and conditional survival. R software was used to calculate univariate and multivariate Cox regression models for age, sex, and race to identify their effect on survival. We included 45,071 patients with grade IV glioblastoma according to WHO 2016 classification. The observed 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates showed a decline to 40.1%, 9.8%, and 5.2%, respectively. Similarly, the relative 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 40.7%, 10.2%, and 5.4%, respectively. The conditional 3-year survival rates improved up to 16.9%, 42.9%, and 60.2% after 1, 3, and 5 years of survival, correspondingly, with females showing better estimates. The most common cancer CODs were the brain and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers. Among non-glioblastoma cancer CODs, breast cancer was the most common cause. Additionally, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and septicemia were the most common non-cancer CODs. In this study, patients with glioblastoma showed a sharp decline in OS and RS over time after diagnosis. However, there was a notable improvement in conditional 3-year survival over time. Cardiovascular diseases emerged as the most common non-cancer COD, with lower survival rates in males and advanced age.",

  "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of pathologic overactivation of the immune system that leads to excessive inflammation and tissue destruction. It can be genetic or acquired in the setting of infection, autoimmune disorders, or malignancy. Here we present a case report of a patient who was initially thought to have severe disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) but was ultimately diagnosed with HLH per the 2004 criteria, most likely secondary to   infection. A 69-year-old female presented with cough, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and altered mental status. Laboratory findings were significant for coagulopathy initially thought to be DIC, but she was subsequently diagnosed with HLH. Bone marrow biopsy showed increased histiocytes showing hemophagocytosis. The trigger for the HLH was initially unclear, but the patient was eventually found to meet Q fever criteria after being found to be positive for  . She underwent treatment with the HLH-94 protocol, which includes high-dose steroids and etoposide with normalization of hematologic labs and resolution of symptoms. She was also treated with a standard course of doxycycline for  . HLH should be considered in patients who present with DIC-like labs and other hematologic abnormalities. In such cases, using the H score can assist in raising suspicion for reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. A biopsy of the involved site, such as bone marrow, showing increased hemophagocytosis can also help with confirming the diagnosis. It is important for early identification and initiation of treatment for HLH to improve survival outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS) is a benign yet locally aggressive proliferative lesion arising from the synovium of tendon sheaths, bursae, or joints. It most commonly affects the hands and feet, with toe involvement being particularly rare. We present a case of a 41-year-old male with a painful, firm mass on the big toe, initially suspected to be gout. Imaging studies, which included an MRI, revealed a well-defined soft tissue mass with marked cortical erosion of the first metatarsal, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of GCT-TS. The patient underwent marginal excision of the lesion, with no recurrence at follow-up. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with GCT-TS in uncommon locations and highlights the utilization of MRI in assessing tumor extent and guiding preoperative planning. Despite its benign nature, the risk of recurrence necessitates complete excision and careful postoperative monitoring. The emergence of molecular therapies, such as CSF1R inhibitors, shows promise for recurrent or inoperable cases. Early recognition, precise surgical intervention, and a multidisciplinary approach in tackling this tumor are crucial for optimizing outcomes and preventing recurrence in atypical presentations of GCT-TS.",

  "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare but serious complication that poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article presents three cases of leptomeningeal involvement in patients with MM, highlighting the diverse clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies employed. The first case is a 54-year-old female who, after initial treatment and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, developed CNS disease. Similarly, a 73-year-old female developed leptomeningeal involvement with progressive neurological symptoms. The third case describes a 63-year-old female with immunoglobulin (Ig)A lambda MM who developed CNS disease after treatment with daratumumab and radiation. In all three cases, leptomeningeal enhancement and atypical plasma cells were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with treatment strategies including intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiation, and stem cell transplantation. Despite aggressive management, including novel agents and supportive care, all patients had poor outcomes, with two transitioning to hospice care. The article reviews the limited literature on CNS-MM, noting the lack of standardized treatment protocols and the need for further research. As the survival of MM patients improves, the incidence of CNS involvement is expected to rise, making the development of targeted therapies essential. These cases underscore the urgent need for further investigation into novel treatment options and the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management of CNS-MM.",

  "abstract": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CCMP) is one of the well-defined toxicities associated with chemotherapy use that can lead to serious side effects. An example of a chemotherapeutic drug class that has been well documented over the years to cause CCMP is anthracyclines. To date, few studies have been carried out in Saudi Arabia on the prevalence of CCMP and the associated risk factors. Therefore, the objective of our research is to measure the prevalence and determine the risk factors of such phenomena. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. Data from 114 patients was retrieved from the medical records of the cardiac department at Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City. The research included pediatric oncology patients aged 14 or under who were treated with anthracyclines from June 2016 to May 2024. We excluded patients who did not undergo ECHO. A consecutive sampling technique was used to collect the patients. Over the eight-year study period, we found that 7.34% (8/109) of the cohort developed CCMP, with a mean age at diagnosis of 6.39 ± 3.81 years. The mean dose of anthracycline received until the diagnosis of CCMP was 194.77±145.92 mg, with a median interval between anthracycline initiation and CCMP diagnosis of 13.65 (3-89) weeks. A significant association was found between thromboembolism, PDA, type of cancer, and the development of CCMP. We found that traditional predictors such as gender, age at diagnosis, and cumulative anthracycline dose were not predictors of CCMP.",

  "abstract": "digestive cancers (DC) are a group of cancers affecting the gastrointestinal tract and are capable of triggering an immune response. The cells produced during this response are tumor effectors whose role is to rid the body of tumor cells. The functional role of these cells, particularly the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), in the prognosis of patients remains poorly understood in Cameroon. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of lymphocyte infiltration on the survival of patients with certain digestive cancers. we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Oncology Department and the Anatomo-Cytopathology Laboratory of the Yaoundé General Hospital (YGH). Patients histologically diagnosed with colorectal and gastric cancers with available data from YGH between 2019 and 2023, who consented to participate and had a biopsy sample available at the YGH laboratory, were included in the study. Initially, we described patients' sociodemographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics. Then, we estimated the grade of lymphocyte infiltration in colorectal and gastric cancers using Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and analyzed the correlation between lymphocyte infiltration and patient survival through Cox regression. Data were analyzed with a significance level set at 5% for all comparisons. the study enrolled 90 patients with colorectal cancer and 50 with gastric cancer. Overall survival was 64.8% at 49 months in the study population, with the median not reached for colorectal cancer, and 64% at 39 months for gastric cancer, also with a median not reached. The average age at diagnosis for colorectal and gastric cancers was 54 ± 14.53 years and 53.24 ± 11.41 years, respectively. Men predominated in both pathologies, with a sex ratio of approximately 1.11. Colonic location was predominant (53%; 46/90) for colorectal cancer, with stage III disease being most common, while the antropyloric location (46%; 23/50) was predominant for gastric cancer, with stage IV being most frequent according to the AJCC. Moreover, 86% of patients had TILs in their histological samples, with a predominance of high TILs in both colorectal (38%; 34/90) and gastric (42%; 21/50) cancers. The performance of chemotherapy was inversely proportional to TILs in colorectal cancer, while no significant difference was found between TILs and chemotherapy in gastric cancer. However, no association was found between TILs and patient survival in either colorectal or gastric cancers. Patients who had metastases had a risk of death of 14.07 (aHR: 14.07, 95% CI 1.66-119.24; p = 0.015) compared with those who did not. Similarly, patients who had not taken chemotherapy had a 21.32 greater risk of death (aHR: 21.32, 95% CI 5.35-84.96; p<0.001) than those who had. there was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients suffering from colorectal and gastric cancers, and the grade of lymphocyte infiltration. Survival was significantly impacted by the presence of metastasis and the absence of treatment.",

The BCN is a core multidisciplinary member of the breast cancer team. The evaluation of care models is necessary to detect gaps and improve the quality of care.   This cross-sectional descriptive study took place in a breast pathology unit and included patients with early breast cancer seen between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017 after finishing their treatment. Between July and December 2018, sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected from the clinical history, and satisfaction was measured using a questionnaire sent to the patients.   Of the 139 patients included, 99.3% reported that the BCN provided information correctly, 96.2% reported that she provided adequate information on self-care at home (96.2%), and 97.8% reported that the words of the BCN helped them feel better. However, some patients were unsure whether the BCN would have been willing to discuss alternative therapies (41%).   Patients were satisfied with the BCN, including her role in meeting information and support needs. However, some issues needed to be sufficiently addressed. Comprehensive, continuous assessment is required to understand patient needs. Training and specific studies on topics that are of interest to patients can help respond to these needs.   BCN functions are being developed in some countries. BCN results make it easier for healthcare managers to commit to this role and for nurses to develop all their competencies. BCN models must respond to international guidelines but are also determined by organizational resources. The evaluation of these models is essential and must be considered by users. Advanced practice nursing roles, including the BCN, are well established in some countries but developing in others. BCN results make it easier for healthcare managers to commit to this role and for nurses to develop all their skills. BCN models must respond to the elements determined by organizations that work to improve the quality of care for patients with breast cancer. However, they are also determined by organizational resources. The evaluation of these models is essential to correct deficiencies and improve the quality of care. An important part of the evaluation must take into account the user who receives the care, in terms of satisfaction and the form of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).",

  "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) who have not responded to gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP)-based therapy is dismal. Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy could be considered for those patients who are refractory to GP-based treatments. Our study aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of 5-FU-based chemotherapy for BTC patients who had progressed after gemcitabine-based treatment. This study analyzed patients from Seoul St. Mary's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital with advanced BTC who had previously failed treatment with GP-based chemotherapy. From June 2020 and May 2024, these patients received 5-FU-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment. The 5-FU-based systemic treatments encompassed 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX); 5-FU, leucovorin, and liposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI/FL); and 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Our investigation focused on evaluating the survival outcomes and safety profiles of each regimen within this cohort. In our analysis of 147 patients, the primary tumor sites were distributed with 56 (38.1%) having intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 51 (34.7%) with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 40 (27.2%) with gallbladder cancer. Regarding the 5-FU-based regimens, 57 patients (38.8%) were treated with FOLFOX, 56 (38.1%) with Nal-IRI/FL, and 34 (23.1%) with FOLFIRINOX. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-2.6) and 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.8-5.8), respectively. Poor performance status and higher histologic grade were associated with worse PFS and OS, while female gender and prior surgery were linked to improved OS. FOLFOX and Nal-IRI/FL demonstrated comparable efficacy, with a median OS of 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.5-7.3) for FOLFOX and 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.6-6.9) for Nal-IRI/FL, and no significant differences were observed across subgroups. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and biliary events were less frequent with FOLFOX, which also showed a lower incidence of adverse events and higher relative dose intensity than Nal-IRI/FL or FOLFIRINOX. In patients with advanced BTC who failed GP treatment, the FOLFOX regimen demonstrated comparable efficacy, and a more favorable safety profile compared to other 5-FU-based treatments. Given its favorable toxicity profile in a real-world setting, FOLFOX should be considered a standard second-line treatment option.",

  "abstract": "HIV/AIDS remains a major public health concern in Vietnam. While advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have significantly enhanced survival rates and transformed HIV into a manageable chronic condition, the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) often falls short of optimal levels. This study aims to evaluate the HRQL of HIV/AIDS outpatients at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam and identify key factors impacting their well-being. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 328 PLHA receiving care at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases between March 2023 to March 2024. Data was collected using the World Health Organization Quality of Life-HIV Brief Version (WHOQOL-HIV BREF) instrument and included socio-demographic, clinical, and treatment-related variables. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize the data. Inferential statistical analyses, including independent  -test, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and linear regression, were performed to evaluate the relationships between HRQL domains and participant characteristics. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The mean overall quality of life score was 14.6 ± 2.2. The highest domain scores were observed in spirituality (15.1 ± 3.5) and environment (15.1 ± 2.9), while the lowest was in the physical domain (14.1 ± 2.0). Significant determinants of overall quality of life included age, marital status, employment type, income, financial difficulties, chronic diseases, and CD4 counts (all p < 0.05). This study highlights the multifaceted challenges affecting the quality of life of PLHA, emphasizing the need for a holistic care approach. Being married, having stable employment, and having higher CD4 counts were associated with better quality of life, whereas older age, unstable income, financial struggles, and comorbidities were linked to poorer outcomes. Interventions addressing these determinants, including chronic disease management, social and mental health support are crucial for enhancing overall well-being.",

However, the mechanisms underlying primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the biomarkers associated with primary resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs was defined as disease progression within 90 days (3 months) of treatment in patients with EGFR-sensitive mutant adenocarcinoma without any evidence of objective response. Retrospective, single-center study. This study retrospectively screened patients with NSCLC who received EGFR-TKIs at Hunan Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. According to pre-determined clinical outcomes, we divided the patients into primary resistance and sensitivity groups. Only patients with sufficient samples that passed quality control were included in this study. Tumor tissue and paired peripheral blood samples collected from patients before treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing using an 825-gene panel. In addition, tumor tissue samples were analyzed for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this study, with 35 in each of the primary resistant and sensitive groups. Patients with exon 4 mutations in the   gene had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those without the mutation.   and   mutation frequencies were substantially higher in the primary resistant group and were associated with shorter PFS and OS. Furthermore, patients in the primary resistant group exhibited substantially higher levels of PD-L1 expression. The potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs are highly heterogeneous. Combining some somatic variants affecting tumor function and high PD-L1 expression may contribute to this resistance.",

Despite their high frequency, there is still no consensus about treatment options. All PFCL grades can be treated with surgery, nonoperative treatment, or both. The purpose of this study was to compare patients with PFCLs who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy surgery followed by physical therapy and rehabilitation with those patients who only received physical therapy and rehabilitation. It was hypothesized that patients who underwent unilateral Fulkerson osteotomy surgery would have superior results compared with patients who only received nonoperative treatment. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. This was a prospective study with a case-control design and included 20 patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy and 20 patients with PFCL who were managed nonoperatively. The follow-up period was a median of 13.25 months (range, 12.03-14.71 months) for patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy and 12.85 months (range, 12-14.37 months) for patients who were treated nonoperatively. Knee joint position sense and gait kinematics were assessed using the DrGoniometer Application and Zebris FDM-T device. The functional level was determined using the single-leg hop test, the single-leg squat test, and the Kujala subjective knee evaluation form. When comparing gait kinematics of the affected sides between patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy and those who received nonoperative treatment (physical therapy and rehabilitation only), differences were observed in step length, cadence, stance phase percentage, and swing phase percentage (  < .05). In knee joint position sense of the affected sides at 60° target angle, patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy had significant improvements after surgery (  < .05), whereas patients who were managed nonoperatively showed continued impairment both before and after treatment (  < .05). No significant differences were observed in single-leg hop and single-leg squat test results between the 2 groups (  > .05). Kujala scores were significantly higher in the Fulkerson osteotomy group (89.79 ± 12.67 vs 80.10 ± 13.20, respectively) (  < .05). Patients who underwent Fulkerson osteotomy had superior gait kinematics, joint position sense at 60° of flexion, and Kujala scores. No significant changes were observed in terms of the joint position sense at 15°, 45°, and 90° of flexion, the single-leg hop test, and the single-leg squat test compared with those who received nonoperative treatment.",

Five postmenopausal women were treated with estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT) which included TDE  and progestin formulation for MHT. The progestin formulation was replaced with BZA, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, due to unscheduled uterine bleeding. Four of five postmenopausal women were evaluated in terms of estrogen dynamics and recurrence of climacteric symptoms. In all cases examined in this report, unscheduled uterine bleeding resolved within one month. In two of four patients in whom climacteric symptoms recurred, their serum estradiol levels were surprisingly elevated three months after the start of TDE /BZA. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the successful treatment of unscheduled uterine bleeding by TDE /BZA during MHT and a suggested correlation between estrogen dynamics and concomitant recurrence of side effects caused by TDE /BZA.",

We describe a case of HCQ-induced hepatic failure in a 31-year-old female patient on HCQ for systemic lupus erythematous who presented with three days of fever, diarrhea, and non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. Labs showed massively elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and negative viral serology. The abdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were unremarkable. A liver biopsy showed portal tracts with mild to moderate expansion by mixed inflammatory infiltrates, including scattered eosinophils and rare plasma cells with occasional mild interface activity focally close to bridging inflammation.

Overall, 112 patients were included, with 84 receiving RT and 28 FT as primary treatment. Median age and PSA were 68 years and 5.4 ng/mL, respectively. There was one rectal injury in the RT group. The overall 90-day complications were significantly higher in RT group (33% vs. 11%,   = 0.03). On multivariable analysis, history of RT and prolonged operative time were associated with a higher rate of 90-day complications. The 6- and 12-month continence rates were higher in FT group (50% vs. 20%,   = 0.02 and 69% vs. 33%,   = 0.03). Potency at 12 months was better preserved in FT group (46% vs. 12%,   = 0.01). On final sRRP pathology, the rates of grade group ≥ 4 (51% vs. 36%,   = 0.2), pT3 (69% vs. 75%,   = 0.6), positive nodes (30% vs. 18%,   = 0.2) and positive margins (33% vs. 39%,   = 0.5) were similar for RT versus FT, respectively. The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 86% for RT versus 94% for FT (  = 0.6).  sRRP for recurrent PCa after FT is associated with lower complications and higher urinary continence and potency rates than patients who received primary RT.",

  "abstract": "Introduction Elbow stiffness can be disabling when performing activities. Surgery is indicated when conservative treatment fails. In older patients, the most appropriate surgical option is total elbow arthroplasty. However, in younger patients, the choice of surgery remains a topic of discussion. Materials and methods This study was a retrospective case series with a five-year follow-up, evaluating the outcomes of interpositional arthroplasty with dermal grafting and a hinged external fixator for elbow osteoarthrosis associated with stiffness in young adults according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), the quickDASH score, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and range of motion (ROM). Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months postoperatively. Imaging evaluations were performed preoperatively and at the 60-month follow-up. All complications were documented. Results We evaluated 40 patients. The MEPS increased from 42.6 ± 12.2 to 70.3 ± 18.6 (p < 0.001). The quickDASH score decreased from 43.4 ± 3.2 to 25.3 ± 9.7 (p < 0.001), and the VAS score decreased from 8.7 ± 2.0 to 3.7 ± 2.7 at the end of follow-up (p < 0.001). The flexion-extension arc increased from 49˚ ± 27˚ to 92˚ ± 29˚ (p < 0.001). Imaging studies showed a reduction in joint narrowing, a decrease in osteophytes, a higher radiographic classification of arthrosis, and fewer loose bodies. A total of 65% of patients experienced transient complications, while 5% had complications requiring reoperation, including arthrodesis and total elbow arthroplasty. Conclusions Interpositional arthroplasty with dermal grafting and a hinged external fixator for elbow osteoarthrosis associated with stiffness in young adults significantly improves clinical functional scale scores, ROM, and radiological appearance at the five-year follow-up. Despite the high rate of complications, most were transient and manageable, with only a small percentage of cases (5%) requiring surgical reintervention. The procedure demonstrated sustained functional benefits over time, with early improvements in pain and mobility stabilizing in the long term.",

  "abstract": "The traditional classification and risk stratification systems of endometrial cancer (EC), which relied on histomorphological features, were limited and poor reproducible. The classification of new molecular subtypes of EC has been developing, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-four molecular subtypes: Polymerase epsilon (POLE) mutation (POLEmut), microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy number-low, and copy number-high and ProMisE-four molecular subtypes: POLEmut, mismatch repair deficiency, no specific molecular profile, and p53 abnormal. POLEmut usually correlates with a favorable outcome. Hence, we reviewed the research since the TCGA molecular subtypes developed in 2013 and summarized the characteristics and prognosis of POLEmut EC patients. In summary, we found POLEmut occurs in 7.3%-9.6% of EC in the previous studies. POLEmut EC consistently exhibits favorable patient outcomes, regardless of adjuvant therapy. The research of POLEmut in EC is absent in Taiwan, and the underlying mechanisms and cost-effectiveness need further investigation.",

  "abstract": "Digital ulcers (DUs) are a major cause of pain and disability in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and remain a major treatment challenge. Our aim was to explore clinicians' perspectives towards treatment initiation and escalation, akin to a 'Treat to Target' (T2T) strategy. SSc clinicians were invited to participate in an online survey. A total of 173 responses (75% rheumatologists) were obtained from 33 countries. When initiating a change in oral drug therapy for SSc-DUs, most (80%) respondents would consider adding new medication to existing treatment, and 50% would increase existing treatment dose. Time to assess the impact of treatment change varied considerably, with around half (43.6%) waiting 1 month. Endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors and prostanoids were considered most efficacious for DU prevention, with good perceived efficacy from calcium channel blockers and moderate benefit from anti-platelet agents and immunosuppression. Side effects (e.g. headache and peripheral oedema) are perceived to be a significant issue with oral vasodilatory/vasoactive therapies in many patients. The highest rated T2T targets were (1) complete absence of new/recurrent DUs (63%), (2) reduction >50% in the number of DU recurrence (52%) and (3) reduction in DU healing time (37%) and reduction in DU pain >50% (37%). The most frequent reasons for hospitalisation were to administer intravenous treatment (91%) and DU complications (87%). Surgery is reserved for the threatened digit (e.g. gangrene), underlying calcinosis and failure of medical therapy. Significant heterogeneity currently exists concerning treatment initiation and escalation for SSc-DUs, potentially amenable to a T2T strategy.",

  "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare but serious complication that poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article presents three cases of leptomeningeal involvement in patients with MM, highlighting the diverse clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies employed. The first case is a 54-year-old female who, after initial treatment and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, developed CNS disease. Similarly, a 73-year-old female developed leptomeningeal involvement with progressive neurological symptoms. The third case describes a 63-year-old female with immunoglobulin (Ig)A lambda MM who developed CNS disease after treatment with daratumumab and radiation. In all three cases, leptomeningeal enhancement and atypical plasma cells were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with treatment strategies including intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiation, and stem cell transplantation. Despite aggressive management, including novel agents and supportive care, all patients had poor outcomes, with two transitioning to hospice care. The article reviews the limited literature on CNS-MM, noting the lack of standardized treatment protocols and the need for further research. As the survival of MM patients improves, the incidence of CNS involvement is expected to rise, making the development of targeted therapies essential. These cases underscore the urgent need for further investigation into novel treatment options and the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management of CNS-MM.",

  "abstract": "Paralysis of the serratus anterior (SA) is most frequently caused by dysfunction of the long thoracic nerve (LTN). Although this condition presents with classic physical examination findings, it is occasionally missed. The purpose of this study is to review the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment options for SA palsy. This study summarizes the anatomy of the SA and LTN, most common causes of SA palsy, physical examination findings, utility of diagnostic tests, the natural history of this condition, and all treatment options that can be contemplated. SA palsy should be suspected in patients with weak forward flexion and abnormal prominence of the medial edge of the scapula with weakness in shoulder protraction. The diagnosis can be confirmed with electromyography and nerve conduction studies. Magnetic resonance may show neurogenic fatty infiltration or atrophy. Although most patients benefit from conservative treatment (mostly physical therapy) for the first 12 months, many patients experience persistent weakness with various degrees of severity. For patients with disabling symptoms, nerve release or transfers have been reported to lead to SA reinnervation with functional improvements. However, long-standing palsy is best managed with a split pectoralis major transfer of the sternal head to the inferior pole of the scapula. Scapulothoracic arthrodesis is an uncommon procedure for patients in whom a previous tendon transfer has failed. LTN dysfunction leading to SA palsy can be typically diagnosed with certain physical examination findings and confirmed using electromyogram with nerve conduction studies. Although spontaneous recovery can occur, patients with persistent serratus weakness may be considered for neurolysis, nerve transfer, or tendon transfer. Currently, direct transfer of the sternal head of the pectoralis major to the inferior pole of the scapula is our management of choice for patients with disabling symptoms and no improvement despite a good program of physical therapy.",

Cordocentesis revealed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and low levels of free thyroxine 4 (fT4), which was the basis of diagnosis of fetal hypothyroidism. Intra-amniotic injections of levothyroxine were administered, resulting in a reduction in the goiter size, amount of amniotic fluid, and level of maternal TSH. The mother was euthyroid during pregnancy. The infant was delivered vaginally at full term with a normal thyroid size and no respiratory disorders except hypothyroidism.

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pancytopenia is an exceedingly rare adverse effect of antithyroid medications. It can be associated with both propylthiouracil and methimazole. While agranulocytosis is a more common adverse effect, pancytopenia has unique diagnostic and management issues due to its potential severity. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 36-year-old woman who presented to the Emergency Department with pancytopenia 2 months after starting methimazole for Grave's disease. Her case was complicated by severe candidemia and Serratia bacteremia. Laboratory workup revealed positive cytoplasmic and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) on immunofluorescence testing, with negative results on ELISA for MPO and PR3 antibodies. These findings were attributed to methimazole-induced ANCA positivity rather than primary ANCA-associated vasculitis. Methimazole was discontinued, and the patient was managed with aggressive antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, including blood transfusions and antifungal treatment. Despite the complexity of her condition, she survived after several months of intensive care and showed gradual improvement in blood counts and overall clinical status. CONCLUSIONS This case underscores the importance of recognizing potential iatrogenic causes of pancytopenia in patients receiving antithyroid medications. Early identification, prompt discontinuation of the offending agent, and comprehensive supportive care are essential for positive outcomes. This case also highlights the necessity for vigilant monitoring, patient education, and regular follow-up in individuals on antithyroid medications to prevent severe complications, morbidity, and mortality associated with rare but serious adverse effects like pancytopenia.",

An example of a chemotherapeutic drug class that has been well documented over the years to cause CCMP is anthracyclines. To date, few studies have been carried out in Saudi Arabia on the prevalence of CCMP and the associated risk factors. Therefore, the objective of our research is to measure the prevalence and determine the risk factors of such phenomena. This is a comparative cross-sectional study. Data from 114 patients was retrieved from the medical records of the cardiac department at Princess Noorah Oncology Center, King Abdulaziz Medical City. The research included pediatric oncology patients aged 14 or under who were treated with anthracyclines from June 2016 to May 2024. We excluded patients who did not undergo ECHO. A consecutive sampling technique was used to collect the patients. Over the eight-year study period, we found that 7.34% (8/109) of the cohort developed CCMP, with a mean age at diagnosis of 6.39 ± 3.81 years. The mean dose of anthracycline received until the diagnosis of CCMP was 194.77±145.92 mg, with a median interval between anthracycline initiation and CCMP diagnosis of 13.65 (3-89) weeks. A significant association was found between thromboembolism, PDA, type of cancer, and the development of CCMP. We found that traditional predictors such as gender, age at diagnosis, and cumulative anthracycline dose were not predictors of CCMP.",

  "abstract": "Geriatric pelvic and acetabular fractures pose significant challenges due to patient frailty, comorbidities, and the complexity of fracture patterns. This review examines current evidence and evolving strategies for managing these injuries. Treatment approaches range from nonoperative management to surgical interventions, including percutaneous fixation, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and total hip arthroplasty, either as a standalone procedure or combined with ORIF. Decision making is guided by fracture morphology, patient functionality, and physiological reserve to optimize clinical outcomes. Minimally invasive techniques, particularly for fragility fractures of the pelvis, have gained traction because of their ability to provide stable fixation while minimizing surgical morbidity. The importance of early mobilization and a multidisciplinary perioperative approach is highlighted as essential in reducing complications and improving recovery. Despite advancements, controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment of complex acetabular fractures in elderly patients. This review synthesizes the latest evidence and expert perspectives to aid clinicians in selecting the most appropriate management strategies, with the goal of restoring mobility, minimizing complications, and enhancing the quality of life in this vulnerable population.",

  "abstract": "cancer ranks as the second leading cause of mortality worldwide, manifesting in diverse forms and impacting various tissues, notably prostate cancer (PCa) in men and breast cancer (BCa) in women. Cancer is a malignant tumor that can induce an immune response. During this reaction, immune cells are produced which are responsible for ridding the body of senescent and/or tumor cells, and constitute tumor effectors. Studies have shown that the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a good prognostic marker for assessing survival in cancer patients; however, no similar data have yet been published in Cameroon. the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between TILs and the survival of breast and prostate cancer patients at Yaoundé General Hospital (YGH) between 2019 and 2023. For this, a retrospective and cross-sectional study was undertaken at the Oncology Department and the Anatomo-Cytopathology Laboratory of YGH. A consecutive non-probability sampling (from August to October 2023) of 212 breast cancer patients and 89 prostate cancer patients who agreed to participate in the study constituted our sample. Variables were survival, TILs, sociodemographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics of patients. The TILs were estimated after Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and staged as low, middle and high TILs rate. The variables were sociodemographic characteristics (age, education level, religion, marital status, ethnolinguistic area, and menopause); clinical characteristics (affected breast, histological type, histological grade, type of treatment, AJCC stage, consistency of discovery); different grades of TILs. Furthermore, the correlation between TILs and chemotherapy as well as TILs and survival were analyzed. The obtained data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel, Epi-info 7 and SPSS software and statistical significance was considered at p< 0.05. Furthermore, the Cox regression analysis to identify factors associated with survival was performed. the mean age was 43.56 ± 11.90 years for BCa with stage II and SBR grade II being the most common with proportions of 48.34% and 54.72%, respectively (n= 212). While in PCa, the mean age was 75 to 84 years (34.83%, n= 89) with stage II being the most frequent. Microscopic analysis of breast tissues revealed four TILs grades: absent (17.45%), low (18.40%), intermediate (27.83%) and high TIL grade (36.32%), while in PCa the most represented TILs grade was intermediate (31.46%). In BCa the intermediate TILs grade was positively associated with a good response to chemotherapy (p< 0.05). The overall 5-year survival in this study was around 44% for BCa, whereas it was 42 months for those with infiltration in PCa. No positive correlation was found between TILs grade and survival in BCa patients (p= 0.45), while in PCa, it was found that TILs are significantly correlated (p =0.016) with survival. Patients with prostate cancer who had not taken treatment had a 7.23 greater risk of death (HR: 7.23, 95% CI 1.21-53.14; p= 0.049) than those who had. no positive association was observed between TILs as graded and 5-year survival in BCa patients; however, it may have prognostic value in PCa patients. Further studies are encouraged to investigate the association between BCa molecular groups and TILs.",

These topics include staged treatment strategies, surgical planning, fracture classification, and factors influencing weight bearing. A staged protocol for treating high-energy fractures of the proximal tibia using spanning external fixation with quadrangular configuration is a simple and reproducible way to apply the device and reduce and span these fractures. Multicolumnar fractures can behave differently based on their categorization using the main deformity direction concept, defined as a theoretical vector representing the global displacement or deformity of the columns in a specific direction, and this can help surgeons decide on the definitive treatment. With the classification of columnar involvement and their variants, surgeons can use computed tomography scans to formulate solutions to approach and fix individual fracture patterns. Finally, a finite element analysis may inform the surgeon's decision for immediate weight bearing of a split plateau fracture after fixation with locking screw plates or cannulated screws.",

  "abstract": "Fetal bladder rupture is rare and mainly caused by lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO). Our case report describes a rupture at a gestational age of 31 weeks following high-dose maternal opioid exposure during intensive care treatment. Opioids perturb the interplay of afferent and efferent signals between the bladder, urethra, and the central nervous system (CNS) which is crucial in contributing to urinary retention. They rapidly cross the human placenta, affecting also the fetus. To date, there is no clear proof of the connection between maternal opioid treatment and fetal bladder rupture, but the association seems to strengthen. A 18-year old first Gravida at 31 weeks of gestation developed a severe sepsis with progressive hypoxic lung failure and need for intubation. During the ICU-treatment, several opioids were administered for sedation and pain relief. Four days after induction of opioid treatment the ultrasound revealed a decompressed fetal bladder, hematoma and significant ascites. Fetal bladder rupture with urinary ascites was suspected. A caesarean section was performed at 33 weeks of gestation due to massive fetal urinary ascites, fetal deterioration and imminent abdominal compartment syndrome. Adequate ventilation and circulation could only be established after percutaneous drainage of 350 mL of abdominal fluid, that was confirmed to be urine. A defect of the bladder was confirmed by ultrasound. On the fifth day of life, the bladder was closed surgically by pediatric surgery. Growing awareness of the possible connection between maternal opioid therapy and fetal bladder rupture is necessary to plan follow-up ultrasound examinations to assess the fetal situation.",

Monitoring of serum drug and anti-drug antibody levels is essential for managing patients with treatment failure. A Reporter Gene Assay (RGA), previously developed for infliximab, was validated for the measurement of biosimilars infliximab-dyyb and infliximab-abda, and detection of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA). 65 de-identified residual samples from patients receiving infliximab or its biosimilars, were tested. ELISA and cell-based Reporter Gene Assay (RGA) were performed to measure drug while a bridging ELISA and a modified RGA assay were performed to detect ADA. Analysis of assay analytical parameters showed acceptable linearity (systematic error < 15 %), recovery (82-119 %), precision and reproducibility (coefficient of variation < 15 %) of the RGA assay for measuring biosimilars. Detection of ADA developed against infliximab or biosimilars showed a complete agreement (Cohen's k = 1; 95 % CI = 1.0 to 1.0) between the RGA assays using infliximab, versus infliximab-dyyb, or infliximab-abda as assay reagents. A functional cell-based reporter gene assay was validated for measuring serum concentrations of infliximab biosimilars and neutralizing antibodies. This study supports the bio- equivalency and cross-immunogenicity of parent drug and biosimilars and offers guidance for management of patients switching therapies between parent drug and biosimilars.",

  "abstract": "Study DesignModified Delphi study.ObjectivesTelementoring, the practice of providing remote guidance and teaching from a distance using telecommunication technology, has demonstrated feasibility and value in assisting surgeons in remote locations. However, limited evidence exists regarding its effectiveness in improving surgeon performance. This study aimed to develop metrics to assess spine surgeon performance in scoliosis surgery, potentially within the context of a telementoring training program.MethodsTen expert spine surgeons participated in a four-round modified Delphi process including both online and in-person meetings. The resulting metrics were validated for objective assessment by eleven surgeons, who reviewed and rated a video recording using the established rubric.ResultsThe final set of metrics, comprising 50 procedural steps and 28 error categories, was unanimously approved by the panel. Additionally, the panel agreed that utilizing cameras, smart lenses, and output from intraoperative imaging monitors would provide sufficient visibility for assessing both steps and errors.ConclusionsA set of assessment metrics for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery was successfully defined and validated by reviewing example videos. The longer-term research objective is to employ this rubric to assess surgeon's performance throughout a telementoring program, thus assessing its educational impact. The rubric could also be used in other contexts, such as live surgical observation.",

  "abstract": "Sepsis is a serious systemic inflammatory condition triggered by a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and viruses, that can result in multiple organ failure and a life-threatening situation. Despite advances in medical care, the mortality rate for sepsis remains high even with aggressive treatment strategies such as antibiotic therapy, fluid resuscitation, and respiratory and circulatory support. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), as a novel nanoscale biocarrier, exhibit diverse biological functions including immune modulation and tissue regeneration, suggesting promising applications in the field. This article provides an overview of the diverse therapeutic effects of EVs derived from various sources in the management of sepsis. Furthermore, EVs not only possess intrinsic therapeutic properties, such as immune modulation, but also function as targeted delivery vehicles for a variety of drug molecules, leading to synergistic therapeutic outcomes. In conclusion, extracellular vesicle therapy is poised to emerge as a dynamic and innovative force driving advancements in sepsis treatment.",

This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiome and metabolome in SLE and evaluate the therapeutic potential of specific microbial supplementation in MRL/lpr mice. MRL/lpr mice, a well-established model for SLE, were used to analyze gut microbiome changes before and after SLE symptom onset. 16S rRNA sequencing and GC-MS-based metabolic profiling were performed to identify key microbial species and associated metabolites. Selected microbes were supplemented in MRL/lpr mice for 10 weeks, and their effects on SLE symptoms and Th17/Treg balance were evaluated. Eisenbergiella massiliensis, Lacrimispora saccharolytica, and Hungatella xylanolytica were significantly decreased in MRL/lpr mice following the onset of SLE symptoms. These microbes were strongly correlated with specific metabolites, including 5-cholestanol, cholesterol, p-cresol, and indole. Supplementation with these microbes alleviated SLE symptoms and modulated the Th17/Treg balance. This study highlights the critical role of gut microbiota in immune regulation and SLE symptom relief. Targeted microbial supplementation may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for managing SLE.",

Since repeated mobilization is known to be valuable in non-surgical OI conditions, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of an early standardized repeated mobilization procedure as treatment of postoperative OI after THA. This study was a single-arm, two-center hypothesis-generating feasibility study in patients undergoing THA. At first mobilization 4 h after surgery patients were categorized as having orthostatic tolerance (OT) or OI. Patients with OI underwent an hourly standardized repeated mobilization procedure until achieving OT or reaching 8 h post-surgery. Of 84 patients screened for OI, 25 (30 %) had OI 4 h postoperatively. Four patients left the study before achieving OT. Of the 21 completing the study per protocol, 16 patients achieved OT at 5 h and the remaining 5 achieved OT at 6 h postoperatively.

  "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of relative change in E2 levels during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) on embryo development and pregnancy outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART). We retrospectively analyzed 9,376 patients who underwent their first fresh ART cycle from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2022. Patients were classified into four groups based on relative change in E2 levels: low response group, moderate response group, moderate-high response group, and high response group. The primary outcomes were blastocyst formation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and live birth rate, while secondary outcomes included miscarriage rate and ectopic pregnancy rate. Most cycles (96.5%) demonstrated an increase in E2 levels during COS. The blastocyst formation rate significantly increased across the groups (low response group: 0.13, moderate response group: 0.21, moderate-high response group: 0.28, high response group: 0.34; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression showed significantly higher blastocyst formation rates in the moderate response group (adjusted OR = 2.012, 95% CI: 1.687-2.399), moderate-high response group (adjusted OR = 4.613, 95% CI: 3.853-5.523), and high response group (adjusted OR = 11.295, 95% CI: 9.192-13.880) compared to the low response group.

  "abstract": "Multiple rare diagnoses in the neuroinflammatory disease spectrum are associated with a high morbidity and mortality and are refractory to systemic immunotherapies. Owing to disease rarity, there are often barriers or delays in introducing novel treatment protocols. The development of institutional treatment protocols helps to ensure consistent and improved efficiency to help ensure optimal patient outcomes. A multidisciplinary team with aligned interests was created and aided in identifying the need for a new treatment regimen for patients with treatment refractory neuroinflammatory disease. This work group was convened to determine a standardized template for the management of patients requiring intrathecal therapy. After review and assessment of existing clinical case reports, and other supporting documents, the workgroup reached a consensus regarding optimal treatment approaches, created methods for distribution, and education of providers to utilize the developed clinical template. We document our process for creating and implementing a treatment protocol for intrathecal (IT) dexamethasone in children with treatment-refractory neuroinflammatory disease. The treatment protocol was approved by key stakeholders across multiple disciplines as part of a collaborative effort to improve outcomes. We describe eight patients with neuroinflammatory disease treated with IT dexamethasone without adverse events. There are many barriers in the introduction of novel treatment protocols in rare disease. Utilization of a multidisciplinary team can help identify barriers and facilitate protocol development, leading to alternative treatment pathways in those with rare disease. The development of a standardized treatment approach can be an important way to ensure adequate and effective treatment of patients with rare disorders. The implementation process requires institutions to dedicate resources to ensure key stakeholder input to address barriers to implementation, and to provide ongoing input following implementation to assess patient outcomes.",

The cumulative incidence of CS-HCMV-i at 100 and 180 days from transplant was 3.8% and 16%, respectively, in patients who received LET-PP, and 14% and 17% in patients who did not. Variables associated with increased risk of CS-HCMV-i in patients who received LET-PP included transplant from an HCMV-seronegative donor, transplant from a donor other than matched related, >20 days to engraftment, and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transplant in HCMV-seropositive recipients was associated with increased risk of CS-HCMV-i in patients who did not receive LET-PP. One-year overall survival after transplant was 81.1%. Acute leukemia, disease not in remission at transplant, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >1, >20 days to engraftment, acute GVHD, CS Epstein-Barr virus DNAemia, gram-negative bacteremia, and invasive fungal disease were associated with increased mortality in patients who received LET-PP.

  "abstract": "Good sleep quality is crucial for health and body equilibrium, particularly during pregnancy, where changes in sleep are influenced by mechanical and hormonal factors. Poor sleep can hinder daily activities and lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data on sleep quality are scarce in low and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to determine the magnitude of sleep quality and its associated factors among pregnant mothers in Bahir Dar City, northwest Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 367 randomly selected pregnant women. All pregnant women who attended public health facilities in Bahir Dar City from November 1st to December 30, 2022 were included except who were critically ill and aged less than 18 years. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews. Sleep quality was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Stata v14 was used for data analysis. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with poor sleep quality. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 55.04%. In the multivariable analysis, older maternal age (AOR = 3.62), third trimester (AOR = 2.83), multigravidas (AOR = 2.55), low hemoglobin (AOR = 1.92), and coffee consumption (AOR = 2.19) were associated with poor sleep quality. More than half of pregnant women had poor sleep quality. Women aged ≥ 30 years, 3rd trimester, multigravidas, anemic women, and coffee consumption during pregnancy were factors associated with poor sleep quality. The concerned body should pay attention to improving Hgb level and iron/folate supplementation and reduce coffee intake in pregnant women to improve maternal sleep quality during pregnancy.",

  "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRDs) are a group of diseases responsible for inflammatory joint pains and can affect young women with a desire to conceive. CIRDs can impact female fertility, although the exact effects are still not fully understood. Some studies report reduced fertility, particularly due to prolonged conception delays, which are related to multiple factors. Among these, sexual dysfunction is common due to pain and chronic fatigue. The impact of CIRDs on ovarian reserve remains controversial. Regarding treatments, disease-modifying drugs have not shown a deleterious effect on fertility, but certain teratogenic treatments should be avoided in women who wish to conceive. Furthermore, there appears to be an association between CIRDs and some gynecological conditions known causes of infertility. For patients with CIRDs, early discussion about fertility is necessary. In the case of a desire for pregnancy, preconception consultation is essential to adjust treatments, manage risks, and prepare for pregnancy under the best possible conditions. In cases of proven infertility, assisted reproductive technology is a therapeutic option. Some studies suggest that success rates may be lower than those observed in the general population. A multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, gynecologists, and reproductive specialists, as well as therapeutic optimization during the preconception period, is crucial to improve the chances of conception and provide appropriate follow-up for these patients.",

  "abstract": "Amygdala hyperreactivity early-post trauma has been a demonstrable neurobiological correlate of future posttraumautic stress disorder (PTSD). The basolateral amygdala (BLA) particularly is vital for fear memory and threat processing, but BLA functional dynamics following a traumatic event are unexplored. BLA reactivity to threat may be a trait that can predict PTSD and persist over time. Alternatively, BLA responsivity to threat cues may change over time and be related to PTSD severity. As part of a larger, multisite study, AURORA, participants 18-75 years old were enrolled in an emergency department (ED) within 72 h of a traumatic event (N = 304, 199 female). At 2-weeks and 6-months post-trauma, PTSD symptoms, BLA responses to threat (fearful>neutral faces), and functional connectivity (FC) during fMRI were assessed. Generalizability of findings was assessed in an external replication sample of ED patients (n = 33). Two weeks post-trauma right BLA reactivity positively predicted later PTSD severity. However, left BLA reactivity to threat at 6 months post-trauma was negatively associated with PTSD severity at that timepoint (ΔPseudo-R  = 0.04, IRR = 0.38, p < 0.001). In addition, a decrease in BLA reactivity from 2-weeks to 6-months predicted greater PTSD severity at 6 months (ΔPseudo-R  = 0.03, IRR = 0.58, p < 0.001). This replicated in the external sample. A reduction in left BLA FC with the dorsal attention network predicted increased PTSD severity over time. These findings support a shift in BLA function within the first 6 months post-trauma that predicts PTSD pathology and stand in contrast to prior conceptualizations of amygdala hyperreactivity as a trait-like PTSD risk factor.",

  "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), a degenerative joint disease driven by biomechanical instability, involves cartilage degradation, muscle dysfunction, and MLK3/P38 MAPK pathway activation. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), a regulator of chondrocyte and muscle homeostasis, interacts with this pathway during disease progression. While Hyriopsis Bioactive Polysaccharide-Anodonta (HBP-A) exhibits P38 MAPK inhibitory properties in vitro, its in vivo therapeutic effects on musculoskeletal tissues remain uncharacterised. A destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) mouse model was established to investigate HBP-A's therapeutic potential. Animals were randomly divided into sham-operated, DMM-induced, and HBP-A-treated groups. Following surgical induction, HBP-A (0.26 g/kg) was administered daily via oral gavage for 4 weeks. Comprehensive assessments included behavioural tests for pain sensitivity, micro-CT scanning, histological evaluation, and transmission electron microscope. Molecular mechanisms were investigated via immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining of MLK3, P38 MAPK, Caspase-3, and HDAC4, complemented by RT-qPCR analysis of myokine expression. HBP-A treatment significantly alleviated pain sensitivity compared to the DMM group. Structural evaluations revealed preserved subchondral bone integrity and attenuated cartilage degeneration, with histological scoring confirming reduced pathological changes. Quadriceps exhibited mitigated atrophy and restored ultrastructural organisation. Molecular profiling demonstrated suppressed MLK3/P38 MAPK pathway activation, diminished apoptotic activity, and elevated HDAC4 expression in both cartilage and quadriceps. HBP-A additionally normalised dysregulated expression of muscle-derived osteogenic factors linked to bone-cartilage crosstalk. These findings establish HBP-A as a dual-target therapeutic agent for KOA, concurrently mitigating cartilage and muscle degeneration through MLK3/P38 MAPK/HDAC4 axis modulation.",

  "abstract": "Worldwide, ischemic heart disease is less prevalent in women than in men, but this gap has narrowed in recent decades. This study aims to evaluate trends and gender differences in the global burden of ischemic heart disease (IHD) across demographics and regions from 1990 to 2021. We utilized the data of the Global Burden of Disease Study from 1990 to 2021. The standard epidemiological measurements, including incidence, prevalence, mortality rates, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), were obtained to estimate the burden of IHD concerning age, sex, and the sociodemographic index, allowing for comparisons over time. The sex parity ratio (SPR), defined as the ratio of females to males, has increased globally. The SPR of age-standardized prevalence (ASPR) and age-standardized incidence (ASIR) rose from 0.610 to 0.631 in 1990 to 0.653 and 0.670 in 2021, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, the SPRs for ASPR and ASIR of IHD increased across all age groups. However, the SPRs for the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and the age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) of IHD declined. This decrease in the SPR for both ASMR and ASDR of IHD was observed in most regions of this study. While progress has been made in reducing the burden of IHD, the increasing sex disparities in specific regions and age groups emphasize the need for continuous monitoring, adaptive health policies, and sex-specific healthcare practices to ensure equitable health outcomes for all populations. not applicable.",

  "abstract": "Advanced care planning (ACP) and advance medical directives (AMDs) are vital for aligning medical decisions with patient preferences, particularly for end-of-life care. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment in India established the legality of AMDs, enabling patients to exercise their autonomy. Recent amendments in 2023 simplified procedural requirements, replacing judicial magistrate approval with a streamlined two-tier medical board system. This article proposes a culturally sensitive and practical 12-step framework for implementing ACP and AMDs in India. A structured and consensus-driven process was undertaken by experts in palliative medicine, neurology, critical care, and geriatrics, supported by key medical organizations. The development process included multiple iterations, public consultations, and feedback from legal and medical stakeholders. The framework integrates legal, ethical, and cultural considerations to address procedural and systemic challenges in ACP implementation. The proposed 12-step pathway focuses on three phases: creating living wills, periodic reviews and updates, and executing AMDs. Key components include initiating discussions, identification and appointment of surrogate decision-makers, ensuring legal compliance through simplified procedures, and providing guidance for withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments. Implementation strategies emphasize public awareness, provider training, and institutional policies to normalize ACP. Simplified legal requirements introduced in 2023 facilitate broader adoption and reduce procedural barriers. This framework provides a practical, culturally relevant model for ACP in India, ensuring patient-centered, ethical, and transparent end-of-life care. By integrating simplified legal procedures and addressing misconceptions through education and policy initiatives, the proposed approach empowers individuals, families, and healthcare providers to make informed decisions, fostering dignity and autonomy in medical care.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer effective therapy without injections or blood monitoring. This bibliometric analysis explores the research on NOACs for preventing VTE and pulmonary embolism. Literature up to July 20, 2024, was searched in Web of Science Core Collection. Citespace software was used for screening and analysis. In this study, we analyzed 2124 articles and 767 reviews from 11,282 institutions across 528 countries and regions, encompassing 830 publications and 60 research directions. The USA led in publication count, followed by Germany and Canada. Cardiovascular System Cardiology, Hematology, and General Internal Medicine were the top research areas, while THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS was the leading journal. From 2004 to 2024, we observed accelerated publication growth, particularly from 2008, highlighting the emergence of NOACs as a major research focus. Key contributors, including Bengt I. Eriksson, and major institutions like Harvard Medical School and University of Amsterdam, played pivotal roles in advancing anticoagulant research. Co-citation and keyword clustering analyses revealed research hotspots in NOACs, cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention, and COVID-19-related thrombotic events, reflecting a shift towards individualized anticoagulation therapy and the growing importance of NOACs in various clinical contexts. The development of NOACs has progressed rapidly, with an increasing number of publications, indicating the lead research in the United States and other Western nations. Comparative studies on the safety and efficacy of NOACs have become a significant focus, shifting from traditional anticoagulants. Pharmacogenetics-guided use of NOACS shows new hope of precision medicine.",

  "abstract": "Geriatric pelvic and acetabular fractures pose significant challenges due to patient frailty, comorbidities, and the complexity of fracture patterns. This review examines current evidence and evolving strategies for managing these injuries. Treatment approaches range from nonoperative management to surgical interventions, including percutaneous fixation, open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), and total hip arthroplasty, either as a standalone procedure or combined with ORIF. Decision making is guided by fracture morphology, patient functionality, and physiological reserve to optimize clinical outcomes. Minimally invasive techniques, particularly for fragility fractures of the pelvis, have gained traction because of their ability to provide stable fixation while minimizing surgical morbidity. The importance of early mobilization and a multidisciplinary perioperative approach is highlighted as essential in reducing complications and improving recovery. Despite advancements, controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment of complex acetabular fractures in elderly patients. This review synthesizes the latest evidence and expert perspectives to aid clinicians in selecting the most appropriate management strategies, with the goal of restoring mobility, minimizing complications, and enhancing the quality of life in this vulnerable population.",

  "abstract": "There is longstanding evidence that the presence of psychosis in neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) is associated with faster cognitive and functional decline. The goal of this study was to examine how clinician-diagnosed psychosis differs among ethnoracial groups with NCDs (including early onset) and to explore whether these differences exist even for those without advanced dementia. This is an IRB-approved retrospective analysis. Data are from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Dataset from 42 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. Participants aged 40-95 years as of June 2023 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia on baseline evaluation were included. Psychosis was defined as clinician-diagnosed visual or auditory hallucinations or delusions manifesting at the time of baseline evaluation. Ethnoracial groups were self-reported. Associations between ethnoracial groups and psychosis in NCDs were estimated using adjusted multivariable logistic regression with dichotomous measures of outcomes. Covariates included age, sex, years of education, severity of cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating scale), and presence or absence of any self-reported preexisting psychiatric illness. An analysis by age younger than 65 years was also conducted. Exploratory multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for participants with milder stages of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 or 1) and for the subset of participants diagnosed with MCI. A total of 22,854 participants were included. The mean age was 73 + 9.7 years, and 50% were women. A total of 8,352 (37%) had MCI and 14,502 (63%) had dementia. In adjusted analysis, American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) (OR 2.70, 1.75-4.17,   < 0.0001), Black-Latino (OR 2.33, 1.25-4.35,   = 0.0076), Other-Latino (OR 1.82, 1.42-2.33,   < 0.0001), Black, non-Latino (NL) (OR 1.66,1.47-1.87,   < 0.0001), and White-Latino (OR 1.42, 1.21-1.67,   < 0.0001) participants had greater odds of any psychotic symptom than White-NL participants. For age groups 40 to younger than 65 years, only Black-NL participants (OR 1.56, 1.13-2.14,   = 0.0064) were more likely to be diagnosed with any psychotic symptoms. For milder stages of dementia, Black-Latino (OR 3.44, 1.58-7.48,   = 0.0018), AI/AN (OR 2.73, 1.66-4.48,   < 0.0001), Other-Latino (OR 2.38, 1.72-3.30,   < 0.0001), Black-NL (OR 2.08,1.77-2.45,   < 0.0001), and White-Latino (OR 1.55, 1.23-1.95,   = 0.0002) participants had greater odds of psychosis in NCDs when compared with White-NL participants. For MCI alone, there were no significant differences. Black-NL, Latino, and AI/AN individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with psychosis in NCDs when compared with White-NL participants.

  "abstract": "Several observational studies have revealed that different neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are associated with delirium, yet the direction and magnitude of the causal association remain poorly understood. Herein, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between these factors and delirium. GWAS data for delirium were sourced from the FINN10 database; GWAS data for risk factors (protein kinase C-binding protein NELL1, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, nerve growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor levels) were from the IEU Open GWAS. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as a primary analysis. MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and weighted model were applied to validate the robustness of the results. The MR-Egger regression method was used to explore the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, and the MR pleiotropy residual sum, and outlier (MR-PRESSO) method was applied to detect potential outliers. Cochran's Q test assessed heterogeneity among instrumental variables (IVs). The leave-one-out (LOO) method was used to enhance the precision and veracity of our findings. IVW analyses revealed no association between risk factors and delirium. MR Egger, WM, and the weighted mode approach further confirmed these data. MR-Egger regression analysis confirmed the absence of directional pleiotropy in our analysis. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses showed reliable results. No association between other factors and delirium was identified; however, further research is needed to determine if these results apply to other races. Also, advances in molecular biology and epigenetics may shed light on this topic.",

  "abstract": "Efficient wound healing remains a formidable medical challenge in clinical practice, due to the prevalence of skin defects arising from diverse etiological factors. It is indisputable that epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a pivotal role in wound repair. However, its clinical application through recombinant proteins encounters challenges, including a short half-life in vivo and high production costs. Addressing these limitations, recent advancements in chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) technologies offer a promising alternative. This study explores the utilisation of cmRNA in a biocompatible citrate-saline formulation to encode EGF for therapeutic purposes, capitalising on the advantages of cmRNA's inherent stability and the formulation's compatibility with biological systems. CmRNA demonstrated high transfection efficiency in human immortalised keratinocyte (HaCaT) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cells (93.97% ± 1.25% and 90.37% ± 0.97%, respectively), resulting in efficient production of biologically active EGF protein. In vitro, EGF cmRNA significantly promoted HaCaT and NHDF cell cycle, proliferation and migration. In vivo, in vivo imaging system (IVIS) imaging of murine skin confirmed localised and sustained expression of Luciferase cmRNA, with signals detectable up to 11 days post-injection. Immunohistochemistry revealed protein expression in both epidermal and dermal layers as early as 1 h post-injection, peaking at 48 h, further corroborated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a full-thickness skin defect mouse model, EGF cmRNA significantly accelerated wound healing, with superior re-epithelialisation observed compared to controls by Day 6. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Ki67 mRNA expression levels were markedly increased, both in vitro and in vivo. By Day 14, histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that EGF cmRNA outperformed recombinant human EGF (rhEGF), as indicated by enhanced formation of hair follicles and cutaneous glands, better-organised collagen fibres, and a reduced collagen Type I/III ratio. No adverse effects were observed in major organs, confirming cmRNA's biosafety. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of EGF-encoding cmRNA as an effective and safe alternative for enhancing wound healing.",

  "abstract": "Cancer cachexia (CC) is a fatal syndrome most prevalent in palliative care patients and is typically characterized by a progressive increase in weight loss and anorexia. The inability to detect and accurately appraise CC symptoms early can lead to a delayed diagnosis of CC and late initiation of symptom management, subsequently resulting in shorter survival. Research has shown that both patients and primary family caregivers are burdened by worsening CC symptoms, making them susceptible to reduced quality of life (QOL) and increased psychological distress in particular, and necessitating an exploration of ways to improve their well-being. Guided by the Theory of Dyadic Illness Management supplemented by the Symptom Appraisal Pathway Model, the study will be the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of dyadic appraisal of patients' CC symptoms on psychological distress and QOL of palliative care patients and their primary family caregivers over an eight-week follow-up period. This study will adopt a longitudinal mixed-methods design, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection at baseline and eight weeks after baseline. 281 dyads of patients with CC and caregivers will be recruited from palliative care units of three hospitals in Hong Kong. Both patients and caregivers will complete a set of questionnaires measuring appraisal of patients' CC symptoms and own psychological distress, and QOL, separately. Semi-structured joint interviews will also be conducted with the same dyads. Quantitative data will be analyzed using the actor-partner interdependence model and the polynomial regression with response surface analysis, while qualitative data will be subjected to qualitative content analysis and trajectory analysis. The findings of the two datasets will be integrated via joint displays. Findings of this study are expected to advance the emerging science on dyadic symptom management by testing the utility of the theory of Dyadic Illness Management and the Symptom Appraisal Pathway Model, but also to inform the design and content of a theory- and evidence-based CC management intervention to reduce psychological distress and to achieve optimal QOL in CC dyads.",

  "abstract": "People with dementia receive differential access to palliative care services despite suffering from a significant burden of the disease in the advanced stage. Professional and familial caregivers may not view dementia as a terminal illness and are less likely to engage in end-of-life care discussions. Healthcare providers also face challenges coordinating palliative care in the community for dementia, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the needs of patients living with advanced dementia, and resources available to support them within the community. The aim of this study is to implement a transmural model of care in a tertiary care setting where patients living with advanced dementia (PLAD) at risk of deterioration in one year are identified early to receive tailored palliative care interventions using a predictive algorithm. The updated medical research council (MRC) framework for complex interventions is used to guide the development and implementation of the transmural model which incorporates a predictive algorithm in clinical practice, with interventions tailored for at risk PLAD both within, and beyond the tertiary care setting. The PROgnostic Model for Advanced DEmentia (PRO-MADE) developed to predict one-year all-cause mortality in PLAD presenting to an acute care hospital was embedded into the electronic health records of the tertiary care setting as a mathematical equation. Predictive modeling markup language in the digital records platform is used to calculate the risk score for PLAD by inputting the predictors. The clinical team is alerted of at risk PLAD through timed directive prompts, with advice on management given through tailored care bundles. The study will adopt a mixed methods approach in a Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study design to concurrently study the effectiveness of the transmural model in practice, and the barriers and facilitators to its implementation. The implementation of a transmural model of early palliative care for patients with advanced dementia requires the coordination between clinicians in the tertiary care setting and community, together with health information technologists. This study protocol describes its development and implementation, and the study design to evaluate its outcomes.",

  "abstract": "To assess the ability of clinical inflammatory models to predict tumor regression grade (TRG) in response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) and survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We retrospectively analyzed 161 patients with LARC who underwent NCRT followed by total mesorectal excision at Beijing Hospital between May 2007 and March 2022. By using logistic and Cox regression analyses, we developed prediction models for TRG in response to NCRT and overall survival (OS), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that variations in neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts and pre-NCRT (preneoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy) CA19 - 9 levels independently predicted TRG in response to NCRT (all P < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that clinical tumor (cT) stage, pre-NCRT platelet count, CA19 - 9 level, number of lymph node metastases, and TRG could independently predict OS (all P < 0.05). On the basis of these results, we developed models to predict TRG and OS, respectively. The final predictive model for predicting the response to NCRT had areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.783 and 0.809 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively; for predicting the 5-year OS rate, the AUC rates were 0.842 and 0.930 in the training and test sets, respectively. The calibration and decision curves showed favorable performance in our prediction models. We combined inflammatory markers with tumor characteristics and successfully developed clinical prediction models for TRG in response to NCRT and OS in patients with LARC. Our findings offer insights for optimizing treatment in patients with LARC.",

Current guidelines endorse completion of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessments (CGAs) in older adults prior to treatment election to objectively measure frailty, however, these are rarely performed in urologic practice due to inadequate resources. We hypothesized CGA implementation would be feasible and identify multifaceted vulnerabilities beyond standard risk assessments in a multidisciplinary BC clinic and developed a novel method to visualize \"vulnerability phenotypes\" to guide supportive interventions. Adults with BC were prospectively enrolled (June, 2020-July, 2021). Initially, patients underwent standard of care (SOC) risk assessment (N = 27). Subsequently, patients completed CGAs augmented with body composition assessments (N = 67). CGA completion time, rates, and patient-reported burden were assessed. Interdependence of CGA domains were quantified using Spearman correlation coefficients and compared decisional conflict and regret between arms. Vulnerability phenotypes were visualized using Spider Plots, generated in R. Clinical and survival associations with CGAs were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. 94 patients were enrolled with a median age of 72 years. Instrument completion in the CGA cohort was 79% to 100%. 91% of patients reported CGA completion was at most minimally burdensome. CGAs identified vulnerabilities including 31% vulnerable-to-moderately frail, 21% with mild-to-severe depression, 3% with mild-moderate dementia, and 40% at risk for malnutrition-malnourished. Frailty measures across instruments were weakly correlated (rho <0.4). In this heterogeneous cohort, vulnerability domains were not significantly associated with decisional conflict/regret, survival, nor complication rates after treatment. A novel Spider Plot tool is proposed to facilitate communication of the dominant vulnerability-driving individual risks. CGAs can be successfully incorporated into uro-oncology practice with low perceived burden, identifying key vulnerabilities with implications for clinical care. Weak correlations across instruments support the value of gathering information across discrete domains. We present a novel approach to visually characterize personalized vulnerability phenotypes.",

  "abstract": "Vitamin D supplementation studies in various pleiotropic outcomes often yield conflicting results. This complexity arises from various factors, including individual differences (baseline Vitamin D levels, genetics, ethnicity, age, and gender). This review aims to clarify the complexities in Vitamin D supplementation research by examining various influencing factors, ultimately providing a comprehensive understanding to guide future studies and offer more accurate insights into the health impacts of Vitamin D supplementation. For this review, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, analyzing observational studies, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials to identify key factors influencing the efficacy of Vitamin D supplementation. By synthesizing findings from diverse research, we aimed to illuminate the nuances shaping the outcomes of these trials. In conclusion, the review suggests that several demographic and biological factors such as baseline 25(OH)D levels, age, ethnicity, genetics, body mass index, diet, sun exposure, medications, comorbid conditions, socioeconomic status, and self-supplementation all play significant roles in the outcomes of Vitamin D supplementation trials. In addition, the dose and duration of therapy, choice of daily versus bolus dosing, route of administration, and the role of free and bound forms of Vitamin D contribute to the complexity of trial results. Vitamin D's pleiotropic effects extend beyond calcium regulation, impacting various health aspects. Inadequate blood levels can confound trial outcomes, emphasizing the importance of reaching appropriate 25(OH)D thresholds. Study design, sample size, bias minimization, and methodology are critical in influencing trial outcomes and designing studies that account for baseline levels and compliance is crucial for meaningful and accurate results. Standardized assays and internationally agreed-upon cutoff levels are essential to mitigate variability in 25(OH)D measurements and improve result reliability.",

Diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism, pernicious anemia, hypogonadism, vitiligo, chronic atrophic gastritis, chronic autoimmune hepatitis, alopecia, myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and thrombocytic purpura may or may not be present. We present a case of a 28-year-old male, already diagnosed with Addison's disease for the past eight years. He presented to our medical department with nausea and vomiting over two days. On presentation, he was lethargic and dehydrated with sunken eyes as well as discoloration of the gums and skin. His abdomen was soft but mildly tender. He had high serum glucose levels and was diagnosed as a case of diabetic ketoacidosis based on urinary ketones and arterial blood gases, after being diagnosed with diabetes two months prior. On further investigation, his thyroid function test was deranged two months ago as well. This syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms depend on which gland becomes involved first. The patient was treated and improved with corticosteroids, thyroxine, and insulin therapy.",

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer effective therapy without injections or blood monitoring. This bibliometric analysis explores the research on NOACs for preventing VTE and pulmonary embolism. Literature up to July 20, 2024, was searched in Web of Science Core Collection. Citespace software was used for screening and analysis. In this study, we analyzed 2124 articles and 767 reviews from 11,282 institutions across 528 countries and regions, encompassing 830 publications and 60 research directions. The USA led in publication count, followed by Germany and Canada. Cardiovascular System Cardiology, Hematology, and General Internal Medicine were the top research areas, while THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS was the leading journal. From 2004 to 2024, we observed accelerated publication growth, particularly from 2008, highlighting the emergence of NOACs as a major research focus. Key contributors, including Bengt I. Eriksson, and major institutions like Harvard Medical School and University of Amsterdam, played pivotal roles in advancing anticoagulant research. Co-citation and keyword clustering analyses revealed research hotspots in NOACs, cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention, and COVID-19-related thrombotic events, reflecting a shift towards individualized anticoagulation therapy and the growing importance of NOACs in various clinical contexts. The development of NOACs has progressed rapidly, with an increasing number of publications, indicating the lead research in the United States and other Western nations. Comparative studies on the safety and efficacy of NOACs have become a significant focus, shifting from traditional anticoagulants. Pharmacogenetics-guided use of NOACS shows new hope of precision medicine.",

  "abstract": "The reactivation of neurodevelopmental programs in cancer highlights parallel biological processes that occur in both normal development and brain tumors. Achieving a deeper understanding of how dysregulated developmental factors play a role in the progression of brain tumors is therefore crucial for identifying potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) provides an opportunity to understand how developmental programs are dysregulated and reinitiated in brain tumors at single-cell resolution. The aim of this study is to identify the developmental origins of brain tumors using scRNA-Seq data. Here, we introduce COORS (Cell Of ORigin like CellS), a computational tool trained on developmental human brain single-cell datasets that annotates \"developmental-like\" cell states in brain tumors. COORS leverages cell type-specific multilayer perceptron models and incorporates a developmental cell type tree that reflects hierarchical relationships and models cell type probabilities. Applying COORS to various brain cancer datasets, including medulloblastoma (MB), glioma, and diffuse midline glioma (DMG), we identified developmental-like cells that represent putative cells of origin in these tumors. Our method provides both cell of origin classification and cell age regression, offering insights into the developmental cell types of tumor subgroups. COORS identified outer radial glia developmental cells within IDH  glioma cells whereas oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and neuronal-like cells in IDH . Interestingly, IDH  subgroup cells that map to OPC show bimodal distributions that are both early and late weeks in development. Furthermore, COORS offers a valuable resource by providing novel markers linked to developmental states within MB, glioma, and DMG tumor subgroups. Our work adds to our cumulative understanding of brain tumor heterogeneity and helps pave the way for tailored treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a fatal but treatable inborn error of immunity (IEI). Newborn screening (NBS) using T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) has been adopted globally, with very few countries incorporating kappa recombination excision circles (KREC) to also detect early B-cell development disorders, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). To evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-year pilot SCID NBS program in the Czech Republic, emphasising the utility of combined TREC/KREC screening. Between January 2022 and December 2023, a dual TREC/KREC NBS pilot was conducted across the Czech Republic, alongside spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) screening. Approximately 200,000 newborns were screened using quantitative real-time PCR on dried blood spots collected 48-72 h after birth. The pilot referred 58 newborns, identifying 21 cases of IEI, including two SCID cases, with an overall incidence of TREC/KREC screenable IEI of 10.5/100,000 newborns. SCID incidence was 1/100,000. KREC screening proved invaluable, detecting 10 cases of congenital agammaglobulinemia including novel non-XLA forms, which increased the estimated incidence of agammaglobulinemia in the Czech Republic sixfold. Over one-third of low KREC results were linked to maternal immunosuppression. The Czech pilot demonstrated the effectiveness of integrated TREC/KREC NBS in detecting both T- and B-cell immunodeficiencies. As of 2024, SCID and SMA screening are included in the nationwide NBS, with KREC screening significantly improving early detection of B-cell disorders.",

  "abstract": "In skeletal muscle, troponin T (TnT) exists in two isoforms, slow skeletal TnT (ssTnT) and fast skeletal TnT (fsTnT), encoded by the TNNT1 and TNNT3 genes, respectively. Nonsense or missense TNNT1 variants have been associated with skeletal muscle weakness and contractures and a histopathological appearance of nemaline myopathy (NM) on muscle biopsy. Little is known about how TNNT1 mutations ultimately lead to muscle dysfunction, preventing the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Here, we aimed to identify the underlying molecular biophysical mechanisms, by investigating isolated skeletal myofibres from patients with TNNT1-related NM as well as from controls through a combination of structural and functional assays. Our studies revealed variable and unusual ssTnT and fsTnT expression patterns and post-translational modifications. We also observed that, in the presence of TNNT1 variants, the thin filament was more compliant, and this was associated with a higher myofibre Ca  sensitivity. Altogether, our findings suggest TnT remodelling as the key mechanism ultimately leading to molecular and cellular hyper-contractility, and then inhibitors of altered contractility as potential therapeutic modalities for TNNT1-associated NM. KEY POINTS: No therapeutic treatment exists for patients with genetic TNNT1 mutations and skeletal muscle weakness/contractures. In these patients, expression and post-translational modifications of troponin T are severely disrupted. These are associated with changes in thin filament compliance where troponin T is located. All these induce muscle fibre hyper-contractility that can be reversed by mavacamten, a myosin ATPase inhibitor.",

This study investigated the role of DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) and its interplay with protein kinase G (PKG) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) in the rd1 mouse model for IRD. Immunofluorescence and quantitative western blotting analyses were performed to evaluate the expression of TOP2A, PKG1, PKG2, HDAC1, and other related markers. TSC24 and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid were used to specifically inhibit TOP2A and HDAC, respectively, in organotypic retinal explant cultures derived from wild-type or rd1 mice. Furthermore, we examined the effect of PKG activity on TOP2A phosphorylation using KT5823. Significant upregulation of TOP2A was observed in the rd1 mouse retina compared with wild-type controls, especially in the outer nuclear layer. Phosphorylation levels of TOP2A strongly correlated with photoreceptor cell death. Treatment with TSC24 significantly reduced TOP2A-positive and TUNEL-positive cells. TOP2A phosphorylation was accompanied by HDAC activation, which was mitigated by TSC24. PKG inhibition by KT5823 reduced TOP2A phosphorylation at specific residues and photoreceptor HDAC activity. Our findings position TOP2A in the PKG-TOP2A-HDAC photoreceptor degenerative pathway, offering new potential therapeutic targets for combating IRD-type diseases.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze and identify genes associated with neuronal regeneration after ischemic stroke (IS) and to predict potential therapeutic targets for neuronal regeneration after IS using bioinformatics analysis methods. The GSE137482 and GSE208121 datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the differentially expressed hub genes that showed decreased expression in GEO and increased expression in neuronal regeneration after IS were identified as key genes. To identify the key genes, functional enrichment and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network analysis were conducted. The expression levels of the key genes were characterized by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot in neuron-induced cell models. Additionally, possible regulatory networks of the key genes were analyzed. The screening process yielded 24 differentially expressed pivotal genes, which were predominantly enriched in processes related to epithelial cell proliferation regulation and hormone response. The PPI analysis yielded five key genes (Npas4, Nr4a3, Nr4a1, Egr4, and Egr1), which may exert regulatory roles primarily through peptide and peptide hormone responses. RT-qPCR and western blot assays confirmed that the expression levels of the key genes were elevated in the neuron-like differentiated cell model. However, these findings were inhibited by additional treatment with hypoxia. The analysis of the key gene regulatory network revealed that EGR1 and NR4A1 might regulate hub genes by utilizing their transcription factor properties, with EGR1 being the predominant regulator. The validation results from our cellular model indicated that upregulating EGR1 promotes neuronal-like differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells. EGR1 could potentially serve as a therapeutic target for neuronal regeneration following IS.",

  "abstract": "Male factors contribute to 50% of infertility cases, with 20%-30% of cases being solely attributed to male infertility. Helicase for meiosis 1 (HFM1) plays a crucial role in ensuring proper crossover formation and synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, an essential process in gametogenesis. HFM1 gene mutations are associated with male infertility, particularly in cases of non-obstructive azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia. However, the effects of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in HFM1-related infertility cases remain inadequately explored. This study identified novel biallelic HFM1 variants through whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a Chinese patient with severe oligozoospermia, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of these variants was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting, which revealed a significant reduction in HFM1 mRNA and protein levels in spermatozoa compared to those in a healthy control. Transmission electron microscopy revealed morphological abnormalities in sperm cells, including defects in the head and flagellum. Despite these abnormalities, ICSI treatment resulted in a favorable fertility outcome for the patient, indicating that assisted reproductive techniques (ART) can be effective in managing HFM1-related male infertility. These findings offer valuable insights into the management of such cases.",

  "abstract": "Intellectual disability is the subject of interest of psychiatry and special education. Both sciences in Poland adopt an inclusive model of care for people with disabilities. The path of each of them from a directive model to an inclusive model has been different. The aim of the study is to compare the attitude towards people with intellectual disabilities and the evolution of changes that have taken place in Polish special education and in Polish psychiatry in the last few decades. The comparison was carried out using the narrative method through a review of key publications on the understanding of the intellectual disability phenomenon by special education in Poland and by psychiatry. In 1989, Polish special education departed from dialectical materialism as a binding doctrine in the social sciences. A postmodern understanding of the phenomenon of disability, culminating in the formulation of a humanistic paradigm of special education consisting of four microparadigms, developed instead. Special education moved away from quantitative research in favor of qualitative research, negating the biomedical aspects of disability. Qualitative and conceptual research studies carried out in Poland have not entered the global circulation of scientific information and are known locally in Poland. Polish psychiatry has undergone a less revolutionary path of change than special education. The development of community psychiatry in Western Europe slowly began to be implemented in Poland. It has been implemented in recent years in the form of mental health centers. Since the beginning of the political transformation, Polish psychiatry has been present in international journals in published English with the Impact Factor. Despite the postmodern, inclusive understanding of mental disorders, but in contrast to Polish special education, Polish psychiatry is based on quantitative research studies. Their results are published in international journals. Polish special pedagogy of people with intellectual disabilities, as well as Polish psychiatry, have undergone a significant paradigmatic reconstruction in the last few decades. Both sciences adopted an inclusive model of understanding intellectual disability. The different ways of development of the two sciences are reflected in publications and scientific research, as well as in certain terminological differences.",

This study aimed to explore the biomarkers associated with primary resistance to first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs was defined as disease progression within 90 days (3 months) of treatment in patients with EGFR-sensitive mutant adenocarcinoma without any evidence of objective response. Retrospective, single-center study. This study retrospectively screened patients with NSCLC who received EGFR-TKIs at Hunan Cancer Hospital from January 2018 to December 2022. According to pre-determined clinical outcomes, we divided the patients into primary resistance and sensitivity groups. Only patients with sufficient samples that passed quality control were included in this study. Tumor tissue and paired peripheral blood samples collected from patients before treatment were subjected to next-generation sequencing using an 825-gene panel. In addition, tumor tissue samples were analyzed for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. A total of 70 patients were enrolled in this study, with 35 in each of the primary resistant and sensitive groups. Patients with exon 4 mutations in the   gene had significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those without the mutation.   and   mutation frequencies were substantially higher in the primary resistant group and were associated with shorter PFS and OS. Furthermore, patients in the primary resistant group exhibited substantially higher levels of PD-L1 expression. The potential mechanisms of primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs are highly heterogeneous. Combining some somatic variants affecting tumor function and high PD-L1 expression may contribute to this resistance.",

  "abstract": "Advanced care planning (ACP) and advance medical directives (AMDs) are vital for aligning medical decisions with patient preferences, particularly for end-of-life care. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment in India established the legality of AMDs, enabling patients to exercise their autonomy. Recent amendments in 2023 simplified procedural requirements, replacing judicial magistrate approval with a streamlined two-tier medical board system. This article proposes a culturally sensitive and practical 12-step framework for implementing ACP and AMDs in India. A structured and consensus-driven process was undertaken by experts in palliative medicine, neurology, critical care, and geriatrics, supported by key medical organizations. The development process included multiple iterations, public consultations, and feedback from legal and medical stakeholders. The framework integrates legal, ethical, and cultural considerations to address procedural and systemic challenges in ACP implementation. The proposed 12-step pathway focuses on three phases: creating living wills, periodic reviews and updates, and executing AMDs. Key components include initiating discussions, identification and appointment of surrogate decision-makers, ensuring legal compliance through simplified procedures, and providing guidance for withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments. Implementation strategies emphasize public awareness, provider training, and institutional policies to normalize ACP. Simplified legal requirements introduced in 2023 facilitate broader adoption and reduce procedural barriers. This framework provides a practical, culturally relevant model for ACP in India, ensuring patient-centered, ethical, and transparent end-of-life care. By integrating simplified legal procedures and addressing misconceptions through education and policy initiatives, the proposed approach empowers individuals, families, and healthcare providers to make informed decisions, fostering dignity and autonomy in medical care.

Two hundred thirty-nine patient registries (169 males, 70 females; mean age: 63.5 years) who underwent surgery were retrospectively analyzed between June 2021 and February 2024. All patients were operated by the same surgical team with a restrictive blood transfusion protocol. Forty-five (18.8%) cases were identified as MiECC. Most of the operations were coronary artery bypass grafting. Significant differences were observed between those operated on with MiECC and cCPB regarding the transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) suspensions and the total amount of drainage. No significant differences were observed in the duration of intubation, incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury, and intensive care unit or hospital stay. In geriatric patients, transfusion of RBC suspensions and drainage was significantly lower. Duration of intubation and intensive care unit or hospital stay did not reach statistical significance. In patients with an ejection fraction ≤45, transfusion of RBC suspensions were similarly low. The utilization of MiECC resulted in a reduction in transfusion of RBC suspensions and postoperative drainage. No significant differences were observed in intubation time, postoperative acute kidney injury, hospitalization, or mortality. Although intubation time was observed to be shorter, no statistically significant result could be reached. There is a potential for bias in patient selection due to the potential benefits of MiECC. We believe that with a larger number of blinded studies, the benefits of MiECC can be demonstrated in more detail, particularly in specialized populations such as geriatric patients and patients with low EF.",

  "abstract": "Dementia is a significant risk factor for adverse health outcomes, including pneumonia-related hospitalizations and readmissions. While comorbidities have been shown as predictors of poor pneumonia outcomes, the interplay between chronic comorbidities and acute physiological conditions, reflected by systemic biomarkers, remains underexplored. This study investigates the independent and joint effects of dementia and acute biomarkers on 30-day readmission risk following pneumonia hospitalization. We conducted a multicenter cohort study using data from three hospitals within the Taipei Medical University Clinical Research Database. Patients aged ≥45 years hospitalized for pneumonia between 2014 and 2021 were included. Dementia status was identified via ICD-9/10 codes, and acute systemic biomarkers were measured at the time of emergency department presentation. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause readmission. Multivariable logistic regression assessed independent associations, while joint-effects models examined the combined impact of dementia with biomarker abnormalities and comorbidities. Among 11,989 patients, 6.7% experienced 30-day readmission. Dementia was independently associated with readmission (adjusted OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.07-1.61). Other significant predictors included abnormal hemoglobin (OR: 1.55), creatinine (OR: 1.42), glucose (OR: 1.32), and comorbidities such as cancer, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. Joint-effects models showed that dementia amplified the impact of abnormal biomarkers, eg, patients with low hemoglobin and dementia had an OR of 1.98 compared to those with normal hemoglobin and no dementia. Dementia and acute biomarker abnormalities independently and synergistically increase 30-day readmission risk after pneumonia hospitalization, underscoring the need for integrated management strategies targeting both cognitive and systemic health.",

  "abstract": "Urban centers face a complex and multifaceted array of public health threats from infectious disease outbreaks and incidents of foodborne pathogens to health crises due to disasters, posing grave risks to people's health and societal stability. As the operational backbone of emergency response systems, public health rapid response teams are mission-critical in performing disease surveillance, outbreak containment, and clinical case management across all phases of emergencies. Nevertheless, persistent structural barriers including workforce deficits and competency mismatches constrain operational effectiveness during large-scale health emergencies. To address these challenges, this study proposes a resilience-building framework for public health rapid response teams that takes into account multi-hazard scenario planning and the evolving nature of events. Key interventions including institutional capacity building, strategic foresight initiatives, cross-sector policy integration, and tiered resource allocation systems have been implemented in order to enhance the core resilience dimensions of withstanding shocks, agile adaptability, and restoration of functioning.",

  "abstract": "The influences of ultrasound pretreatment on the catalytic activity, enzymatic properties and structure of two commercial lipases, Novozym51032 (lipase N) and Palatase20000L (lipase P), were studied by comparing the lipase kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of lipase and protein structure analysis. The experimental results showed that lipase N showed enhanced activity, while lipase P showed reduced activity under identical ultrasound conditions. Furthermore, the     of lipase N increased and the free energy (Δ ) decreased, whereas lipase P showed the opposite change. Both lipases underwent hydrophobic group exposure, yet the changes in their secondary structures were in opposition to one another. The intermolecular aggregates of lipase N were fragmented into small aggregates by ultrasound, a phenomenon not observed with lipase P. This result demonstrates that ultrasound stimulation enhances lipase activity primarily through the modulation of enzyme secondary structure and the disruption of intermolecular aggregates. Moreover, ultrasound treatment has been demonstrated to enhance the storage stability of the enzyme. These results demonstrate the potential value of ultrasound treatment in optimizing enzymes and bioprocesses.

  "abstract": "The Japan Institute for Health Security (JIHS) will be established in April 2025 by merging the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM). JIHS aims to enhance health security against infectious disease crises by integrating NIID's surveillance, epidemiologic investigation, and research expertise with NCGM's clinical care and research capabilities. An effective response to an infectious disease crisis depends on robust intelligence, systematic data analysis, and surge capacity - the ability to rapidly scale responses through mobilization of resources and an established infrastructure. An Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which centralizes emergency response coordination, is critical to harmonizing these diverse capabilities, enabling technical experts to focus effectively on specialized tasks. NIID has contributed to disease prevention through surveillance, laboratory reference services, and devising medical countermeasures. The establishment of NIID's Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response (CEPR) in 2020 and the EOC in 2021 markedly improved crisis management in the NIID, as demonstrated during events like Tokyo 2020 and the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant outbreak. These experiences highlight the importance of centralized coordination, which is being incorporated in the operational framework of the newly established JIHS. This article reviews NIID EOC's evolution and its crucial role in enhancing Japan's health security by consolidating lessons learned from recent public health crises.",

To clarify the effects of the adenosine A  receptor antagonist istradefylline (IST) on PD symptoms, we conducted a subanalysis of the 37-week ISTRA ADJUST PD randomized controlled trial. Patients with PD experiencing wearing-off with levodopa at 300-400 mg/day were randomized 1:1 to receive IST or no IST (control). Levodopa doses were titrated according to clinical severity throughout the study. PD symptoms were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). The efficacy analyses included 105 patients (IST, n = 52; control, n = 53). Regarding MDS-UPDRS subitems in patients in the IST group, significant improvements (  < 0.05) were observed at week 36 compared with baseline for both motor (e.g., facial expression, rigidity, finger tapping, toe tapping, time spent in the off state, and complexity of motor fluctuation) and non-motor (e.g., daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and doing hobbies and other activities) symptoms. In patients in the control group, significant improvements (  < 0.05) were observed for motor symptoms only. Regarding PDQ-39 subitems in patients in the IST group, significant improvements (  < 0.05) were observed at week 36 compared with baseline in doing up buttons or shoelaces, writing, feeling angry or bitter, and unexpectedly falling asleep during the day. IST can improve motor and non-motor symptoms and quality of life suggesting that it provides more comprehensive improvement in PD symptoms than increasing the levodopa dose alone.

  "abstract": "The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) was established in 2004 after the SARS epidemic. As a national disease control agency, KCDC strengthened its capacities for global health security based on experiences from some important issues such as the Influenza A/H1N1 pandemic (2009), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in Korea (2015), the Zika epidemic (2016), and COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2024). KCDC can make or revise infectious disease prevention and control related law, and collect, manage and analyze disease data from all the local public health centers and medical institutions in Korea. Based on the indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance and laboratory-based surveillance, KCDC conducts risk assessment for public health threats and has full responsibility as a competing authority in responding to outbreaks on a legal basis, which is specified in the national disaster framework. All quarantine stations in airports and sea ports belong to KCDC, and individual international travel history data at point of entries are linked to the National Health Insurance Services Database and medical doctors can access the database when the symptomatic individual visits the clinics/hospitals to check his/her travel history in the affected countries. This is a backbone to identify and notify imported infectious diseases from local clinic/hospitals to KCDC. Based on risk assessment in KCDC, KCDC triggers the Emergency Operations Center to respond. This KCDC-centered public health governance with centralized, comprehensive surveillance and response is one of the model cases from the health security perspective to consider for countries that are to establish new national public health institutes in the post-COVID-19 era.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed to clarify the association between frailty and the self-reported inability to immediately open a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle cap. This cross-sectional study included 427 participants aged 73 and 78 years in City A, Japan. Frailty was assessed using the Kihon Checklist (KCL), and PET bottle cap opening ability was surveyed using a mailed questionnaire. The participants were divided into Immediately Open and Cannot-Immediately Open groups. The frailty status and KCL scores were compared between the groups. Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the association between frailty and the PET bottle cap-opening pattern. The possibility of screening frailty based on the Immediately/Cannot-Immediately Open classification was analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The number of frailty in the Cannot-Immediately Open group was significantly greater than the expected count compared to the robust and pre-frailty groups (  <0.001). Total KCL scores differed significantly between the Immediately Open group (3.2 ± 3.1) and the Cannot-Immediately Open group (5.7 ± 4.1) (  <0.001). The Cannot-Immediately Open group showed significantly higher scores in 5 of the 7 domains and a higher proportion of 1-point scores in 15 of the 25 KCL items. Individuals in the Cannot-Immediately Open group were associated with frailty (β = 2.03; odds ratio = 7.62;   <0.001). The ROC analysis revealed a sensitivity and specificity of 50.0% and 81.0%, respectively (area under the curve = 0.65;   <0.001). The self-reported inability to open a PET bottle cap immediately may be a moderate screening tool for frailty and is associated with many frailty factors.",

This merger strengthens Japan's capacity to address infectious diseases and health threats, aiming for a resilient and secure society. This paper highlights the establishment of JIHS, its alignment with government reforms, and its strategic priorities for the future. The initiative originated on October 6, 2020, when the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council proposed measures to address vulnerabilities exposed by COVID-19. In 2022, the Japanese government called for formulating a central control tower, the Cabinet Agency for Infectious Disease Crisis Management (CAICM), upgrading the divisions related to infectious diseases to the Department of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), and establishing the JIHS. JIHS will serve as a scientific advisory body during infectious disease crises, guiding the Prime Minister and the MHLW. It focuses on four key areas:  ) Disease intelligence: risk assessment and data analysis;  ) Research, development, and innovation: advancing medical science;  ) Comprehensive medical services: strengthening clinical response capacity; and  ) Human resource development and international cooperation: building expertise and partnerships. Through integration, JIHS aims to improve existing systems and create synergy between basic and clinical research. As a hub for domestic and international collaboration, JIHS will consolidate critical information, catalyze innovative research, and deliver transformative solutions to address domestic and global infectious disease challenges.",

  "abstract": "Disruption of circadian rhythms and the condition of frailty are believed to be interrelated. Various manifestations of sleep disturbances, including insomnia, disrupted sleep-wake cycles, and alterations in sleep timing, are considered integral components of circadian rhythm disruption, which are also observed in individuals with frailty. Extensive research has established a connection between gut microbiota and both frailty and circadian rhythm disruption. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on investigating isolated links between gut microbiota and its metabolites with either frailty or circadian rhythm disruption, often neglecting the significant role that gut microbiota and its metabolites may play in the bidirectional relationship between circadian rhythms and frailty. Consequently, we propose the hypothesis that circadian rhythm disruption may induce frailty by altering the composition and structure of gut microbiota metabolites, and conversely, frailty may influence circadian rhythm disruption through similar mechanisms. The aim of our hypothesis is to emphasize the important role of gut microbiota metabolites in the bidirectional communication between circadian disruption and frailty and to speculate on the relevant mechanisms by which gut microbiota metabolites mediate the bidirectional communication between circadian disruption and frailty, rather than being solely related to frailty or circadian disorders.",

  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role of nursing professionals in infection control and patient care across various healthcare settings in Japan. Despite their dedication, the crisis exposed significant gaps in preparedness, training, and leadership development. This paper examines the challenges nurses and public health nurses faced during the pandemic and proposes a framework for strengthening capacity development to enhance future public health emergency responses. Fundamental infection control education must be systematically incorporated into basic nursing curricula, equipping nurses with essential skills such as proper use of personal protective equipment, zoning principles, and infection prevention strategies. Simulation-based training should complement theoretical instruction to ensure practical application. Continuous professional development through structured on-the-job training is crucial, particularly for smaller hospitals and elderly care facilities where infection control expertise remains limited. Public health nurses require specialized training in epidemiological investigations and outbreak management to coordinate community health responses effectively. Leadership in clinical settings and public health must be reinforced. The Infectious Disease Health Emergency Assistance Team (IHEAT) and supervisory public health nurses played key roles in the pandemic response. Still, challenges in rapid deployment and infrastructure readiness hindered their effectiveness. Strengthening managerial education and crisis response training will be critical to improving future outcomes. Additionally, networking and knowledge-sharing systems should be expanded to enhance communication and coordination. Mental health support for nursing professionals engaged in infection control must also be prioritized. This paper advocates a comprehensive approach to nursing education, training, and leadership development to fortify Japan's healthcare system against future pandemics.",

  "abstract": "Studies on human gut microbiota have recently highlighted a significant decline in bacterial diversity associated with urbanization, driven by shifts toward processed diets, increased antibiotic usage, and improved sanitation practices. This phenomenon has been largely overlooked in the Colombian Amazon, despite rapid urbanization in the region. In this study, we investigate the composition of gut bacterial microbiota and intestinal protozoa and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) in both urban and rural areas of Leticia, which is located in the southern Colombian Amazon. Despite their geographic proximity, the urban population is predominantly non-indigenous, while indigenous communities mostly inhabit the rural area, resulting in notable lifestyle differences between the two settings. Our analyses reveal a reduction in bacterial families linked to non-processed diets, such as   , and   , in the urban environment compared to their rural counterparts. Interestingly,   , typically associated with non-processed food consumption, shows a significantly higher abundance in urban Leticia. STH infections were primarily detected in rural Leticia, while intestinal protozoa were ubiquitous in both rural and urban areas. Both types of parasites were associated with higher gut bacterial richness and diversity. Additionally, microbial metabolic prediction analysis indicated differences in pathways related to unsaturated fatty acid production and aerobic respiration between rural and urban bacterial microbiomes. This finding suggests a tendency towards dysbiosis in the urban microbiota, possibly increasing susceptibility to non-communicable chronic diseases. These findings provide new insights into the impact of urbanization on gut microbiota dynamics in the Amazonian context and underscore the need for further research to elucidate any associated health outcomes. Changes in the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in urban populations have been linked to the rise of non-communicable chronic diseases, such as autoimmune conditions, diabetes, and cancer. As developing countries undergo a demographic shift towards increased urbanization, accompanied by changes in diet, housing, and medication use, there is a concerning loss of microbial diversity. Therefore, it is essential to investigate microbiota changes in overlooked populations, such as indigenous communities in the Colombian Amazon basin. A better understanding of local and generalizable changes in gut microbial composition through urbanization may facilitate the development of targeted programs aimed at promoting lifestyle and diet changes, to prevent diseases that healthcare systems may be ill-equipped to effectively address.",

Patients with multiple sclerosis (  = 50) and controls (  = 55) were prospectively enrolled and they underwent  C-ER176 PET and MRI including diffusion MRI with neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging. Disease characteristics, expanded disability status scale and multiple sclerosis functional composite scores were obtained in patients with multiple sclerosis. Age at imaging (mean ± standard deviation: patients = 49.6 ± 12.9 years, controls = 48.2 ± 15.4 years,   = 0.63) and sex (female ratio; patients = 72%, controls = 65%,   = 0.47) were not different between the groups. Thalamus  C-ER176 PET uptake was highest in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (1.272 ± 0.072 standardized uptake value ratio), followed by patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (1.209 ± 0.074 standardized uptake value ratio) and lowest in controls (1.162 ± 0.067 standardized uptake value ratio,   < 0.001). Patients with thalamic lesions had higher thalamus  C-ER176 PET uptake than those without thalamic lesions in both relapsing multiple sclerosis and progressive multiple sclerosis (  < 0.001). In patients with multiple sclerosis, higher thalamus  C-ER176 PET uptake correlated with lower thalamic volume (  = -0.45,   = 0.001), higher mean diffusivity (  = 0.56,   < 0.001), lower neurite density index (  = -0.43,   = 0.002), lower orientation dispersion index (  = -0.40,   = 0.005) and higher free water fraction (  = 0.42,   = 0.003) in the thalamus. In patients with multiple sclerosis, higher thalamus  C-ER176 PET uptake also correlated with higher mean diffusivity (  = 0.47,   < 0.001) and lower neurite density index (  = -0.36,   = 0.012) in the corpus callosum.

We found that compared with healthy control (HC) group, levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol (TC), homocysteine (Hcy), CRP and IL-6 were significantly increased in PSWCI and PSCI patients. Of them, levels of Hcy and IL-6 in PSCI group were significantly higher than that in PSWCI. ROC curve analysis identified Hcy and IL-6 as potential diagnostic biomarkers for PSCI. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota shows that the abundance of   and   increased, while the abundance of   and   decreased significantly. These findings suggest that elevated Hcy and IL-6 levels may serve as risk factors for PSCI, with gut microbiota dysregulation potentially contributing to its pathogenesis.",

  "abstract": "Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, Aβ and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD. A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability. The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm. Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity. These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the association of the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR) in predicting stroke incidence and all-cause mortality in low-income elderly populations. This prospective cohort study included participants who were middle-aged or elderly individuals from a low-income population in China. Participants were selected into the cohort and complete baseline assessments, which included questionnaire surveys, physical examinations, blood tests, and carotid artery ultrasound evaluations. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the associations of the NLR and MLR with the incidence of stroke and all-cause mortality. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). A total of 3948 participants were enrolled in the study. Over a median follow-up period of 7 years, 262 participants experienced stroke events and 227 participants died. After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the final model revealed that a higher NLR was significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (HR: 1.776, 95% CI: 1.250-2.254, P = 0.001) and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.558, 95% CI: 1.148-2.116, P = 0.004). Furthermore, a higher MLR was found to be associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.397, 95% CI: 1.054-1.852, P = 0.020), but no significant association was observed between MLR and stroke incidence. ROC analysis revealed that the AUC for NLR in predicting stroke was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.52-0.59, P=0.005), while the AUC for MLR was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.54-0.62, P<0.001). Similarly, the AUC for NLR in predicting all-cause mortality was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.53-0.61, P<0.001), and the AUC for MLR was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.57-0.65, P<0.001). These findings indicate that NLR is associated with an increased risk of stroke and all-cause mortality, while higher MLR is associated with all-cause mortality but not with stroke incidence. However, the modest predictive performance of both markers suggests that their clinical utility remains limited. Further research is needed to validate these associations and explore their potential role in comprehensive risk assessment models.",

  "abstract": "Advanced care planning (ACP) and advance medical directives (AMDs) are vital for aligning medical decisions with patient preferences, particularly for end-of-life care. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment in India established the legality of AMDs, enabling patients to exercise their autonomy. Recent amendments in 2023 simplified procedural requirements, replacing judicial magistrate approval with a streamlined two-tier medical board system. This article proposes a culturally sensitive and practical 12-step framework for implementing ACP and AMDs in India. A structured and consensus-driven process was undertaken by experts in palliative medicine, neurology, critical care, and geriatrics, supported by key medical organizations. The development process included multiple iterations, public consultations, and feedback from legal and medical stakeholders. The framework integrates legal, ethical, and cultural considerations to address procedural and systemic challenges in ACP implementation. The proposed 12-step pathway focuses on three phases: creating living wills, periodic reviews and updates, and executing AMDs. Key components include initiating discussions, identification and appointment of surrogate decision-makers, ensuring legal compliance through simplified procedures, and providing guidance for withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatments. Implementation strategies emphasize public awareness, provider training, and institutional policies to normalize ACP. Simplified legal requirements introduced in 2023 facilitate broader adoption and reduce procedural barriers. This framework provides a practical, culturally relevant model for ACP in India, ensuring patient-centered, ethical, and transparent end-of-life care. By integrating simplified legal procedures and addressing misconceptions through education and policy initiatives, the proposed approach empowers individuals, families, and healthcare providers to make informed decisions, fostering dignity and autonomy in medical care.

We report a multi-ancestry GWAS focusing on a narrow AUD phenotype, using novel statistical tools in a total sample of 1,041,450 individuals [102,079 cases; European, 75,583; African, 20,689 (mostly African-American); Hispanic American, 3,449; East Asian, 2,254; South Asian, 104; descent]. Cross-ancestry functional analyses were performed with European and African samples. Thirty-seven genome-wide significant loci (105 variants) were identified, of which seven were novel for AUD and six for other alcohol phenotypes. Loci were mapped to genes, which show altered expression in brain regions relevant for AUD (striatum, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex) and encode potential drug targets (GABAergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons). African-specific analysis yielded a unique pattern of immune-related gene sets. Polygenic overlap and positive genetic correlations showed extensive shared genetic architecture between AUD and both mental and general medical phenotypes, suggesting they are not only complications of alcohol use but also share genetic liability with AUD. Leveraging a cross-ancestry approach allowed identification of novel genetic loci for AUD and underscores the value of multi-ancestry genetic studies.

However, these studies involved different individuals performing each procedure, unlike the typical situation in the emergency department (ED) settings. This study aimed to determine the success rate of LP in infants when the same individuals within a diverse group of providers performed both procedures. This prospective, observational study was conducted in the ED of a paediatric tertiary care hospital and included infants aged < 90 days. Physicians performed ultrasound before the LP, ensuring that the needle insertion did not exceed the measured distance to the ventral subarachnoid space. The primary outcome was the proportion of successful LPs, and the secondary outcomes included factors associated with the success of the procedure. Eighty patients were included. The proportion of successful LP was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57%-77%), which was comparable to that achieved using the standard palpation method. Multivariable analysis found a significant association of LP success with the absence of patients' movements (odds ratio [OR]: 6.40; 95% CI: 1.53-26.8) and procedures performed by attending physicians (OR: 12.3; 95% CI: 1.48-102). Pre-LP ultrasound may not improve the success rate of LP in infants if performed by a diverse group of providers, even if the same providers perform both procedures. Factors such as minimising patients' movements and the providers' experience were significantly related to improving the LP success rate.",

Few studies have analyzed the complications and postoperative outcomes of CTA in medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction. The rate of complications and the outcomes of pediatric patients undergoing MPFL reconstruction would be similar between CTAs and low-dose irradiated allografts (IAs). Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. The medical charts of a consecutive cohort of pediatric patients (aged 12-18 years) who underwent MPFL reconstruction at a single center from June 2011 to September 2022 with either 1- or 2-year follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. Patient characteristics, operative data, and postoperative data were collected in those without diagnosed collagen disorder or multiligament reconstruction. Without deliberate allocation, CTAs were overwhelmingly gracilis tendon allografts, whereas the majority of IAs were semitendinosus. Complications were recorded and included infection, redislocation, and reoperation. Patient-reported outcomes were collected including the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, Kujala score, overall rating of treatment satisfaction, and pain score. A total of 235 (114 CTA, 121 IA) patients had 1-year follow-up with no significant differences in complication rate noted between the cohorts (CTA: 6/114 [5.3%]; IA: 5/121 [4.1%];   = .786). Of the entire group, 122 (60 CTA, 62 IA) patients had 2-year follow-up, with no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes between the CTA and IA cohorts at mean follow-ups of 35.9 and 38.3 months, respectively (  = .271). At a minimum 2-year follow-up, failure rates (defined as redislocation) were 5% (3/60) for the CTA group and 17.7% (11/62) for the IA group (  = .059). Reoperation rates (defined as redislocation requiring repeat operative intervention) were 5% (3/60) and 9.7% (6/62) for the CTA and IA cohorts, respectively (  = .433). CTA and IA for reconstruction of the MPFL in the pediatric patient demonstrate similarly low rates of complication, patellar redislocation, and need for revision surgery. Moreover, the outcomes appear to indicate that utilization of gracilis tendon CTA carries the same risk as low-dose semitendinosus IAs when managing children with MPFL reconstruction.",

  "abstract": "Vitamin D supplementation studies in various pleiotropic outcomes often yield conflicting results. This complexity arises from various factors, including individual differences (baseline Vitamin D levels, genetics, ethnicity, age, and gender). This review aims to clarify the complexities in Vitamin D supplementation research by examining various influencing factors, ultimately providing a comprehensive understanding to guide future studies and offer more accurate insights into the health impacts of Vitamin D supplementation. For this review, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, analyzing observational studies, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials to identify key factors influencing the efficacy of Vitamin D supplementation. By synthesizing findings from diverse research, we aimed to illuminate the nuances shaping the outcomes of these trials. In conclusion, the review suggests that several demographic and biological factors such as baseline 25(OH)D levels, age, ethnicity, genetics, body mass index, diet, sun exposure, medications, comorbid conditions, socioeconomic status, and self-supplementation all play significant roles in the outcomes of Vitamin D supplementation trials. In addition, the dose and duration of therapy, choice of daily versus bolus dosing, route of administration, and the role of free and bound forms of Vitamin D contribute to the complexity of trial results. Vitamin D's pleiotropic effects extend beyond calcium regulation, impacting various health aspects. Inadequate blood levels can confound trial outcomes, emphasizing the importance of reaching appropriate 25(OH)D thresholds. Study design, sample size, bias minimization, and methodology are critical in influencing trial outcomes and designing studies that account for baseline levels and compliance is crucial for meaningful and accurate results. Standardized assays and internationally agreed-upon cutoff levels are essential to mitigate variability in 25(OH)D measurements and improve result reliability.",

We sought to examine the population-level comparative mortality among mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 during the latter pandemic years using contemporaneous influenza comparators. We used a statewide dataset to identify mechanically ventilated hospitalizations aged ≥ 18 years with COVID-19 or influenza in Texas between October 2021 and March 2023. Their comparative short-term mortality (in-hospital death or discharge to hospice) was estimated using overlap propensity score weighting (primary model), entropy balance, and hierarchical logistic models. Among 22,195 mechanically ventilated hospitalizations, 19,659 (88.6%) had COVID-19 and 2,536 (11.4%) had influenza. Compared to mechanically ventilated hospitalizations with influenza, those with COVID-19 were more commonly racial or ethnic minority (49.3% vs. 48.4%) and had lower mean (standard deviation (SD)) Deyo comorbidity index (2.04 (2.03) vs. 2.53 (1.91)), but higher number of organ dysfunctions (2.60 (1.37) vs. 2.13 (1.27)), respectively. Short-term mortality among mechanically ventilated hospitalizations with COVID-19 and influenza was 49.1% vs. 20.7%.

In this study, our goal was to identify pathways involved in cloacal patterning and apply this to human hindgut cultures. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data comparing dorsal versus ventral cloaca in e10.5 mice revealed that WNT signaling was elevated in the ventral versus dorsal cloaca. Inhibition of WNT signaling in hindgut cultures maintained their differentiation toward colonic organoids. WNT activation promoted differentiation toward human urothelial organoids (HUOs). HUOs contained developmental stage specific cell types present in mammalian urothelial tissue including co-developing mesenchyme. Therefore, HUOs offer a powerful   model for dissecting the regulatory pathways that control the dynamic emergence of stage specific cell types within the human urothelium.",

Cardiovascular System Cardiology, Hematology, and General Internal Medicine were the top research areas, while THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS was the leading journal. From 2004 to 2024, we observed accelerated publication growth, particularly from 2008, highlighting the emergence of NOACs as a major research focus. Key contributors, including Bengt I. Eriksson, and major institutions like Harvard Medical School and University of Amsterdam, played pivotal roles in advancing anticoagulant research. Co-citation and keyword clustering analyses revealed research hotspots in NOACs, cancer-associated venous thromboembolism, stroke prevention, and COVID-19-related thrombotic events, reflecting a shift towards individualized anticoagulation therapy and the growing importance of NOACs in various clinical contexts. The development of NOACs has progressed rapidly, with an increasing number of publications, indicating the lead research in the United States and other Western nations. Comparative studies on the safety and efficacy of NOACs have become a significant focus, shifting from traditional anticoagulants. Pharmacogenetics-guided use of NOACS shows new hope of precision medicine.",

Effective interventions during this period are essential for fostering long-term mental health. Hence, a true experimental pretest-posttest control group design involving 20 ninth-grade students from government-aided and private schools in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu was completed. The eight-week nurse-led intervention included sessions on emotional self-awareness, stress coping, resilience building and mindfulness. The intervention group exhibited significant improvements in emotional regulation (mean increase of 9.8, p < 0.001) and resilience (mean increase of 22.6, p < 0.001) compared to the control group, which showed no significant changes. Further, a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.35, p = 0.05) was observed between gains in emotional regulation and resilience within the intervention group.",

Twenty-one patients diagnosed with EOAD in the memory clinic at Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital were enrolled during 2014-2018. We conducted whole-exome sequencing to identify the disease-causing variations and validated by Sanger sequencing. SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and AlphaFold were applied to predict the functional impact of the identified variants. Two unrelated normolipidemic EOAD patients were carrying a rare heterozygous   variant ( , NC_000019.10:g. 44905879 , NM_001302688.2:c. 11 > , and NP_001289617.1:p.Gly4Glu) with the allele frequency as 0.000206. Sanger sequencing uncovered the ∑ haplotypes in which the c.11G>A variation resided. SIFT predicted that the variant severely impacts protein structure and, maybe thus, function. AlphaFold predicted a dysfunctional conformation of the mutant APOE precursor a protein (p.Gly4Glu). Our data strongly suggest that the rare p.Gly4Glu variant is associated with EOAD but does not cause dyslipidemia.",

  "abstract": "The diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) can be hampered by its pronounced phenotypic variability and ARPKD-mimicking phenocopies. Here, for the first time we specifically studied the urinary peptidome of patients with ARPKD with the aim of distinguishing ARPKD from other causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Fifty-eight urine samples from patients with ARPKD, 662 urine samples from paediatric patients with CKD with various other CKD aetiologies and 45 samples from healthy children were included. The urinary peptidome was analysed by capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry. A 77-peptide signature specific for ARPKD was identified. Application of this signature in a matched random validation set of 19 samples of patients with ARPKD, 23 samples from patients with other CKD and 21 samples from healthy individuals led to a sensitivity of 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 60.4-96.6], a specificity of 100% (95% CI 92.0-100%) and an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.994 (95% CI 0.93-1.00). The 77-peptide signature displayed a specificity of 76.1% (95% CI 72.4-79.5) and an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.90) in 591 samples from non-matched children with various CKD aetiologies. The signature was primarily (83%) composed of collagen fragments indicating structural damage. Of the remaining peptides, five originated from proteins known to bind to calcium potentially linking the current work to defaults in calcium signalling in polycystic disease. We determined a urinary peptide signature that identifies paediatric patients with ARPKD with high precision among a population of children with CKD. Knowledge of the identity of the underlying peptides offers a novel starting point for discussion of possible pathophysiological processes involved in ARPKD.",

  "abstract": "Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma (DDLPS) is one of the common subtypes of liposarcoma that is considered a highly malignant category. This study aims to investigate DDLPS through a system biology approach. The gene expression profiles and clinical traits of the DDLPS were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The identification of co-expressed modules was conducted using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis. The immune cell-related gene function was studied by a web-based tool, TIMER, and, the survival analysis was performed at both the module and single-gene levels through Cox Regression analysis. Gene enrichment analysis was also conducted using the DAVID tool. One of the nine co-expressed DDLPS modules was significantly correlated with leukocyte fraction, hyper/hypo methylation, tumor purity, and chromosome instability (CIN). Based on the biological processes used to classify genes, the hub genes in a particular module play important roles in DNA repair, microtubule organizing clusters, mitotic checkpoint dysregulation, and cell proliferation signaling pathways. After screening the genes based on intra-module connectivity, module membership, and gene significance   was selected as one of the important hub genes.   showed poor prognosis to the overall survival (OS) analysis (HR=1.6, 95% CI=1.1-2.4, p=0.02). No co-expressed modules had relationship with OS. Through DDLPS traits, CIN and hyper/hypo methylation had significant negative relationship with OS. Our achievement confirmed the inverse association between tumor purity for DDLPS gene profiles and leukocyte fraction and negative leukocyte fraction (LF) gene significance in some genes was justified according to the sub-population analyses of immune cells in TIMER.",

  "abstract": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, head-to-head comparisons between dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, two widely prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors, remain limited. This meta-analysis aimed to directly compare the cardiovascular outcomes of these agents in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a comprehensive literature search across multiple databases and included eight retrospective studies enrolling 280,617 patients (158,352 receiving empagliflozin and 122,265 receiving dapagliflozin). The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with secondary outcomes including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Our pooled analysis revealed no significant difference in MACE risk between empagliflozin and dapagliflozin (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.13). Similarly, no significant differences were observed for all-cause mortality (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.15), myocardial infarction (RR: 1.04; 95% CI: 0.94 to 1.16), or stroke (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.91 to 1.09). Subgroup analyses by gender, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease status showed consistent results. However, in patients with heart failure, a trend toward reduced MACE risk was observed with empagliflozin (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.00). Despite pharmacokinetic differences between these agents, our findings suggest comparable cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes, with potentially enhanced benefits of empagliflozin in those with heart failure. However, due to lack of studies, this finding should be interpreted with caution. These results provide valuable insights for clinical decision-making when selecting SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetic patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore potential mechanistic differences between these agents.",

  "abstract": "Hearing loss (HL) can occur at any age, with hereditary HL being one of the most prevalent congenital disabilities. In the present study, a cohort of pediatric patients with HL was established, comprising 259 individuals at the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University from 2017-2022. All patients underwent comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, including complete clinical examinations and audiological assessments. Targeted genomic enrichment with massively parallel sequencing was applied to analyze the mutation spectrum of known hearing-loss genes in 253 Chinese children who had positive hearing screening results. Among the 253 patients, 211 (83.40%) exhibited bilateral HL, while 42 (16.60%) had unilateral HL. Targeted sequencing identified 197 variants in 104 genes, yielding a detection rate of 41.1%. A total of 144 genotypes were identified, including 62 heterozygous mutations, 6 hemizygous mutations, 23 homozygous mutations and 48 complex heterozygous mutations. The four most frequently identified genes were   (26.5%),   (13.5%),   (6.5%) and   (6.5%). Additionally, 33 novel variants in deafness-associated genes were discovered, comprising 21 novel pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and 12 variants of uncertain significance. The present results highlight the genetic profile of HL in the Chinese population, with GJB2 being the most prevalent causative gene in early-onset deafness. Furthermore, the current findings provide insight into age- or severity-related gene frequencies for HL. For the genetically unsolved cases, further investigation into digenic inheritance models or other contributing factors is warranted.",

  "abstract": "Intellectual disability is the subject of interest of psychiatry and special education. Both sciences in Poland adopt an inclusive model of care for people with disabilities. The path of each of them from a directive model to an inclusive model has been different. The aim of the study is to compare the attitude towards people with intellectual disabilities and the evolution of changes that have taken place in Polish special education and in Polish psychiatry in the last few decades. The comparison was carried out using the narrative method through a review of key publications on the understanding of the intellectual disability phenomenon by special education in Poland and by psychiatry. In 1989, Polish special education departed from dialectical materialism as a binding doctrine in the social sciences. A postmodern understanding of the phenomenon of disability, culminating in the formulation of a humanistic paradigm of special education consisting of four microparadigms, developed instead. Special education moved away from quantitative research in favor of qualitative research, negating the biomedical aspects of disability. Qualitative and conceptual research studies carried out in Poland have not entered the global circulation of scientific information and are known locally in Poland. Polish psychiatry has undergone a less revolutionary path of change than special education. The development of community psychiatry in Western Europe slowly began to be implemented in Poland. It has been implemented in recent years in the form of mental health centers. Since the beginning of the political transformation, Polish psychiatry has been present in international journals in published English with the Impact Factor. Despite the postmodern, inclusive understanding of mental disorders, but in contrast to Polish special education, Polish psychiatry is based on quantitative research studies. Their results are published in international journals. Polish special pedagogy of people with intellectual disabilities, as well as Polish psychiatry, have undergone a significant paradigmatic reconstruction in the last few decades. Both sciences adopted an inclusive model of understanding intellectual disability. The different ways of development of the two sciences are reflected in publications and scientific research, as well as in certain terminological differences.",

Cross-ancestry functional analyses were performed with European and African samples. Thirty-seven genome-wide significant loci (105 variants) were identified, of which seven were novel for AUD and six for other alcohol phenotypes. Loci were mapped to genes, which show altered expression in brain regions relevant for AUD (striatum, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex) and encode potential drug targets (GABAergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons). African-specific analysis yielded a unique pattern of immune-related gene sets. Polygenic overlap and positive genetic correlations showed extensive shared genetic architecture between AUD and both mental and general medical phenotypes, suggesting they are not only complications of alcohol use but also share genetic liability with AUD. Leveraging a cross-ancestry approach allowed identification of novel genetic loci for AUD and underscores the value of multi-ancestry genetic studies. These findings advance our understanding of AUD risk and clinically-relevant comorbidities.",

The integration of AI across fields enables a systemic approach to understanding chronic inflammation, a central driver in conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and neuropsychiatric disorders. We propose that through the use of imaging data with biomarkers like cytokines and genetic variants, AI models can better trace the effects of inflammation on immune and metabolic disruptions.

In this retrospective study, 126 surveys assessing symptoms in women (30-69 years) with Tarlov cysts (TCs) ≥ 7 mm seeking treatment for chronic back, pelvic or leg pain and skin biopsy results from 75 patients assessing intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) were reviewed. IENFD < 5th percentile was documented in 80% of PTCs according to the normative reference data of Collongues et al and 72% according to the worldwide dataset of Lauria et al Questionnaires revealed high incidences of neuropathic pain (80%), allodynia (76%), pain while sitting (93%), anal sphincter (11%) and urinary sphincter (66%) problems, persistent genital arousal (27%), and restless legs (54%). Autonomic dysfunctions included early satiety (41%), bladder (93%) and bowel (88%) dysfunction, increased sweating (51%), and Raynaud's phenomenon (45%). Other symptoms potentially associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) were headaches (57%), fatigue (86%), cognitive issues (86%), and pulsatile tinnitus (59%). This study revealed a high prevalence of SFN in PTCs (72-80%). Although the TCs may not cause radicular pain in the corresponding dermatomes directly, individuals with TCs frequently report a range of symptoms that have previously been linked to symptomatic TCs, including bladder, bowel, sphincter, and sexual symptoms, as well as local pain. Additionally, seemingly unrelated symptoms, such as headaches, fatigue, cognitive difficulties, neuropathic pain localized in other parts of the body, and autonomic dysfunctions, are commonly reported. These symptoms may be associated with elevated CSFP within the nerve root sheath. Elevated pulsatile CSFP underlies the formation of TCs at the dorsal root ganglion and may gradually contribute to small-fiber dysfunction by irritating, compressing and damaging small nerve fibers within the dorsal root ganglion. : This study focused on how common small-fiber neuropathy (SFN) is in patients with Tarlov cysts (TCs) and examined their symptoms, especially those linked to SFN and increased spinal fluid pressure. : Researchers reviewed surveys from 126 women (ages 30–69) with TCs larger than 7 mm who sought treatment for chronic back, pelvic, or leg pain. Skin biopsy results from 75 of these patients were also used to quantify small nerve fibers. : A reduction in nerve fiber count per mm skin, a sign of SFN, was found in 72–80% of patients. Common symptoms included nerve pain (80%), sensitivity to touch (76%), pain while sitting (93%), bladder problems (93%), bowel issues (88%), genital arousal (27%), and restless legs (54%). Many reported headaches (57%), fatigue (86%), memory difficulties (86%), and pulsating ear noise (59%). Other symptoms included autonomic dysfunctions (problems with the body’s automatic functions), such as sweating problems (51%), and circulation issues like Raynaud’s phenomenon (45%). : Most patients with TCs show signs of SFN and report various symptoms, including bladder, bowel, and sexual issues, as well as widespread nerve pain and other problems like fatigue and cognitive issues. These symptoms may be caused by increased spinal fluid pressure, which stretches the nerve coverings to form Tarlov cysts and also damages small nerves in the spinal canal. Over time, this pressure could lead to SFN.",

This single-person interview study recruited people living with schizophrenia, caregivers, and prescribers across France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in which participants were asked about their treatment experiences, views on an ideal treatment, and preferences on LAI dosing frequency. A qualitative analysis of interview transcripts was performed to identify key themes. Fifteen people living with clinically stable schizophrenia, 11 caregivers, and 13 prescribers were interviewed. When talking about current treatment (a once-monthly LAI), people living with schizophrenia and caregivers expressed mixed views, with some describing treatment as \"easy\", whilst others described a fear that treatment will stop working or are frustrated with the frequency of appointments. When asked about treatment goals, a common theme was wishing for the person living with schizophrenia to be clinically stable, leading to a reduction in symptoms and emotional outbursts. When asked about an LAI administered once every 2 months, people living with schizophrenia and caregivers expressed positive views, and perceived that such a treatment would be less burdensome than current treatment. Prescribers were open to recommending an LAI given once every 2 months to clinically stable patients, or those expressing a preference for a decreased dosing frequency or for LAIs in general. In this qualitative study, participants expressed overall positive views on a potential transition to an LAI given once every 2 months, due to the advantages of greater freedom and less treatment burden. Selection of a specific LAI should acknowledge individual patient and caregiver preferences regarding formulation and frequency, to ensure that targeted disease management goals are met.",

  "abstract": "Purpose  In late 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread to become a worldwide pandemic with continued impact today. The disease severity is categorized based on age, comorbid conditions, and respiratory symptoms, but the clinical significance of pain reports and their correlation with life-sustaining treatment is not addressed much in the literature. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between pain reports in patients with COVID-19 and the likelihood of intubation. Methods A retrospective cross-sectional analysis was performed compiling representative billing codes for pain complaints using the Epic Cosmos data set, a HIPAA limited data set of more than 226 million patients from 236 health systems using Epic software. For validation of this method, three months of institutional-specific Cosmos billing code data were compared to chart-reviewed pain complaints at a university health system. After validation, the data was broadened to include the entire Cosmos database from February 1, 2020 through April 15, 2023 for patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections seen in emergency rooms or an inpatient ward. Using billing codes, these patients were divided into different pain groups: abdominal pain, chest pain, myalgia, headache, or none of these, and then further subdivided based on intubation status. Lastly, patients were divided by age: <18 years, 18 to <40 years, 40 to <50 years, 50 to 65 years, and ≥65 years of age. Pearson's chi-square analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between pain symptoms and intubation and further performed to assess variations by age subgroup. Odds ratios (ORs) of the data were calculated in the same manner. Results We investigated 2,491,770 data points in our analysis of COVID-19 positive emergency room and inpatient cases. When comparing the presence of all pain types combined and intubation by the chi-square test, the p-value (p) was <0.00001, suggesting that a relationship exists between pain and intubation. OR analysis showed that those with pain complaints were less likely to be intubated with OR 0.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.59, p <0.0001). Pain subgroups similarly showed reduced likelihood of intubation: abdominal pain, OR of 0.61 (95% Cl: 0.59 - 0.62), chest pain, OR of 0.86 (95% Cl: 0.85 - 0.88), myalgia, OR of 0.26 (95% Cl: 0.24 - 0.27) and headache, OR of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.29 - 0.32). Conclusions Due to the wide variability in COVID-19 infection symptoms, it is difficult to identify a single risk factor that correlates with an increased likelihood of intubation. Our cross-sectional examination of 2.4 million data points for COVID-19 patients in the emergency department or inpatient settings found that pain complaints were negatively correlated with emergency intubation. Given this, the absence of pain reports in hospitalized COVID-19 patients may imply poor prognosis; however, further research is needed to determine whether the absence of pain is indeed a poor prognostic indicator and if so, hospitalized COVID-19 patients without pain warrant close monitoring.",

  "abstract": "Certain observable parenting behaviors contribute to the risk of children developing internalizing and externalizing problems. Yet parenting behaviors do not affect all children uniformly and effects may depend on identifiable child characteristics. One factor is a child's biological sensitivity to the caregiving environment, an indicator of which is a stress hormone, cortisol. This longitudinal study examines two dimensions of observable parenting behaviors, responsive and rejecting/harsh. These parenting behaviors and child cortisol awakening response (CAR) were measured during home visits in a sample of 100 mostly low-income White and Latina/Hispanic mothers and their children at ages 4-6. Children's internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed one year later. We tested the effects of responsive and harsh/rejecting parenting on child internalizing and externalizing and examined child CAR as a moderator. Results indicated that responsive parenting predicted better child mental health as indexed by fewer internalizing and externalizing behaviors, whereas harsh/rejecting parenting predicted more internalizing behaviors. Harsh/rejecting parenting interacted with child CAR such that harsh/rejecting parenting predicted more externalizing only among children with low CAR; there was no interaction of responsive parenting with child CAR. These results elucidate how child CAR may shape mental health outcomes associated with harsh/rejecting parenting.",

  "abstract": "Our goal in this manuscript was to perform a survival analysis and understand the causes of death (CODs) in patients with glioblastoma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using version 8.3.9.2 of SEER*Stat software to extract data from the SEER 17 Plus database. Patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV glioblastoma diagnosed between 2000 and 2019 were included to calculate overall survival (OS), relative survival (RS), and conditional survival. R software was used to calculate univariate and multivariate Cox regression models for age, sex, and race to identify their effect on survival. We included 45,071 patients with grade IV glioblastoma according to WHO 2016 classification. The observed 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates showed a decline to 40.1%, 9.8%, and 5.2%, respectively. Similarly, the relative 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 40.7%, 10.2%, and 5.4%, respectively. The conditional 3-year survival rates improved up to 16.9%, 42.9%, and 60.2% after 1, 3, and 5 years of survival, correspondingly, with females showing better estimates. The most common cancer CODs were the brain and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers. Among non-glioblastoma cancer CODs, breast cancer was the most common cause. Additionally, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and septicemia were the most common non-cancer CODs. In this study, patients with glioblastoma showed a sharp decline in OS and RS over time after diagnosis. However, there was a notable improvement in conditional 3-year survival over time. Cardiovascular diseases emerged as the most common non-cancer COD, with lower survival rates in males and advanced age.",

  "abstract": "Isolated radial head dislocation in children is a rare but significant injury, often resulting from trauma. It is clinically challenging to diagnose due to its subtle symptoms and can lead to serious long-term consequences if not treated promptly. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent persistent elbow pain, stiffness, instability, and functional impairment. This report details four cases of isolated radial head dislocation in children, each following trauma. All patients underwent closed reduction and were immobilized in a splint for three weeks. The cases were reviewed to highlight the importance of timely intervention and the outcomes of the treatment approach. Despite advances in treatment techniques, the exact mechanism behind isolated radial head dislocation remains unclear. Radial head dislocations are more commonly seen in adults, and their presentation in children can be easily overlooked due to less pronounced clinical and radiological symptoms. A precise diagnosis is essential to avoid long-term complications such as instability and functional limitations. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of isolated radial head dislocation in children are essential for preventing lasting effects. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize post-reduction management strategies to improve long-term outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Aging in humans is a heterogeneous process influenced by both biological and chronological factors. Biological age reflects an individual's physiological reserve and functional status. Increasing evidence suggests that cancer and its therapies accelerate biological aging. Many biomarkers have been evaluated to assess the biological age of patients with cancer. These biomarkers are emerging as potential tools to predict cancer-related toxicity and an individual's functional capacity as well as to individualize treatment. This review summarizes the current literature on aging biomarkers in cancer patients, with a focus on markers of cellular senescence and epigenetic modification. We evaluate the existing evidence supporting their use as predictors of toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Biomarkers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukocyte telomere length (LTL), and DNA methylation age show potential for assessing biological age, frailty, and functional reserve. The expression of p16INK4A has demonstrated promise in predicting therapy-induced toxicity and making treating decisions. However, additional confirmatory studies are necessary to further validate these biomarkers before they can be utilized as decision aids. Aging biomarkers hold promise for individualizing cancer therapy and predicting treatment-related toxicity. However, further studies are essential to validate their reliability and support their integration into clinical practice.",

  "abstract": "Male factors contribute to 50% of infertility cases, with 20%-30% of cases being solely attributed to male infertility. Helicase for meiosis 1 (HFM1) plays a crucial role in ensuring proper crossover formation and synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, an essential process in gametogenesis. HFM1 gene mutations are associated with male infertility, particularly in cases of non-obstructive azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia. However, the effects of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in HFM1-related infertility cases remain inadequately explored. This study identified novel biallelic HFM1 variants through whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a Chinese patient with severe oligozoospermia, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The pathogenicity of these variants was assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting, which revealed a significant reduction in HFM1 mRNA and protein levels in spermatozoa compared to those in a healthy control. Transmission electron microscopy revealed morphological abnormalities in sperm cells, including defects in the head and flagellum. Despite these abnormalities, ICSI treatment resulted in a favorable fertility outcome for the patient, indicating that assisted reproductive techniques (ART) can be effective in managing HFM1-related male infertility. These findings offer valuable insights into the management of such cases.",

  "abstract": "The prognosis for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC) who have not responded to gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP)-based therapy is dismal. Fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy could be considered for those patients who are refractory to GP-based treatments. Our study aimed to evaluate the real-world efficacy and safety of 5-FU-based chemotherapy for BTC patients who had progressed after gemcitabine-based treatment. This study analyzed patients from Seoul St. Mary's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital with advanced BTC who had previously failed treatment with GP-based chemotherapy. From June 2020 and May 2024, these patients received 5-FU-based chemotherapy as a second-line treatment. The 5-FU-based systemic treatments encompassed 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX); 5-FU, leucovorin, and liposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI/FL); and 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Our investigation focused on evaluating the survival outcomes and safety profiles of each regimen within this cohort. In our analysis of 147 patients, the primary tumor sites were distributed with 56 (38.1%) having intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, 51 (34.7%) with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and 40 (27.2%) with gallbladder cancer. Regarding the 5-FU-based regimens, 57 patients (38.8%) were treated with FOLFOX, 56 (38.1%) with Nal-IRI/FL, and 34 (23.1%) with FOLFIRINOX. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 2.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-2.6) and 4.8 months (95% CI, 3.8-5.8), respectively. Poor performance status and higher histologic grade were associated with worse PFS and OS, while female gender and prior surgery were linked to improved OS. FOLFOX and Nal-IRI/FL demonstrated comparable efficacy, with a median OS of 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.5-7.3) for FOLFOX and 4.7 months (95% CI, 2.6-6.9) for Nal-IRI/FL, and no significant differences were observed across subgroups. Grade 3 or higher neutropenia and biliary events were less frequent with FOLFOX, which also showed a lower incidence of adverse events and higher relative dose intensity than Nal-IRI/FL or FOLFIRINOX. In patients with advanced BTC who failed GP treatment, the FOLFOX regimen demonstrated comparable efficacy, and a more favorable safety profile compared to other 5-FU-based treatments. Given its favorable toxicity profile in a real-world setting, FOLFOX should be considered a standard second-line treatment option.",

  "abstract": "Hypermanganesaemia with Dystonia 1 and 2 (HMNDYT1 and 2) are inherited, autosomal recessive disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the genes encoding the manganese transporters SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, respectively. Impaired hepatic and enterocytic manganese uptake (SLC39A14) and excretion (SLC30A10) lead to deposition of manganese in the basal ganglia resulting in childhood-onset dystonia-parkinsonism. HMNDYT1 is characterized by additional features due to manganese accumulation in the liver causing cirrhosis, polycythaemia, and depleted iron stores. High blood manganese levels and pathognomonic MRI brain appearances of manganese deposition resulting in T1 hyperintensity of the basal ganglia are diagnostic clues. Treatment is limited to chelation therapy and iron supplementation that can prevent disease progression. Due to their rarity, the awareness of the inherited manganese transporter defects is limited. Here, we provide consensus expert recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with HMNDYT1 and 2 in order to facilitate early diagnosis and optimize clinical outcome. These recommendations were developed through an evidence and consensus-based process led by a group of 13 international experts across the disciplines of metabolic medicine, neurology, hematology, genetics, and radiology, and address the clinical presentation, diagnostic investigations, principles of treatment, and monitoring of patients with HMNDYT1 and 2.",

In children and adolescents, scapula tumors are rare. Moreover, the growing skeleton and high functional demands in this age group may hinder transferability of the promising results achieved in adults. This study aims to explore the functional outcome and different reconstructive options used in children undergoing (partial) scapulectomy. A single-center retrospective analysis of scapula tumors in children was performed. Furthermore, a systematic review and synthesis of qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted to investigate the functional outcome of children and adolescents undergoing Malawer II or Malawer III resection. In total, 3 patients were deemed eligible for the single-center retrospective analysis. The 3 children (2 boys, 1 girl, aged 4 - 11 years) all had Ewing sarcoma of the scapula. Two patients underwent Malawer II resection and had a better functional outcome than the 1 child that underwent Malawer III resection. Concerning the systematic review, of the 714 initial search results, 17 studies were eligible for inclusion. In total, 47 patients were extracted from the 17 studies. The analysis showed that patients who underwent Malawer III resection had a significantly better functional outcome if a reconstructive surgery was performed. Patients who underwent glenoid-preserving Malawer II resection showed similar results with or without reconstruction. Children and adolescents undergoing Malawer III resection benefit from a reconstructive procedure other than humeral suspension. Reconstruction using either endoprosthesis or extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation provide similar functional outcome after Malawer III resection. In Malawer II resection, reconstructive procedures do not influence functional outcome.",

  "abstract": "Despite well-recognized challenges in implementing palliative radiation therapy (PRT), progress remains slow, and conventional approaches have yielded limited success. A transformative strategy is required to overcome systemic barriers and establish a sustainable PRT infrastructure. This proposal presents a novel model to improve accessibility, affordability, and integration into palliative care by addressing key obstacles in training, regulation, facility development, and treatment protocols. A specialized certification track within radiation oncology residency programs is proposed, enabling palliative care physicians to obtain limited PRT licenses under the supervision of fully licensed radiation oncologists. Regulatory adjustments should facilitate this framework, ensuring compliance while expanding the PRT workforce. Dedicated PRT facilities-affiliated with comprehensive radiation therapy centers (CRTCs) and integrated into hospice settings-will enhance accessibility by reducing logistical and financial burdens. These facilities will utilize cost-effective infrastructure, including refurbished linear accelerators, modular construction, and remote physics and dosimetry support, ensuring operational costs remain significantly lower than those of conventional radiotherapy centers. Optimizing PRT delivery requires shifting clinical strategies toward single-fraction treatment as the primary approach, followed by hypofractionation treatment when necessary. Systematic studies with a PRT-oriented mindset should establish PRT-specific treatment recommendations and recommendations, moving away from conventional radiation therapy protocols. By addressing key barriers in education, regulation, infrastructure, and clinical strategy, this model offers a path toward sustainable PRT implementation. While requiring initial investment and regulatory adjustments, it has the potential to improve end-of-life care for terminally ill cancer patients, ensuring greater dignity and comfort while establishing a robust foundation for future reimbursement models.",

Patients with gestational sacs <20 mm could choose local anaesthesia; patients with larger gestational sacs were managed under sedation. Feasibility, tolerability and complications were evaluated. Postoperative retained products of conception (RPOC) were assessed after the first menstrual period. Gestational tissue was analysed for aneuploidy using chromosomal microarray analysis. Thirty-six patients were included, with a mean ± SD age of 36.7 ± 4.1 years. Mean gestational age and gestational sac size were 9 + 1/7 weeks and 27.5 mm, respectively. Mean procedure time was 17.7 min, with no peri- or postoperative complications. Outpatient procedures (n = 10) were well tolerated, with one requiring conversion to sedation.

By leveraging educational theories, we designed and implemented an interactive, learner-focused, reflective workshop-the Sailboat activity-offering educators an opportunity to evaluate their research plans and hone their research planning skills. Preworkshop, participants represented their research plan on a Sailboat diagram and completed a preworkshop survey assessing their confidence in designing a research project. During the 90-minute virtual workshop, participants discussed their projects in pairs, and developed Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound action plans. The group then reconvened to review two projects and reflect on the activity. Finally, participants completed a postworkshop survey. Thirty-four educators from 17 diverse specialties participated in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 Sailboat workshops. Pre- and postworkshop survey response rates were high (>90%). Participants indicated that they found the workshop valuable, highlighting that it helped them refine their project plans and organize their thoughts while fostering peer interaction. Responses to open-ended questions revealed that the workshop enhanced participants' understanding of the importance of iterative research planning. We observed significant increases from pre- to postworkshop (  < .05) in participants' confidence regarding identifying project barriers, weaknesses, key elements, alignment, and subsequent steps. The Sailboat activity is an effective, feasible opportunity for educators to critically appraise and refine Health Professions Education Research projects, even in virtual environments.

Overall, 112 patients were included, with 84 receiving RT and 28 FT as primary treatment. Median age and PSA were 68 years and 5.4 ng/mL, respectively. There was one rectal injury in the RT group. The overall 90-day complications were significantly higher in RT group (33% vs. 11%,   = 0.03). On multivariable analysis, history of RT and prolonged operative time were associated with a higher rate of 90-day complications. The 6- and 12-month continence rates were higher in FT group (50% vs. 20%,   = 0.02 and 69% vs. 33%,   = 0.03). Potency at 12 months was better preserved in FT group (46% vs. 12%,   = 0.01). On final sRRP pathology, the rates of grade group ≥ 4 (51% vs. 36%,   = 0.2), pT3 (69% vs. 75%,   = 0.6), positive nodes (30% vs. 18%,   = 0.2) and positive margins (33% vs. 39%,   = 0.5) were similar for RT versus FT, respectively. The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was 86% for RT versus 94% for FT (  = 0.6).  sRRP for recurrent PCa after FT is associated with lower complications and higher urinary continence and potency rates than patients who received primary RT.",

  "abstract": "Cervical cancer progresses through distinct precancerous stages, making early screening and intervention crucial for prevention. However, conventional screening modalities, such as cytology and HPV testing, face challenges related to sensitivity, specificity, and resource dependency. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), owing to their high stability and tissue-specific expression, have emerged as promising biomarkers, though their role in cervical carcinogenesis remains underexplored. In particular, the clinical utility of circRNAs for optimizing cervical cancer screening and early diagnosis has yet to be established. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic expression profiles of circRNAs across various stages of cervical cancer progression and identify potential biomarkers to enhance early detection. CircRNA sequencing was performed on cervical tissues spanning normal cervical epithelium (NCE), high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Functional assays, including cell viability, colony formation, and apoptosis, were performed to assess the oncogenic potential of circPOLD1 and its interaction with YBX1 in cervical cancer cells. BaseScope and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were applied to tissue microarrays for clincial validation and ROC curve analysis evaluated the diagnostic performance of circPOLD1 in serum as a liquid biopsy marker. CircRNA profiling revealed a progressive increase in circPOLD1 expression from NCE to HSIL and CSCC. Mechanistically, circPOLD1 functioned as an oncogene by binding to and phosphorylating YBX1, activating the AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α pathway to enhance glycolysis-driven tumorigenesis. BaseScope and IHC confirmed the stage-specific elevation of circPOLD1 and YBX1 in cervical lesions. The circPOLD1/YBX1 multi-marker panel demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, achieving an AUC of 0.951 for LSIL+ and 0.817 for HSIL+ detection. Furthermore, serum circPOLD1 levels exhibited a progressive increase across disease stages, underscoring its potential as a non-invasive biomarker. circPOLD1 and YBX1 synergistically drive cervical carcinogenesis and exhibit stage-specific expression patterns. Their combined detection significantly enhanced the accuracy for cervical cancer screening and dynamic monitoring. The successful application of BaseScope and IHC highlights the immediate translational potential of these biomarkers, paving the way for refined risk stratification, improved therapeutic targeting, and reduced cervical cancer burden through early intervention.",

  "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) is a rare but serious complication that poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. This article presents three cases of leptomeningeal involvement in patients with MM, highlighting the diverse clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies employed. The first case is a 54-year-old female who, after initial treatment and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant, developed CNS disease. Similarly, a 73-year-old female developed leptomeningeal involvement with progressive neurological symptoms. The third case describes a 63-year-old female with immunoglobulin (Ig)A lambda MM who developed CNS disease after treatment with daratumumab and radiation. In all three cases, leptomeningeal enhancement and atypical plasma cells were identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with treatment strategies including intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic therapy, radiation, and stem cell transplantation. Despite aggressive management, including novel agents and supportive care, all patients had poor outcomes, with two transitioning to hospice care. The article reviews the limited literature on CNS-MM, noting the lack of standardized treatment protocols and the need for further research. As the survival of MM patients improves, the incidence of CNS involvement is expected to rise, making the development of targeted therapies essential. These cases underscore the urgent need for further investigation into novel treatment options and the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management of CNS-MM.",

The advent of DNA microarrays enabled the utility of computational analyses in such management on a molecular basis.

The current study proposes a heuristic feature selection algorithm that identifies subsets of genes to almost perfectly classify glioma grades. The discretization technique in our method is a powerful tool against the tremendous data volume in DNA microarray. Instead of recognizing individual genetic features, the proposed algorithm helps identify specific gene subsets that play important roles in the pathogenesis of glioma.",

  "abstract": "The multifaceted roles and mechanisms of necroptosis in cancer cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that FGFR2 inhibition potently inhibits esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by inducing necroptosis in a RIP1/MLKL-dependent manner and show RIP3 is dispensable in this pathway. Notably, MST1 is identified as a necroptotic pathway component that interacts with RIP1 and MLKL to promote necroptosis by phosphorylating MLKL at Thr216. Additionally, FGFR2 inhibition induces Ser518 phosphorylation and triggers ubiquitin-mediated degradation of NF2, culminating in Hippo pathway suppression. Subsequently, YAP activation promotes RIP1 and MLKL transcriptional upregulation, further amplifying necroptosis. Intriguingly, IL-8 derived from necrotic cells stimulates peripheral surviving tumor cells to increase PD-L1 expression. Dual blockade of FGFR2/PD-L1 or FGFR2/IL-8-CXCR1/2 robustly impedes tumor growth in humanized mouse xenografts. Collectively, our findings delineate an alternative FGFR2-NF2-YAP signaling-dependent necroptotic pathway and shed light on the immunoregulatory role of FGFR2, offering promising avenues for combinatorial therapeutic strategies in clinical cancer management.",

  "abstract": "Nitraria berry, a traditional Chinese medicine, is harvested when ripe and then dried in the sun as medicine. Three species of Nitraria have attracted more attention in the pharmaceutical field: Nitraria tangutorum Bobr. (NT), Nitraria sibirica Pall. (NS) and Nitraria roborowskii Kom. (NR). However, the differences in chemical composition and the corresponding metabolic mechanisms of the three species of berries has not been reported. This study combined metabolomics and transcriptomics to explore the differences among three species of Nitraria berries. The results indicate that different metabolites (DMs) and different expressed genes (DEGs) are mainly enriched in the biosynthetic pathways of anthocyanins and flavonoids. 4 petunidins and 2 isorhamnetins were significantly accumulated in the NR, while 4 cyanidins and 3 kaempferols were significantly accumulated in the NS and NT. The transcriptomics results show that the biosynthesis of flavonoids (including anthocyanins) in Nitraria berry may be regulated by 10 structure genes, including 5 PAL, 2 4CL, CHI, 2 F3'H. Based on this, a network metabolic map for flavonoids was constructed, and a correlation analysis was performed between major DMs and DEGs. Overall, this study provides the theoretical basis and development suggestions for the comprehensive utilization and in-depth development of Nitraria berries.",

  "abstract": " Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the   gene, resulting in deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity and neurotoxic phenylalanine accumulation. Untreated PKU results in progressive neurodegeneration and severe intellectual disability. Neonatal screening has evolved from the Guthrie test to advanced techniques like HPLC, tandem mass spectrometry, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) for molecular confirmation. This study aimed to develop a rapid, scalable   genetic assay using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONTs) to enhance neonatal screening in high-prevalence regions like Türkiye, through accelerated, cost-effective genetic diagnostics.   An in-house panel was designed, implemented, and benchmarked against results obtained from the Illumina sequencing platform. A cohort of 40 PKU patients, previously diagnosed using Illumina platform, was selected for this study. Gene-specific primers were strategically designed to amplify exonic regions, untranslated segments, and exon-intron junctions of the   gene. Sequencing libraries were then prepared and processed using the MinION Mk1c instrument, with subsequent data analysis conducted through the Guppy software and complementary bioinformatics tools.   The findings showed complete agreement between the ONT and Illumina platforms, corroborating the high fidelity and reliability of the ONT-based assay. All pathogenic variants previously identified through Illumina sequencing were accurately detected, albeit with varying observed allele frequencies. Notably, the most prevalent variants identified in the patient cohort were NC_000012.12(NM_000277.3):c.1066-11G > A with a frequency of 37.5% and NC_000012.12(NM_000277.3):c.782G > A, at 15%.   The ONT-based single-gene testing for PKU demonstrated complete concordance with Illumina sequencing, validating its accuracy and reliability. This method effectively detects pathogenic variants and offers a faster, cost-effective solution for neonatal screening, particularly beneficial in high-prevalence regions like Türkiye.",

We conducted a retrospective registry review of pediatric patients (below 18 y) presenting to a single level-1 trauma center located in Seattle, Washington, from 2018 through 2023. PFI patients were compared with the otherwise injured patients by anatomic or physiological severity indices, such as injury severity score (ISS) and 3 types of age-adjusted shock index. The shock indices included shock index pediatric age-adjusted, pediatric shock index, and Advanced Trauma Life Support-based shock index (ATLS-SI). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of the need for transfusion or surgical intervention. Of 2610 total trauma patients, 230 (8.8%) were injured by firearms with a median age of 16.0 years (interquartile range: 14.0 to 17.0) and a male proportion of 80.4%. When compared with other injury mechanisms, PFI was associated with more frequent vascular injuries (PFI, 19.1% vs. others, 4.3%), transfusions (31.7% vs. 10.2%), and surgical interventions (23.5% vs. 6.7%). Among the age-adjusted shock indices, an elevated value of ATLS-SI showed the highest specificities for both outcomes [transfusion, 91.7% (95% CI: 86.3-95.5); surgical intervention, 83.5% (77.2-88.7)] and the strongest association with transfusion at an adjusted odds ratio of 4.84 (1.94-12.06). From this single-center experience, PFI patients are typically male adolescents, more frequently sustain major vascular injuries, and are more likely to require transfusion or surgery. An elevated ATLS-SI at emergency department (ED) arrival is specific for and predictive of the need for emergency care interventions.",

The common mutation types were frameshift mutations (n = 19), followed by nonsense (n = 20), splicing (n = 8), missense (n = 5), and whole exon deletion (n = 2). The overall survival rate was 98.2%, with an average follow-up duration of 59 months. Moreover, germline RB1 mutation's correlation with enucleation rates is less pronounced in unilateral cases (12.1%) compared to bilateral cases (65.5%). A total of 13 novel mutations have been identified, of which four are specifically associated with enucleation. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of RB1 germline mutations in a group of cases with Rb, leading to the identification of 13 novel mutations in Rb patients at a referral center in Iran. We expect that our findings will yield valuable insights to inform the management and genetic counseling of Rb patients, as well as their relatives who are at a higher risk.",

  "abstract": "Chronic prostatitis is a common urological disorder in young and middle-aged men, characterized by frequent relapses and an unknown etiology. We investigated the potential function of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) -related ligands in chronic prostatitis in the current study. In this study, we established the chronic experimental autoimmune prostatitis mouse model H&E staining was used to assess immune cell infiltration in prostate tissue, while RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses were performed to validate gene and protein expression differences across groups, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining was utilized to determine the spatial distribution of key proteins. Flow cytometry was conducted to analyze the proportions of immune cell populations in different experimental groups. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) was employed to knock down Igflr, and ELISA was used to measure cytokine levels in the peripheral blood of mice. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05, and all tests were conducted as two-tailed. Data analysis was performed using R software (version 4.2.2). We successful established the EAP model and discovered that the expression of IGF1R, content of IGF1-related ligands, was highest in prostate tissue and CD4  T cell subset. Furthermore, protein expression levels of IGF1R were also validated that upregulated in mouse prostate tissue. Colocalization of immunofluorescence suggested that IGF1R protein is highly expressed on CD4  T cells. Stimulation with desIGF1, a truncated analogue of IGF1, resulted in the significantly increased prostate inflammation and pain scores observed in the EAP+desIGF1 group mouse compared to other groups In vitro study further suggested that desIGF1 could increase the proportion of Th17 cells while decreasing the proportion of Treg cells. In the EAP+AAV-shIgf1r group, the knock down function of igf1r led to the alleviative prostate inflammation and response frequency of pain behavior test. We found that calcium ion associated pathways are active in EAP by bioinformatics, and further validated that PKC-β protein with significantly increased expression noted in the EAP+desIGF1 group, and decreased in the EAP+AAV-shIgf1r group. We also found that the proportion of Th17 cells increased after activation of PKC- β by flow cytometry. These findings support that PKC-β associated pathways mediated by IGF1/IGF1R axis may impact Th17 cell differentiation and exacerbating prostate inflammation in EAP mouse, providing new molecular targets for the clinical therapeutic strategy.",

  "abstract": "Urinary tract infection (UTI) of the urinary bladder is a common bacterial infection that predominantly affects women, with many experiencing recurrent episodes. Recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) are associated with significant physical, psychological, and social difficulties. Further, they are closely related to lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). LUTD affects bladder function and structure, thereby contributing to urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence, which, in turn, increases the risk of recurrent infections due to impaired urothelial defense mechanisms. The current study explored the pathophysiology of LUTD in women with rUTIs. Potential treatments for rUTIs include long-term prophylactic antibiotics, probiotics, D-mannose, vaccines, small molecule inhibitors, and stem cell therapy. Moreover, it evaluated the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy as a treatment modality for LUTD. PRP has regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, it can be a promising option for enhancing urothelial barrier integrity and reducing infection recurrence. Repeated intravesical PRP injections are effective in improving bladder symptoms and decreasing UTI recurrences by enhancing the proliferative ability of the urothelium in patients with rUTIs. Further, this review examined the potential predictors of successful PRP treatment outcomes such as cytokine and urothelial biomarker levels, which provided insights into patient selection and individualized treatment strategies. Identifying the predictive biomarkers of treatment responsiveness is essential for optimizing PRP therapy. Hence, to improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients with rUTIs, future research should focus on refining the use of PRP, exploring combination therapies, and validating biomarkers.",

  "abstract": "Penile fracture (PF) is a urological emergency that can lead to significant complications if not treated promptly and understanding the factors influencing complications and outcomes in PFs is crucial for improving patient management. This study aims to evaluate the impact of various factors on postoperative complications and outcomes in patients with PFs based on 10 years of experience at a single center. In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from 106 patients who underwent surgical treatment for PFs between 2013 and 2023 at our institution. Patient demographics, fracture characteristics, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Factors affecting complications including the timing of surgery, defect size were evaluated. The study revealed that early surgical intervention significantly reduced the risk of complications. Factors such as larger defect size and delayed surgery were associated with higher rates of postoperative complications. The mean age of the participants was 46.3 ± 13.9 years. The primary causes of PFs were sexual intercourse (62.3%), masturbation (19.8%), forced penile bending (11.3%), rolling over in bed (4.7%), and falling from bed (1.8%). The mean time from trauma to surgery was 10.5 ± 8 hours, with a mean defect size of 12.7 ± 5.5 mm. Postoperative complications included penile curvature, palpable plaques, and painful erections, with rates of 10.4%, 39.6%, and 23.6%, respectively. International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores significantly decreased from preoperative (21.36 ± 2.9) to postoperative values at 6 months (19.48 ± 3.7) (  < 0.001). The time from trauma to surgery significantly correlated with the change in IIEF-5 scores between preoperative and postoperative values (  = 0.007,     = 0.067). The group experiencing complications exhibited a mean defect size of 14.54 ± 6 mm, whereas the non-complication group had a mean defect size of 11.07 ± 4.5 mm (  < 0.001). The findings suggest that timely surgical intervention and careful assessment of defect size are critical in managing PFs and these insights can guide urologists in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study benefits from a substantial sample size and a decade of surgical experience at a single center. However, the study's retrospective design and unknown patient history with erectogenic drugs are limitations. The timing of surgery significantly impacts IIEF-5 scores, while the size of the defect was associated with other postoperative complications; understanding the factors influencing complications in PFs can improve surgical outcomes.",

  "abstract": "The gut microbiota and its metabolites are bi-directionally associated with various human illnesses, which has received extensive attention. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota metabolite produced in the liver, which may serve the role of an \"axis\" connecting the gut and host organs. TMAO levels are significantly higher in the blood of individuals with cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and metabolic diseases. Endothelial cells are crucial for regulating microcirculation and maintaining tissue and organ barriers and are widely recognized as target cells for TMAO. TMAO not only induces endothelial dysfunction but also acts on various cell types, such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, nerve cells, and pancreatic cells, triggering multiple cell death mechanisms, including necrosis and programmed cell death, thereby influencing host health. This paper thoroughly covers the origins, production, and metabolic pathways of TMAO, emphasizing its importance in the early detection and prognosis of human diseases in the \"Gut-Organ\" axis, as well as its mechanisms of influence on human diseases, particularly the cross-talk with cell death. Furthermore, we cover recent advances in treating human diseases by regulating gut microbiota structure and enzyme activity to influence TMAO metabolism and reduce TMAO levels, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiplatelet drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and natural products.",

  "abstract": "Traditional pathological diagnosis methods have limitations in terms of interobserver variability and the time consumption of evaluations. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using whole-slide images (WSIs) to establish a deep learning model for the diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We retrospectively collected pathological data from 95 patients with ccRCC from January 2023 to December 2023. All pathological slices conforming to the standards of the model were manually annotated first. The WSIs were preprocessed to extract the region of interest. The WSIs were divided into a training set and a test set, and the ratio of tumor slices to normal tissue slices in the training set to the test set was 3:1. Positive and negative samples were randomly extracted. Model training was based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a random forest model. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by generating a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A total of 663 pathological slices from 95 patients with ccRCC were collected. The mean number of slices per patient was 7.6 ± 2.7 (range: 3-17), with 506 tumor slices and 157 normal tissue slices. There were 200 tumor slices and 74 normal slices in the training set, and a total of 200,870 small images were extracted. There were 250 tumor slices and 63 normal slices in the test set, and a total of 39,211 small images were extracted. According to the CNN model and random forest model trained with the training set, 11 pathological slices in the test set were identified as false normal slices, and six pathological slices were identified as false tumor slices. The total accuracy was 94.6% (296/313), the precision rate was 97.6% (239/245), and the recall rate was 95.6% (239/250). The generated probabilistic heatmaps were consistent with the manually annotated pathological images. The ROC curve results revealed that the area under curve (AUC) reached 0.9658 (95% confidence interval: 0.9603-0.9713), the specificity was 90.5%, and the sensitivity was 95.6%. The use of a deep learning method for the diagnosis of ccRCC is feasible. The ccRCC model established in this study achieved high accuracy. AI-based diagnostic methods for ccRCC may improve diagnostic efficiency.",

This study aimed to develop an objective resource optimization tool to rank clinical service needs to assign internal medicine pharmacist resources at a community hospital within an academic medical center health system. Additionally, this study aimed to collect and analyze physician expert opinion to supplement the pharmacist-developed tool.   A pharmacist expert panel was convened to determine patient characteristics necessitating additional pharmacist services. Retrospective electronic health record data were aggregated by patient characteristic categories and ranked by clinical services. Separately, a survey of attending physicians rated patient cases on the need for additional pharmacy services and provided rationale. Results of both panels were analyzed and compared to develop and strengthen the tool.   The pharmacist-developed tool included three patient characteristic categories: Patient Acuity, Critical Drug Monitoring, and Transitions of Care. An internal medicine teaching service scored highest for needing additional pharmacy services; surgery and urology resulted in lowest scores. Highest ranked cases surveyed by physicians were patients with more complex transitions of care, inpatient medication management, and disease state optimization. Comparing panels, 92.5% of physician comments were related to one of the three categories included in the pharmacist developed tool. Remaining comments fell within a new category, Patient Allergies.   Pharmacists and physicians identified similar patient characteristic categories requiring more robust pharmacist services across internal medicine patients. Alignment of the two panels confirms the inputs used to develop the tool and increases confidence in its application for pharmacist resource optimization.",

  "abstract": "Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) has been proposed as an alternative to ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance; however, comparative data for AMRI and ultrasound are needed. Thus, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-AMRI and ultrasound for early-stage HCC detection in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a multicenter retrospective case-control study among patients with cirrhosis (cases with early-stage HCC as per Milan Criteria; controls without HCC) who underwent an ultrasound and a DCE-MRI within a 6-month period between 2012 and 2019. HCC diagnosis was confirmed by imaging alone in 85% and by histopathology in 15% of patients. Dynamic AMRI examinations were simulated from the full MRI by selecting relevant sequences. Independent, blinded interpretations of ultrasounds and AMRI results were performed using Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System algorithms. Ultrasounds were considered positive if US-3 observations were detected. AMRI was considered positive if LR-4, LR-5, or LR-M were detected. Per-patient sensitivity and specificity for early-stage HCC detection were estimated, and cross-modality differences were tested. We included 216 cases and 432 controls. Patient-level sensitivity and specificity of AMRI were significantly higher compared with ultrasound: 80.1% (95% CI 76.1-83.6)   71.1% (95% CI 66.6-75.2),   <0.001, and 91.9% (95% CI 89.9-93.5)   72.3% (95% CI 69.3-75.2),   <0.001, respectively. AMRI sensitivity was significantly higher compared with ultrasound among patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (80.8%   57.4%,   <0.001) but not among those with Child-Pugh A (84.7%   78.6%,   = 0.07) or Child-Pugh C cirrhosis (52.6%   68.4%,   = 0.18). Dynamic AMRI may be more sensitive and specific for early-stage HCC detection in patients with cirrhosis compared with ultrasound, although its relative benefit might be smaller in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Larger direct comparative data sets are needed, particularly among patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis who may benefit from alternative surveillance strategies. Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) is increasingly recognized as an alternative to ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance. However, existing data are limited by single-center samples, spectrum bias, and lack of comparative data for AMRI   ultrasound. We found that AMRI had significantly higher per-patient sensitivity and specificity compared with ultrasound for the detection of early-stage HCC, although its relative benefit might be smaller in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and both modalities underperformed in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. If sufficiently validated, AMRI could be adopted into practice guidelines for HCC surveillance and serve as a preferred alternative in select subgroups of patients.",

Both versions exhibit high sensitivity, with Chigene V2 achieving nearly 100% RNA coverage and detecting over 1800 genes per cell on average. Targeted capture of single-cell gene mutations enhances mutation detection sensitivity. Moreover, this Chigene V2 platform is validated in clinical samples for its ability to detect mutations, gene fusions, and alternative splicing. The reliability of the platform is further corroborated via known functional gene mutation (CDKN1A) and fusion (FGFR3-TACC). To validate this method's potential for discovering novel gene mutations in clinical samples, the investigation revealed an intriguing cell subpopulation carrying an ARHGAP5 mutation in urothelial carcinoma. These cells exhibited high-frequency mRNA splicing and exhibited specific crosstalk with T cells, distinguishing them from the subpopulation with the ARHGAP5 wild-type phenotype. Overall, this method provides a robust scRNA-seq platform suitable for comprehensive analyses of clinical specimens at different genetic information levels, thereby offering significant potential in the discovery of novel genes and interactions at the single-cell level.",

  "abstract": "We tested whether a commercially available, wearable bladder ultrasound device (DFree , Triple W Japan Inc.) could accurately estimate bladder volume in children with urologic conditions by comparing sensor readings to instilled volume during cystometrography (CMG). We prospectively enrolled 40 children (6 months to 18 years old). The device was taped to the suprapubic region and volume measurements obtained during CMG. Primary outcome was device accuracy, defined as device indicating ≥ 8 (0-10 scale) when the instilled volume was ≥ 80% of CMG-determined capacity. Mixed effects linear regression modeled the relationship between sensor indication and instilled volume after adjusting for clinical variables. Median age was 7.2 years, 20 (50%) were male, 27 (67.5%) were on clean intermittent catheterization, 30 (75%) had spina bifida. The sensor accurately measured capacity in 46.2% of patients with a sensitivity of 0.70, specificity of 0.13, positive predictive value of 0.53, and negative predictive value of 0.22. Device readings were statistically associated with instilled volume; single-digit (10%) increase in sensor reading was associated with an average increase of 10% (95% CI: 9% to 12%, p < 0.001) in bladder volume. A commercially available, wearable ultrasound bladder sensor accurately measured bladder capacity in 46.2% of children undergoing UDS. Our findings caution clinicians in recommending these types of direct-to-consumer devices. Repeated measures testing is needed to determine if the accurate device indicators observed in a minority of patients herein, are reproducible.

  "abstract": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious inflammatory complication that can arise after allogeneic transplantation, characterized by donor T-cells attacking the recipient's tissues. While cardiac complications are infrequent, they are more commonly observed in cases of chronic GVHD and may manifest as pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, and various arrhythmias. Additionally, chronic GVHD can result in constrictive pericarditis (CP) due to the accumulation of fluid and scarring. A 25-year-old Iranian man developed CP 14 years after undergoing allogenic stem cell transplantation. Following inadequate response to medical therapy, he underwent a pericardiectomy. Pathological examination during follow-up revealed fibrosis and mild chronic inflammation. This report aims to add another case of cardiac manifestation associated with GVHD to the current literature. The main message emphasizes the urgent need for prompt diagnosis and effective pericardiectomy, which can be life-saving. Surgical referral should always be an option, and post-operative immunomodulation is crucial.",

A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using the keyword \"Kegel exercises\" on YouTube. The top 100 videos were screened, and 60 met the inclusion criteria. Videos were evaluated using the Kegel Video Evaluation Score (KVES) and the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Video metrics such as duration, views, likes, and comments were recorded, and statistical analyses were performed to assess correlations and inter-rater reliability. The mean KVES and GQS scores were 17.26 ± 4.38 and 3.36 ± 1.09, respectively, with 60% of videos categorized as high quality. Nonphysician health professionals uploaded the highest-quality videos for instructional content. A strong correlation between KVES and GQS was observed (Spearman's ρ = 0.924, p < 0.001), validating the evaluation tool. Video duration positively impacted content comprehensiveness, while views and likes did not correlate with quality. In contrast to previous studies highlighting low-quality medical content on YouTube, this study shows that high-quality Kegel exercise videos are prevalent, suggesting their potential as reliable educational resources.

  "abstract": "Intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely utilized for high-resolution imaging of coronary arteries, typically requiring contrast agents to displace blood from the imaging field. However, the use of contrast media poses increased risk, especially in patients with impaired renal function and heart failure. This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) as a flushing medium for a novel fast-pullback, high-frequency OCT (HF-OCT) imaging system. This observational study included HF-OCT imaging of 52 coronary arteries from 21 patients with stable coronary artery disease. Imaging was performed using either a contrast agent (iohexol 350) or LRS as the flushing medium. Clear image length (CIL), defined as the segment with a visible lumen-to-vessel wall boundary over at least 270°, was compared between the two groups. Quantitative and qualitative OCT image analyses were also obtained and compared between the contrast and LRS groups. A total of 52 paired HF-OCT imaging data sets were analyzed. CIL (mm) and CIL (%) were found to be similar between the contrast and the LRS groups (median 81.0 mm, interquartile range [IQR] 74.5-92.0 vs. median 79.2 mm, IQR 68.8-89.6, p = 0.526 and median 100%, IQR 100-100 vs. median 100, IQR 99-100, respectively). Quantitative OCT parameters, that is, minimum lumen area and diameter, were found to be comparable between the two groups (median 2.75 mm², IQR 1.85-4.48, vs. 2.85 mm², IQR 2.03-4.58, p = 0.654, and median 1.85 mm, IQR 1.53-2.40, vs. 1.90 mm, IQR 1.60-2.40, p = 0.651, respectively). Qualitative OCT findings, such as presence of a lipid-rich plaque, thin-cap fibroatheroma, and macrophages, were equally visualized using both flushing media. OCT imaging using LRS as a flushing medium is safe and effective and can reduce the amount of contrast agent required while maintaining comparable lesion assessment quality to contrast-based OCT imaging.",

Transpapillary cholangioscopy can potentially be used to diagnose GB lesions; however, the images obtained remain unclear. This study aimed to characterize the endoscopic findings of GB lesions. We examined the endoscopic features of GB lesions in 50 consecutive patients who underwent cholecystectomy. GB specimens were obtained immediately following cholecystectomy, opened on the side opposite the liver bed, and flushed with saline solution. Each lesion was assessed using a high-resolution endoscope equipped with white light and narrow-band imaging magnification. For elevated lesions, both the surface structure (classified as regular, irregular, or absent) and vascular structure (dilation, meandering, caliber change, non-uniformity, and loose vessel areas) were assessed. Twelve of the 50 patients had elevated lesions, including cholesterol polyp (  = 4), hyperplastic polyp (  = 1), xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (  = 1), and GB carcinoma (  = 6). Advanced GB carcinoma, as opposed to T1 GB carcinoma, demonstrated a papillary surface with destructive areas and neovascularization on narrow-band imaging magnification. Endoscopic images of each GB lesion were characterized, and the differences between GB carcinomas and benign lesions were identified. This preliminary classification may contribute to innovative imaging diagnosis and targeted biopsy for diagnosing GB lesions under direct vision.",

  "abstract": "Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have been widely tested in their performance on various examinations, with limited data on their performance in clinical scenarios. The role of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) (OpenAI, San Francisco, California, United States) and Gemini Advanced (Google LLC, Mountain View, California, United States) in multiple aspects of gastroenterology including answering patient questions, providing medical advice, and as tools to potentially assist healthcare providers has shown some promise, though associated with many limitations. We aimed to study the performance of ChatGPT-4.0, ChatGPT-3.5, and Gemini Advanced across 20 clinicopathologic scenarios in the unexplored realm of gastrointestinal pathology. Materials and methods Twenty clinicopathological scenarios in gastrointestinal pathology were provided to these three large language models. Two fellowship-trained pathologists independently assessed their responses, evaluating both the diagnostic accuracy and confidence of the models. The results were then compared using the chi-squared test. The study also evaluated each model's ability in four key areas, namely, (1) ability to provide differential diagnoses, (2) interpretation of immunohistochemical stains, (3) ability to deliver a concise final diagnosis, (4) and explanation provided for the thought process, using a five-point scoring system. The mean, median score±standard deviation (SD), and interquartile ranges were calculated. A comparative analysis of these four parameters across ChatGPT-4.0, ChatGPT-3.5, and Gemini Advanced was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Other parameters evaluated were the ability to provide a tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage and the incidence of pseudo-references \"hallucinations\" while citing reference material. Results Gemini Advanced (diagnostic accuracy: p=0.01; providing differential diagnosis: p=0.03) and ChatGPT-4.0 (interpretation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains: p=0.001; providing differential diagnosis: p=0.002) performed significantly better in certain realms than ChatGPT-3.5, indicating continuously improving data training sets. However, the mean performances of ChatGPT-4.0 and Gemini Advanced ranged between 3.0 and 3.7 and were at best classified as average. None of the models could provide the accurate TNM staging for these clinical scenarios, with 25-50% citing references that do not exist (hallucinations). Conclusion This study indicated that though these models are evolving, they need human supervision and definite improvements before being used in clinical medicine. This is the first study of its kind in gastrointestinal pathology to the best of our knowledge.",

However, one specialty that particularly requires data on LLM use is gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery, a gap we sought to address in our research. Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems like LLMs have demonstrated the ability to mimic human communication, assist in diagnosis, provide patient education, and support medical research simultaneously. Despite these advantages, challenges such as biases, data privacy concerns, and lack of transparency in decision-making remain critical. The role of regulations in mitigating these risks is widely debated, with proponents advocating for structured oversight to enhance trust and patient safety, while others caution against potential barriers to innovation. Rather than replacing human expertise, AI should be integrated thoughtfully to complement clinical decision-making.

  "abstract": "The preservation of the pelvic autonomic nervous system in total mesorectal excision remains challenging to date. The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study.

  "abstract": "The gut microbiota and its metabolites are bi-directionally associated with various human illnesses, which has received extensive attention. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a gut microbiota metabolite produced in the liver, which may serve the role of an \"axis\" connecting the gut and host organs. TMAO levels are significantly higher in the blood of individuals with cardiovascular, renal, neurological, and metabolic diseases. Endothelial cells are crucial for regulating microcirculation and maintaining tissue and organ barriers and are widely recognized as target cells for TMAO. TMAO not only induces endothelial dysfunction but also acts on various cell types, such as endothelial cells, epithelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, nerve cells, and pancreatic cells, triggering multiple cell death mechanisms, including necrosis and programmed cell death, thereby influencing host health. This paper thoroughly covers the origins, production, and metabolic pathways of TMAO, emphasizing its importance in the early detection and prognosis of human diseases in the \"Gut-Organ\" axis, as well as its mechanisms of influence on human diseases, particularly the cross-talk with cell death. Furthermore, we cover recent advances in treating human diseases by regulating gut microbiota structure and enzyme activity to influence TMAO metabolism and reduce TMAO levels, including the use of probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiplatelet drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and natural products.",

However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

  "abstract": "After neoadjuvant therapy, pathologic analysis of rectal cancer resected specimens may show a complete response in the primary tissue cancer with residual tumor in the lymph nodes (ypT0N+). The aim of this study was to describe the 5-year overall survival and factors associated with survival of ypT0N+ patients with rectal cancer who had neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and to compare these patients' survival with patients in other pathologic categories. We conducted a retrospective analysis. We used the National Cancer Database. We identified patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total neoadjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery between 2006 and 2016. Besides ypT0N+, 5 pathologic categories were identified: ypT0N0, ypT1-2N0, ypT3-4N0, ypT1-2N+, and ypT3-4N+. The primary outcome measure was 5-year overall survival. We included 30,751 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A total of 342 patients developed ypT0N+, of whom 181 (52.9%) received total neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients who received total neoadjuvant therapy, developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, ypT0N+ disease was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between ypT0N+ and ypT3-4N0 or ypT1-2N+. Similar findings were noticed among patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ypT0N+, older age, male gender, and higher number of positive lymph nodes were all associated with a decrease in the overall survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study, lack of variables describing the chemotherapy and radiation regimens used, and paucity of data on disease-specific survival or recurrence. Developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, it was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+.

  "abstract": "Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) has been proposed as an alternative to ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance; however, comparative data for AMRI and ultrasound are needed. Thus, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-AMRI and ultrasound for early-stage HCC detection in patients with cirrhosis. We conducted a multicenter retrospective case-control study among patients with cirrhosis (cases with early-stage HCC as per Milan Criteria; controls without HCC) who underwent an ultrasound and a DCE-MRI within a 6-month period between 2012 and 2019. HCC diagnosis was confirmed by imaging alone in 85% and by histopathology in 15% of patients. Dynamic AMRI examinations were simulated from the full MRI by selecting relevant sequences. Independent, blinded interpretations of ultrasounds and AMRI results were performed using Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System algorithms. Ultrasounds were considered positive if US-3 observations were detected. AMRI was considered positive if LR-4, LR-5, or LR-M were detected. Per-patient sensitivity and specificity for early-stage HCC detection were estimated, and cross-modality differences were tested. We included 216 cases and 432 controls. Patient-level sensitivity and specificity of AMRI were significantly higher compared with ultrasound: 80.1% (95% CI 76.1-83.6)   71.1% (95% CI 66.6-75.2),   <0.001, and 91.9% (95% CI 89.9-93.5)   72.3% (95% CI 69.3-75.2),   <0.001, respectively. AMRI sensitivity was significantly higher compared with ultrasound among patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis (80.8%   57.4%,   <0.001) but not among those with Child-Pugh A (84.7%   78.6%,   = 0.07) or Child-Pugh C cirrhosis (52.6%   68.4%,   = 0.18). Dynamic AMRI may be more sensitive and specific for early-stage HCC detection in patients with cirrhosis compared with ultrasound, although its relative benefit might be smaller in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Larger direct comparative data sets are needed, particularly among patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis who may benefit from alternative surveillance strategies. Abbreviated MRI (AMRI) is increasingly recognized as an alternative to ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance. However, existing data are limited by single-center samples, spectrum bias, and lack of comparative data for AMRI   ultrasound. We found that AMRI had significantly higher per-patient sensitivity and specificity compared with ultrasound for the detection of early-stage HCC, although its relative benefit might be smaller in patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and both modalities underperformed in patients with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis. If sufficiently validated, AMRI could be adopted into practice guidelines for HCC surveillance and serve as a preferred alternative in select subgroups of patients.",

  "abstract": "Systemic inflammation contributes to the progression of malignancies. The preoperative lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio has recently been shown to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery, but its prognostic value remains unclear in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. This study aimed to examine the prognostic values of inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, focusing on the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. This is a retrospective study from a prospectively collected database. This study was conducted at a high-volume multidisciplinary tertiary cancer center in Japan. The subjects were 756 consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who received systemic chemotherapy from 2000 to 2015. The prognostic value of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was evaluated by univariable and multivariable analyses. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to compare the prognostic impact of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio with the impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, or the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score. The primary outcomes measured were the correlations of prognostic scores with overall survival. Median survival times of patients with high, intermediate, and low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratios were 29.4, 19.3, and 13.1 months (p < 0.001). In all subgroups according to key prognostic factors (performance status, use of targeted agents, pretreatment CEA levels, tumor sidedness, M category, and primary tumor resection), patient prognosis could be clearly stratified into 3 groups by the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was independently associated with reduced survival (low vs high: HR 1.96, p < 0.001; intermediate vs high: HR 1.44, p < 0.001). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was the most sensitive predictor of survival among all inflammation-based prognostic scores on a continuous basis. This study was retrospective in nature. The lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio is a useful prognostic biomarker for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer and could contribute to accurate prognostication and therapeutic decision making.

Recientemente se ha demostrado que la proporción preoperatoria de linfocitos -proteína C reactiva predice la supervivencia de los pacientes con cáncer colorrectal que se sometieron a cirugía, pero su valor pronóstico sigue sin estar claro en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronostico de los scores inflamtorios centrandose en linfocito- proteina c reactiva en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal metastásico.DISEÑO:Estudio retrospective evaluando una base de datos.AJUSTE:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un centro oncológico terciario multidisciplinario de gran volumen en Japón.PACIENTES:Se incluyeron 756 pacientes consecutivos todos con cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable que recibieron quimioterapia sistémica de 2000 a 2015. El valor pronóstico de la proteína C reactiva se evaluó mediante análisis univariables y multivariables. Se realizó análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo para comparar el impacto pronóstico de la proteína linfocito-C-reactiva con el de la proporción de neutrófilos a linfocitos, la proporción de plaquetas a linfocitos, la proporción de linfocitos a monocitos o la proporción de puntuación pronóstica segun escala de Glasgow modificada.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Correlacion de las puntuaciones pronósticas con la supervivencia global.RESULTADOS:La mediana de supervivencia de los pacientes con niveles altos, intermedios y bajos de proteína C reactiva de linfocitos fue de 29,4, 19,3 y 13,1 meses, respectivamente (p <0,001). En todos los subgrupos de acuerdo con los factores pronósticos clave (estado funcional, uso de agentes dirigidos, niveles de antígeno carcinoembrionario antes del tratamiento, lado del tumor, categoría M y resección del tumor primario), el pronóstico del paciente podría estratificarse claramente en tres grupos por linfocito a C- proteína reactiva. El análisis multivariable reveló que la disminución de linfocitos a proteína C reactiva se asoció de forma independiente con una supervivencia reducida (baja frente a alta: cociente de riesgo 1,96, p <0,001; intermedio frente a alto: cociente de riesgo 1,44, p <0,001). El análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo reveló que de linfocito a proteína C reactiva era el predictor de supervivencia más sensible entre todas las puntuaciones de pronóstico basadas en inflamación de forma continua.LIMITACIONES:Este estudio fue de naturaleza retrospectiva.CONCLUSIONES:La proteína C reactiva de linfocitos a C es un biomarcador pronóstico útil para el cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable y podría contribuir a un pronóstico preciso y a la toma de decisiones terapéuticas.

  "abstract": "People with HIV are up to 100 times more likely to develop anal carcinoma compared to the general population. Diagnosing and treating precursor lesions, specifically high-grade anal dysplasia, can significantly reduce the risk of developing anal carcinoma. This S2k-guideline outlines the factors that increase the likelihood of developing anal carcinoma and its precursors, including advancing age, a low CD4  T-lymphocyte nadir, active cigarette smoking, receptive anal intercourse, or persistent infection with high-risk (HR) types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Screening is primarily recommended for all men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women with HIV starting at age 35, and all people with HIV starting at age 45. After inspection and digital anorectal examination, anal cytology is collected. An HR-HPV test may be performed. If clinical abnormalities are present or if cytology shows \"ASC-US or worse\", a referral for high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is indicated. If lesions are found during HRA, a biopsy should be obtained. Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grade-III or AIN-II p16-positive correspond to high-grade dysplasia and require treatment. The most strongly recommended therapeutic options are electrocautery, 85% trichloroacetic acid, and surgical excision. Finally, the guideline discusses how these screening recommendations can be applied to individuals without HIV.",

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

  "abstract": "Investigative work in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma is rapidly growing with the advent of immunotherapy. Nonetheless, trial endpoints, and more importantly, clinically meaningful endpoints need to be accurately chosen depending on the phase of trial and the patient population studied. We provide a scoping review focusing on trial endpoints on the use of immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for prospective phase II and III trials using immunotherapy, whether in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, bridging, downstaging, or palliative settings, while discussing the clinical implications of trial endpoints. The field of immune oncology is rapidly progressing and has become the standard of care in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of early and intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma has yet to be defined. Prospective trials for all stages of disease must strive for endpoints that are not only statistically significant but also clinically consequential. Whereas overall response rate may be a reasonable trial endpoint in phase II trials, phase III trials should rather aim for the improvement of overall survival or quality of life to have clinically meaningful impacts.",

  "abstract": "Health care costs and wait times for colorectal cancer treatment are increasing in Canada, but the association between the 2 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between wait times and health care costs and utilization. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study. This study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014 were sorted and ranked into quintiles based on the time from index contact for a colorectal cancer-related symptom to first treatment. The primary outcome is risk-adjusted health care costs, and the secondary outcomes include health care utilization and overall mortality. We included a total of 6936 patients. Total wait times ranged between 0 and 762 days. In comparison with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly increased costs (short: mean cost ratio 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32; moderate: mean cost ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; long: mean cost ratio 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.64; and very long: mean cost ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Compared with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly lower risk of mortality (short: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; moderate: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80; long: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; very long: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85). The median number of pretreatment radiological and endoscopic investigations and surgeon clinic visits increased over the study period across all wait time categories. This is a nonrandomized, retrospective cohort study with potentially limited generalizability. Patients with very short and short wait times are likely those diagnosed with life-threatening complications of colorectal cancer. Outside this window, patients with longer wait times experience increased health care costs and utilization with similar overall mortality. Improved care coordination and patient navigation may help contain the increasing wait times and associated increasing health care costs and utilization.

  "abstract": "Early detection of postoperative recurrence is beneficial for patients with cancer; however, optimal surveillance remains an issue. To optimize the follow-up plan, the estimation of an individual patient's risk of recurrence is indispensable. This study aimed to establish a statistical model for predicting the risk of organ-specific recurrence after curative resection of colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral hospital. This study included 1720 patients with colon cancer treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical charts. The risk score was developed using a competing risk model in a derivation cohort (973 patients treated in 1997-2009) and then validated in a validation cohort (747 patients treated in 2010-2015). Patients who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon cancer were included. The prediction of the incidence of postoperative liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer was measured. The factors selected for the prediction model for liver metastasis included differentiation, T category, venous invasion, N category, and preoperative CEA level. The model for lung metastasis included sex, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, N category, preoperative CEA level, and malignant bowel obstruction. During external validation, the area under the curve at 60 months was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for liver metastasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.81) for lung metastasis. The generalizability of the model to different healthcare settings remains to be elucidated. We developed a prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence in the liver and lung after curative resection of colon cancer, which demonstrated good discrimination ability in the external validation cohort. Our model can aid clinicians and patients in customizing postoperative surveillance according to an individual patient's risk of organ-specific recurrence.

Este estudio incluyó 1720 pacientes con cáncer de colon tratados en el Hospital de la Universidad de Tokio entre 1997 y 2015. Los datos se recuperaron retrospectivamente de las historias clinicas de los pacientes. La puntuación de riesgo fué desarrollada utilizando un modelo de riesgo competitivo en cohortes de derivación (973 pacientes tratados en 1997-2009) y luego se lo validó en cohortes de validación (747 pacientes tratados en 2010-2015). Todos aquellos casos que se sometieron a una resección curativa de cáncer de colon en estadio I-III RESULTADOS PRINCIPLES:: La predicción de la incidencia de metástasis hepáticas y pulmonares postoperatorias del cáncer de colon. Los factores seleccionados para el modelo de predicción de metástasis hepáticas incluyeron diferenciación tumoral, categoría T, invasión venosa, categoría N y nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio. El modelo de predicción de metástasis pulmonar incluyó el sexo del paciente, la invasión linfática, la invasión venosa, la categoría N, el nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio y la obstrucción intestinal maligna. Durante la validación externa, el área inferior de la curva a 60 meses fue de 0,78 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,71 a 0,84) para las metástasis hepáticas y de 0,72 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,64 a 0,81) para las metástasis pulmonares. La generalización del presente modelo a diferentes entornos de atención en salud aún no ha podido ser dilucidado. Desarrollamos un modelo de predicción para estimar el riesgo de recurrencia en el hígado y el pulmón después de resección curativa de cáncer de colon, éste modelo demostró una buena capacidad de discriminación en las cohortes de validación externa. El modelo puede ayudar a médicos y pacientes a personalizar la vigilancia postoperatoria de acuerdo con el riesgo individual de recurrencia específica en un órgano específico.

  "abstract": "There have been significant advances in the locoregional and systemic therapy landscape for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with the most notable being the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations. ICI combinations have significantly improved the overall survival of patients with unresectable HCC, affording median survival over 2 years and long-term survival exceeding 5 years in a subset of patients. Accordingly, there has been increased interest in the earlier application of systemic therapies, including (neo)adjuvant therapy in the peri-operative setting or in combination with intra-arterial therapies. However, recent data failed to demonstrate improved recurrence-free survival with use of adjuvant ICI therapy. Conversely, two trials showed improved progression-free-survival when ICI therapies were combined with transarterial chemoembolization, although data regarding the impact on overall survival are still immature. These improved outcomes raise several new questions including which patients with liver-localized HCC should receive systemic therapy, how should this be sequenced or combined with other available therapies, and how to manage those patients with marked responses, including consideration of liver transplantation. These questions are often determined on a case-by-case basis and best made in a multidisciplinary manner, considering several factors including tumor burden, degree of liver dysfunction, performance status, and patient's long-term goals of care.",

  "abstract": "Biopsies are routinely obtained in the workup of large colorectal polyps before endoscopic resection. This study aimed to examine how reliable biopsies are in terms of reflecting the true histopathology of large colorectal polyps, in the clinical routine. This is a retrospective study. Data from patients undergoing polypectomy of large colorectal polyps at the endoscopy unit, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, between January 2014 and December 2016 were scrutinized. A total of 485 colorectal lesions were biopsied within 1 year before complete endoscopic removal. Biopsy-obtained specimens were compared with completely resected specimens in terms of concordance and discordance and if the final result was upgraded or downgraded. The primary outcome measured was the concordance between biopsy-obtained specimens and completely resected specimens. Median lesion size was 3 cm (range 1-11). In 189 cases (39%), biopsies did not provide a correct dysplastic grade compared with final pathology after complete resection. One hundred forty-three cases (29%) and 46 cases (9%) were upgraded and downgraded. The percentage of cases with discordant biopsy results was 40% in cases with 1 biopsy taken and 38% in cases where multiple biopsies had been sampled. Time from biopsy to complete resection did not influence the erroneous outcome of biopsies. Notably, the percentage of discordant biopsy results was 37% and 35% in lesions measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm. However, this percentage increased to 48% in colorectal lesions larger than 4 cm. This study was designed to reflect the clinical routine, the number of biopsies obtained and forceps technique were hence not standardized, which constitutes a limitation. This study demonstrates that cancer-negative forceps biopsies of large colorectal polyps, referred for endoscopic resection, are not reliable. Considering that endoscopic resection of lesions containing superficial cancer is plausible, the clinical value of forceps biopsies in lesions suitable for endoscopic resection is questionable.

Analizar que tan confiables son las biopsias en cuanto a reflejar la verdadera histopatología de los pólipos colorrectales grandes, en la rutina clínica. DISEÑO:: Este es un estudio retrospectivo. Los datos de pacientes sometidos a polipectomía de pólipos colorrectales grandes en la unidad de endoscopia, en Skåne University Hospital Malmö, entre enero de 2014 y diciembre de 2016 fueron examinados. Un total de 485 lesiones colorrectales se biopsiaron dentro de un año antes de la resección endoscópica completa.

Concordancia entre muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia y muestras completamente resecadas. La mediana de tamaño de lesiones fue de 3 cm (rango 1-11). En 189 casos (39%) las biopsias no proporcionaron un grado de displasia correcto en comparación con la patología final después de la resección completa. 143 casos (29%) y 46 casos (9%) ascendieron y descendieron de categoría, respectivamente. El porcentaje de casos con resultados de biopsia discordantes fue del 40% en los casos con una sola biopsia tomada y del 38% en los casos en los que se tomaron múltiples biopsias. El tiempo desde la biopsia hasta la resección completa no influyó en el resultado erróneo de las biopsias. Notablemente, el porcentaje de resultados de biopsia discordantes fue de 37% y 35% en lesiones que midieron 1-2 cm y 2-4 cm, respectivamente.

Este estudio se diseñó para reflejar la rutina clínica, el número de biopsias obtenidas y la técnica de fórceps no fueron estandarizadas, lo que constituye una limitación. Este estudio demuestra que las biopsias con fórceps negativas a cáncer, de pólipos colorrectales grandes referidas para resección endoscópica, no son confiables. Teniendo en cuenta que la resección endoscópica de lesiones que contienen cáncer superficial es posible, el valor clínico de las biopsias con fórceps en lesiones aptas para la resección endoscópica es cuestionable.

Cross-sectional study among seropositive cases reported by the Northern Veracruz District IMSS Office in 2004. We analyzed the epidemiology, symptomology, clinical findings and disease progression. We calculated frequencies, proportions and averages. Clinical data and disease progression were compared. We studied 404 patients, divided into three groups: 75 with CD, 120 DHF and 212 cases with no hemorrhagic data although displaying Dengue with Thrombocytopenia (DwT). General symptoms were much less common among Dengue cases. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were more frequent among patients with DHF. Fluid leakage and hemorrhaging were observed in 75% and 46%, respectively, of the latter group. The history of prior infection was proportional. All patients presenting DHF showed thrombocytopenia, though only 3% showed hemoconcentration. The mean value for hematocrit was low (p=0.02) and the platelet count greater (p<0.001) among Dengue cases. Hemoglobin concentration showed no difference. The average time between disease onset and appearance of thrombocytopenia was similar in DHF cases (4.3+/- 1.6 days) and Dengue with Thrombocytopenia (4.3+/-1.6); even though, contrary to these, in the first group fluid leakage (3.7+/-1.8) and hemorrhaging (3.4+/-1.7) were previously identified. Our results confirm the presence of cases showing atypical disease course, without external hemorrhaging data but showing significant thrombocytopenia that may go unnoticed and worsen disease progression.",

  "abstract": "Current proposed KDIGO guidelines suggest systemic corticosteroid therapy to reduce glomerular inflammation in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), however the optimal timing for initiating steroid treatment remains a topic of debate. This study evaluates the impact of early versus delayed steroid initiation on long-term outcomes in IgAN patients. We conducted a retrospective study of 268 IgAN patients treated with corticosteroids for >3 months within 3 years of kidney biopsy. Patients were categorized into early therapy (steroids within 30 days) and delayed therapy (after 30 days). Propensity score matching created matched cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression assessed outcomes. The primary endpoint was a composite renal outcome [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >50% reduction, end-stage kidney disease or renal death]. Secondary endpoints included eGFR decline >30% or >40% and an eGFR slope and time-average proteinuria. Propensity score matching identified 191 individuals for analysis. The primary outcome was significantly better in the early therapy group, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.96,   = .041]. Significant benefits were also observed for secondary outcomes, including a lower frequency of >30% and >40% eGFR decline in the early therapy group, with HRs of 0.48 (95% CI 0.24-0.98,   = .04) and 0.34 (95% CI 0.14-0.81,   = .01), respectively. Cox regression confirmed that the timing of steroid initiation (early vs delayed) was a significant factor associated with kidney progression [HR = 0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.77),   = .01]. The average eGFR slope over 10 years was more favorable in the early therapy group (-1.0 ± 6.0 vs -2.9 ± 6.8 mL/min/1.73 m  per year,   = .039). No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found to influence the timing of steroid use in progressive IgAN. Early corticosteroid therapy may help reduce renal decline and preserve long-term kidney function in IgAN patients requiring steroid treatment.",

We report a multi-ancestry GWAS focusing on a narrow AUD phenotype, using novel statistical tools in a total sample of 1,041,450 individuals [102,079 cases; European, 75,583; African, 20,689 (mostly African-American); Hispanic American, 3,449; East Asian, 2,254; South Asian, 104; descent]. Cross-ancestry functional analyses were performed with European and African samples. Thirty-seven genome-wide significant loci (105 variants) were identified, of which seven were novel for AUD and six for other alcohol phenotypes. Loci were mapped to genes, which show altered expression in brain regions relevant for AUD (striatum, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex) and encode potential drug targets (GABAergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons). African-specific analysis yielded a unique pattern of immune-related gene sets. Polygenic overlap and positive genetic correlations showed extensive shared genetic architecture between AUD and both mental and general medical phenotypes, suggesting they are not only complications of alcohol use but also share genetic liability with AUD. Leveraging a cross-ancestry approach allowed identification of novel genetic loci for AUD and underscores the value of multi-ancestry genetic studies. These findings advance our understanding of AUD risk and clinically-relevant comorbidities.",

  "abstract": "The emergence of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) as a preferred treatment for various malignancies, because of its reduced cardiotoxicity compared with conventional doxorubicin, has raised significant interest. However, the association between PLD and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) remains a concerning and relatively rare complication. Here, we present the case of an 80-year-old man with metastatic Kaposi sarcoma who underwent extended PLD monotherapy, subsequently developing kidney-limited TMA demonstrated on kidney biopsy. This led to acute kidney injury necessitating hemodialysis. The patient's clinical history, laboratory, and kidney biopsy data supported PLD chemotherapy as the primary etiologic factor for the observed kidney-limited TMA, an insidious condition with poor prognosis. This report highlights the need for vigilance and early kidney biopsy in patients with rising serum creatinine concentrations or worsening proteinuria/hematuria during PLD therapy. Understanding the mechanisms underlying PLD-induced TMA, likely involving reactive oxygen species-mediated endothelial dysfunction and platelet aggregation, remains a crucial area for future research to optimize monitoring and management strategies for this rare yet severe complication associated with PLD therapy.",

  "abstract": "Acute kidney injury is a crucial prognostic factor for multiple myeloma. The most common cause is light chain cast nephropathy. The primary pathology of light chain-induced acute kidney injury involves obstruction of distal tubules due to the interaction of free light chains (FLCs) with Tamm-Horsfall protein produced there. Based on this pathology, chemotherapy is used to suppress the production of FLCs. Recently, combined blood purification therapies to remove existing FLCs have been used. However, the extent to which FLCs are removed by blood purification therapy remains unclear. We investigated the dialysis removal rates under various conditions and found that hemodialysis achieved 16% removal, plasma exchange 75%, and online hemodiafiltration varied from 20% to 31%. Although online hemodiafiltration is less effective than plasma exchange, it is a viable option that does not require albumin infusions or lead to infections. Despite hematologic remission, renal recovery was limited by a high number of casts, severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and the delay in treatment initiation.",

A total of 3,289 patients with AKI admitted to a tertiary care hospital from November 2015-October 2016, with follow-up until September 2020. ACEi/ARB use within 180 days post-AKI. All-cause mortality, and major adverse kidney events (MAKE) as defined by composite of renal replacement therapy post-AKI, sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline >30% from baseline, or eGFR ≤15 mL/min/1.73 m . We generated propensity weights for ACEi/ARB use post-AKI, using age, sex, comorbid conditions, prior medication, intensive care unit admission, severe sepsis, and index AKI Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes severity. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test associations of post-AKI ACEi/ARB with mortality, MAKE, and joint models for eGFR slopes. A total of 2,309 (70.2%) participants died or experienced MAKE by end of follow-up. 161 (4.9%) and 406 (12.3%) patients initiated or resumed prior ACEi/ARB use within 180 days post-AKI, respectively. Although the overall cohort had no significant mortality association with post-AKI ACEi/ARB use, a significant association with lower mortality was observed in patients with KDIGO 3 AKI (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.75;     = 0.003). However, post-AKI ACEi/ARB use was associated with increased MAKE in patients without cardiovascular indications for ACEi/ARB use (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-1.98;     = 0.03). Although post-AKI use of ACEi/ARB was associated with acute eGFR decline (initial eGFR change -2.3 mL/min/1.73 m /year; 95% CI, -3.1 to -1.5;   < 0.001), no association with longer-term eGFR decline was observed. Retrospective observational study on heterogeneous AKI cohort without data on ACEi/ARB cumulative exposure. Early ACEi/ARB post-AKI was not associated with better long-term survival or kidney function but was associated with lower mortality in patients with KDIGO 3 AKI. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized adults and increases the risk of death and kidney failure. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been widely used in proteinuric kidney disease to slow kidney function decline, the effect of ACEi/ARB use post-AKI on long-term kidney function remains unclear. In this 5-year study of 3,289 patients with AKI, we found that although patients experienced a transient decrease in kidney function following early ACEi/ARB initiation after their kidney injury, long-term kidney function trajectory and survival in these patients were similar to patients without early ACEi/ARB use. However, ACEi/ARB use after an AKI may reduce the long-term risk of death in patients with severe AKI. Additionally, we noted sustained kidney function deterioration in a subgroup of patients on ACEi/ARB early post-AKI in the absence of cardiovascular indications. These observations suggest that clinicians should adopt more individualized approaches to early ACEi/ARB administration post-AKI.",

  "abstract": "Several observational studies have revealed that different neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are associated with delirium, yet the direction and magnitude of the causal association remain poorly understood. Herein, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between these factors and delirium. GWAS data for delirium were sourced from the FINN10 database; GWAS data for risk factors (protein kinase C-binding protein NELL1, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, nerve growth factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor levels) were from the IEU Open GWAS. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as a primary analysis. MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and weighted model were applied to validate the robustness of the results. The MR-Egger regression method was used to explore the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, and the MR pleiotropy residual sum, and outlier (MR-PRESSO) method was applied to detect potential outliers. Cochran's Q test assessed heterogeneity among instrumental variables (IVs). The leave-one-out (LOO) method was used to enhance the precision and veracity of our findings. IVW analyses revealed no association between risk factors and delirium. MR Egger, WM, and the weighted mode approach further confirmed these data. MR-Egger regression analysis confirmed the absence of directional pleiotropy in our analysis. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses showed reliable results. No association between other factors and delirium was identified; however, further research is needed to determine if these results apply to other races. Also, advances in molecular biology and epigenetics may shed light on this topic.",

  "abstract": "Endothelial cells regulate vascular tone, blood flow, coagulation, and inflammation, with heterogeneous populations serving specific roles throughout the body. In the kidney, endothelial cells maintain vascular integrity and function, contribute to filtration, and support other renal structures. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key signaling molecule that maintains vascular tone and endothelial function. It is synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, with endothelial NOS playing a central role in vascular health. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by reduced NO bioavailability, driven by the accumulation of endogenous NOS inhibitors such as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). Uremic toxins, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to a prothrombotic and proinflammatory state, contributing to endothelial dysfunction and exacerbating cardiovascular (CV) risks in CKD. Biomarkers such as ADMA, SDMA, endothelial microparticles, and soluble adhesion molecules offer insights into vascular health, while invasive or noninvasive diagnostic techniques can assess endothelial function in CKD. Effective management strategies focus on enhancing NO bioavailability, controlling oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, and optimizing dialysis to minimize uremic toxin levels. Emerging therapeutic approaches, including antioxidant therapies and endothelial progenitor cell-based interventions, show promise in preserving vascular function. A multifaceted approach to managing endothelial dysfunction is critical for mitigating CV complications and improving patient outcomes in CKD.",

  "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a complex syncytial arrangement of an array of cell types and, in the case of muscle-specific cells (myofibres), subtypes. There exists extensive heterogeneity in skeletal muscle functional behaviour and molecular landscape at the cell composition, myofibre subtype and intra-myofibre subtype level. This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts. Here we developed a novel approach that combines a fluorescence-based assay for the biophysical examination of the sarcomeric protein, myosin, coupled with same-myofibre high-sensitivity proteome profiling, termed single myofibre protein function-omics (SMPFO). Applying this approach as proof-of-principle we identify the integrated relationship between myofibre functionality and the underlying proteomic landscape that guides divergent, but physiologically important, behaviour in myofibre subtypes in healthy human skeletal muscle. By applying SMPFO to two forms of human nemaline myopathy (ACTA1 and TNNT1 mutations), we reveal significant reduction in the divergence of myofibre subtypes across both biophysical and proteomic behaviour. Collectively we demonstrate preliminary findings of SMPFO to support its use to study skeletal muscle with greater specificity, accuracy and resolution than currently applied methods, facilitating that advancement in understanding of skeletal muscle tissue in both healthy and diseased states. KEY POINTS: Skeletal muscle is a complex tissue made up of an array of cell and sub-cell types, with the resident muscle cell - myofibre - critical for contractile function. Although single myofibre studies have advanced, existing methods lack the precision for simultaneous multidata analysis, hindering developments in our understanding of skeletal muscle. We introduce single myofibre protein function-omics (SMPFO), a method enabling functional analysis of sarcomeric myosin alongside global protein abundance within the same myofibre. In healthy myofibres SMyoMFO reveals extensive biochemical diversity in myosin heads, correlating with the abundance of metabolic and sarcomeric proteins, including subtype-specific patterns in sarcoglycan delta (SGCD). In contrast SMyoMFO uniquely reveals a reduction in diversity of myosin function and the myofibre proteome in two forms of nemaline myopathy, highlighting disease-associated alterations. This innovative approach provides a robust framework for investigating myofibre regulation and dysfunction in skeletal muscle biology.",

  "abstract": "Digital ulcers (DUs) are a major cause of pain and disability in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and remain a major treatment challenge. Our aim was to explore clinicians' perspectives towards treatment initiation and escalation, akin to a 'Treat to Target' (T2T) strategy. SSc clinicians were invited to participate in an online survey. A total of 173 responses (75% rheumatologists) were obtained from 33 countries. When initiating a change in oral drug therapy for SSc-DUs, most (80%) respondents would consider adding new medication to existing treatment, and 50% would increase existing treatment dose. Time to assess the impact of treatment change varied considerably, with around half (43.6%) waiting 1 month. Endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors and prostanoids were considered most efficacious for DU prevention, with good perceived efficacy from calcium channel blockers and moderate benefit from anti-platelet agents and immunosuppression. Side effects (e.g. headache and peripheral oedema) are perceived to be a significant issue with oral vasodilatory/vasoactive therapies in many patients. The highest rated T2T targets were (1) complete absence of new/recurrent DUs (63%), (2) reduction >50% in the number of DU recurrence (52%) and (3) reduction in DU healing time (37%) and reduction in DU pain >50% (37%). The most frequent reasons for hospitalisation were to administer intravenous treatment (91%) and DU complications (87%). Surgery is reserved for the threatened digit (e.g. gangrene), underlying calcinosis and failure of medical therapy. Significant heterogeneity currently exists concerning treatment initiation and escalation for SSc-DUs, potentially amenable to a T2T strategy.",

  "abstract": "This Consensus Workshop dealt with diagnostic methodologies in the context of surveillance, screening, assessment of stage and grade, prognosis, monitoring and prediction of periodontal status. Several elements provided the impetus for the workshop, including the limited quality of available research on diagnostic tests, the rapid development of new technologies, the implementation of the 2018 classification and the declarations of the World Health Organisation on diagnosis and oral health. To update and evaluate the evidence on diagnostic methods, considering recent advances in knowledge and the implementation of the 2018 classification. The European Workshop Committee of the European Federation of Periodontology guided the development of a consensus report after commissioning eight systematic reviews within three working groups. The reviews were discussed during the in-person consensus meeting involving 70 participants from 21 different countries. Working Group 1 discussed innovations in traditional diagnostic approaches, justified manual probing as the reference standard and assessed the value of image-based methods. Working Group 2 analysed diagnostic tests based on microbial and host biomarkers and genetic diagnostic tests. Working Group 3 covered emerging technologies to be used within dental and non-dental clinical settings, focusing principally on the impact of questionnaire-based assessments and artificial intelligence systems (AIS) in interpreting different data modalities. Although manual periodontal probing is firmly established as the reference standard, additional approaches based on imaging, biomarkers, host genetics, questionnaires and the development of emerging applied data science methods (e.g., AIS) are increasingly integrated in periodontal diagnostics.",

  "abstract": "The relationship between biopsy-proven liver fibrosis progression and renal function decline in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has not been fully elucidated. We used an automated quantitative liver fibrosis assessment (qFibrosis) technique to investigate the temporal changes in regional liver fibrosis. This retrospective longitudinal study included 68 MASLD patients and their paired formalin-fixed sections of liver biopsies. One hundred eighty-four fibrosis parameters were quantified in five different hepatic regions, including portal tract, peri-portal, zone 2, peri-central and central vein regions, and qFibrosis continuous values were calculated for all samples based on 10 fibrosis parameters using qFibrosis assessment. Liver fibrosis progression (QLF , n = 18) and regression (QLF , n = 23) was defined as at least a 20% relative change in qFibrosis over a 23-month follow-up. Renal function decline was assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) changes. The eGFR decline was greater in the QLF  group (106.53 ± 13.71 ml/min/1.73 m    105.28 ± 12.46 ml/min/1.73 m ) than in the QLF  group (110.87 ± 14.58 ml/min/1.73 m    114.18 ± 14.81 ml/min/1.73 m ). In addition, liver fibrosis changes in the central vein and pericentral regions were more strongly associated with eGFR decline than in periportal, zone 2 and portal tract regions. We combined these parameters to construct a prediction model, which better differentiated eGFR decline (a cut-off value of qFibrosis combined index = 0.52,   <0.001). A decline in renal function is significantly related to liver fibrosis progression in MASLD. Regional qFibrosis assessment may efficiently predict eGFR decline, thus highlighting the importance of assessing renal function in patients with MASLD with worsening liver fibrosis. The study shows that liver fibrosis progression assessed by qFibrosis may be associated with renal function decline, which provides a new perspective for understanding complex pathological processes. A combination of artificial intelligence and digital pathology may earlier and more precisely quantify the progression of regional liver fibrosis, thus better identifying changes in renal function. This opens the possibility of early interventions, which are essential to improve patients' outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Efficient wound healing remains a formidable medical challenge in clinical practice, due to the prevalence of skin defects arising from diverse etiological factors. It is indisputable that epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a pivotal role in wound repair. However, its clinical application through recombinant proteins encounters challenges, including a short half-life in vivo and high production costs. Addressing these limitations, recent advancements in chemically modified mRNA (cmRNA) technologies offer a promising alternative. This study explores the utilisation of cmRNA in a biocompatible citrate-saline formulation to encode EGF for therapeutic purposes, capitalising on the advantages of cmRNA's inherent stability and the formulation's compatibility with biological systems. CmRNA demonstrated high transfection efficiency in human immortalised keratinocyte (HaCaT) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cells (93.97% ± 1.25% and 90.37% ± 0.97%, respectively), resulting in efficient production of biologically active EGF protein. In vitro, EGF cmRNA significantly promoted HaCaT and NHDF cell cycle, proliferation and migration. In vivo, in vivo imaging system (IVIS) imaging of murine skin confirmed localised and sustained expression of Luciferase cmRNA, with signals detectable up to 11 days post-injection. Immunohistochemistry revealed protein expression in both epidermal and dermal layers as early as 1 h post-injection, peaking at 48 h, further corroborated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a full-thickness skin defect mouse model, EGF cmRNA significantly accelerated wound healing, with superior re-epithelialisation observed compared to controls by Day 6. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Ki67 mRNA expression levels were markedly increased, both in vitro and in vivo. By Day 14, histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that EGF cmRNA outperformed recombinant human EGF (rhEGF), as indicated by enhanced formation of hair follicles and cutaneous glands, better-organised collagen fibres, and a reduced collagen Type I/III ratio. No adverse effects were observed in major organs, confirming cmRNA's biosafety. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of EGF-encoding cmRNA as an effective and safe alternative for enhancing wound healing.",

  "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) often co-occur, yet their relationship remains elusive. While some studies suggest that T2D lowers PCa risk, others report conflicting data. This study investigates the effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists Bezafibrate, Tesaglitazar, and Pioglitazone on PCa tumorigenesis. Analysis of patient datasets revealed that high PPARG expression correlates with advanced PCa and poor survival. The PPARγ agonists Pioglitazone and Tesaglitazar notably reduced cell proliferation and PPARγ protein levels in primary and metastatic PCa-derived cells. Proteomic analysis identified intrinsic differences in mTORC1 and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathways between primary and metastatic PCa cells, which were further disrupted by Tesaglitazar and Pioglitazone. Moreover, metabolomics, Seahorse Assay-based metabolic profiling, and radiotracer uptake assays revealed that Pioglitazone shifted primary PCa cells' metabolism towards glycolysis and increased FAO in metastatic cells, reducing mitochondrial ATP production. Furthermore, Pioglitazone suppressed cell migration in primary and metastatic PCa cells and induced the epithelial marker E-Cadherin in primary PCa cells. In vivo, Pioglitazone reduced tumor growth in a metastatic PC3 xenograft model, increased phosho AMPKα and decreased phospho mTOR levels. In addition, diabetic PCa patients treated with PPAR agonists post-radical prostatectomy implied no biochemical recurrence over five to ten years compared to non-diabetic PCa patients. Our findings suggest that Pioglitazone reduces PCa cell proliferation and induces metabolic and epithelial changes, highlighting the potential of repurposing metabolic drugs for PCa therapy.",

  "abstract": "The relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and bleeding risk during antiplatelet therapy post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is uncertain, and the effect of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) on bleeding risk is unknown. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 85,464 PCI patients on oral antiplatelet therapy across 82 Tianjin hospitals from 2017 to 2023, using 1:1 PSM. The primary outcome was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 3 or 5 bleeding within one year. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were employed to assess the association between PCSK9i and clinical outcomes, with Win ratio analysis used for composite endpoints. Among 85,464 patients (64 % male), 1979 (2.32 %) received PCSK9i were followed for one year. After PSM, a balanced cohort of 1951 patients in both the PCSK9i and control groups was established. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that patients on PCSK9i had significantly reduced risks of NACE (aHR: 0.674, 95 %CI: 0.528-0.859, P = 0.001), MACCE (aHR: 0.674, 95 %CI: 0.524-0.866, P = 0.002), all-cause death (aHR: 0.501, 95 %CI: 0.275-0.915, p = 0.025), and revascularization (aHR: 0.604, 95 %CI: 0.419-0.872, P = 0.007) at one year. No significant differences were found in other endpoints. The hierarchical outcome significantly favored PCSK9i (matched win ratio 0.634, 95 % CI: 0.584-0.689, P < 0.001). PCSK9i therapy did not increase bleeding risk and was associated with lower risks of adverse outcomes compared to the control group.",

  "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) remains a significant global health burden, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where access to effective screening and treatment is limited. Despite advancements in conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, challenges related to late-stage diagnosis, treatment resistance, and disease recurrence persist. The emergence of microRNAs (miRNAs) as key regulators of gene expression has revolutionized cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Exosomal miRNAs, in particular, have garnered attention due to their stability, detectability in bodily fluids, and pivotal roles in tumor progression, metastasis, and immune modulation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the role of exosomal miRNAs in the theranostic landscape of CC. We explore their involvement in disease pathogenesis, highlighting their potential as minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring. Furthermore, we examine their utility in therapeutic strategies, including miRNA-mediated drug delivery systems and miRNA-targeted interventions to overcome chemoresistance. Integrating exosomal miRNA profiling with current diagnostic modalities could enhance screening sensitivity and specificity, while miRNA-based therapies offer novel avenues to improve treatment efficacy. This review discusses recent advancements in miRNA research, current challenges in clinical translation, and future perspectives on leveraging exosomal miRNAs for personalized CC care.",

Studies have indicated that CNS diseases and conditions associated with meningeal lymphatic drainage dysfunction include neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, infections, traumatic brain injury, tumors, functional cranial disorders, and hydrocephalus. However, the understanding of the regulatory and damage mechanisms of meningeal lymphatics under physiological and pathological conditions is currently limited. Given the importance of a profound understanding of the interplay between meningeal lymphatic drainage and CNS diseases, this review covers seven key aspects: the development and structure of meningeal lymphatic vessels, methods for observing meningeal lymphatics, the function of meningeal lymphatics, the molecular mechanisms of meningeal lymphatic injury, the relationships between meningeal lymphatic vessels and CNS diseases, potential regulatory mechanisms of meningeal lymphatics, and conclusions and outstanding questions. We will explore the relationship between the development, structure, and function of meningeal lymphatics, review current methods for observing meningeal lymphatic vessels in both animal models and humans, and identify unresolved key points in meningeal lymphatic research. The aim of this review is to provide new directions for future research and therapeutic strategies targeting meningeal lymphatics by critically analyzing recent advancements in the field, identifying gaps in current knowledge, and proposing innovative approaches to address these gaps.",
