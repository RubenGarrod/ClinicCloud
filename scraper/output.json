  "abstract": "Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are rare, chronic conditions characterized by blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder in which autoantibodies target coagulation factor VIII, often associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of AIBD and AHA is rare, with limited understanding of their combined impacts. We aimed to synthesize the available evidence and provide insights into clinical manifestations, treatment strategies, and survival outcomes of such patients. We searched for relevant literature in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus, and combined patient information from our hospital to provide a comprehensive analysis. A total of 80 patients were included. Through log-rank tests, older age (p = 0.03) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) (p = 0.047) were associated with shorter survival time. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, mortality was only associated with older age (HR: 1.13, p = 0.02). Patients presenting both AIBD and AHA exhibit intricate clinical presentations and are at risk of severe, potentially fatal outcomes. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding bleeding in AIBD patients, particularly those with BP and those in the geriatric population.",

  "abstract": "Delayed healing of corneal epithelial injury can cause irreversible scarring and severely affect vision. Outstanding progress has been made in recent years regarding corneal epithelial repair. However, studies investigating the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in this process remain limited. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of m6A modification and its regulators in the healing of the corneal epithelium. In this study, we used the C57BL/6 mouse corneal alkali burn model as an in vivo model and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) as an in vitro subject. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of YTHDF2, METTL3, and FTO in HCECs. We evaluated the effects of downregulating m6A modification regulators on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCECs under basal conditions and following IL-1β stimulation. The results suggest that m6A and its regulators are involved in the healing process of the corneal epithelium. Following corneal alkali burns, m6A levels were elevated, while the expression of METTL3, FTO, and YTHDF2 was reduced. In HCECs stimulated with IL-1β, m6A levels were significantly increased, and the expression of FTO and YTHDF2 was decreased. Silencing METTL3 and YTHDF2 enhanced the proliferation and migration of HCECs by increasing HSP70 expression, thereby facilitating corneal epithelial healing. In contrast, silencing FTO may impede corneal epithelial healing by promoting apoptosis in HCECs and inhibiting their proliferation and migration. This study offers a novel perspective on the treatment of delayed corneal epithelial healing.",

  "abstract": "Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are crucial for maintaining cutaneous functions under various pathological conditions, including wounds. Tumour necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) interacts with its receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), and plays a role in the development and tissue repair of skin diseases. This study aims to elucidate the effects of TWEAK/Fn14 signalling on HFSCs and the associated mechanisms. The expressions of HFSC markers, including K19, integrin β1 and K15, were analysed via immunohistochemistry in normal and Fn14-deficient mouse skin. Primary HFSCs were cultured in vitro and then treated with TWEAK or a chemokine (CXC motif) (CXCR) 4 inhibitor. The phenotype markers and secreted cytokines of HFSCs were assessed via immunofluorescence analysis, Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that both Fn14 and CXCR4 were highly expressed in hair follicles. Fn14 deficiency led to a decrease in the expression levels of K19 and CD34. Exogenous TWEAK enhanced the expression of K15, K19, integrin β1, tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 and CXCR4 in cultured HFSCs. Additionally, TWEAK induced the proliferation, migration and cytokine production in HFSCs. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway was upregulated in HFSCs upon TWEAK stimulation, and inhibitors of β-catenin or CXCR4 suppressed the effects of TWEAK on the differentiation and secretory functions of HFSCs. In conclusion, TWEAK/Fn14 interaction regulates the expression of differentiation markers and secretory functions of HFSCs in vitro. Wnt/β-catenin signalling or CXCR4 activation mediates the effects of TWEAK on HFSCs. Targeting the Fn14-Wnt/β-catenin-CXCR4 signalling axis may offer a potential approach for managing HFSC-related skin diseases, such as wounds.",

  "abstract": "Chronic urticaria (CU) treatment with omalizumab is considered safe in short-term studies. Large real-world studies focusing on the long-term safety of omalizumab and associated factors are lacking. We aimed to investigate the spectrum of reported side effects in omalizumab-treated CU patients in a large long-term daily practice cohort. A multinational multicentre retrospective study was conducted at 14 specialised urticaria centres (UCAREs), including all CU patients ever treated with omalizumab until centre-specific data lock. The prevalence of patient-reported side effects was assessed. A total of 1859 patients were included, of which 32.9% (n = 612) reported side effects during omalizumab treatment with a wide range across centres (0%-75.5%). Fatigue (15.8%, n = 293), headache (11.6%, n = 215) and flu-like symptoms (9.3%, n = 172) were most common. No events suggestive of anaphylaxis and no new notably prevalent side effects were reported. Hair loss was reported by 2.9% (n = 53/1859) of patients, leading to treatment adjustment in 21.1% (n = 8/38 with sufficient data). Patients who reported side effects were more often female (78.3% vs. 68.6%, p < 0.001), had worse disease control prior to omalizumab (Urticaria Control Test, UCT, 4.0 vs. 6.0, p < 0.001), and lower fast response (Weekly Urticaria Activity Score, UAS7, < 7 or UCT > 11 within 4 weeks, 42.6% vs. 59.5%, p < 0.001) and complete/good response rates (UAS7 < 7 or UCT > 11 at end of treatment, 72.3% vs. 84.4%, p < 0.001) compared to patients without side effects. While only 2.4% (n = 44/1859) of patients discontinued treatment due to side effects, 5.5% (n = 100/1859) and 12.8% (n = 238/1859) of patients reporting side effects with insufficient (UAS7 ≥ 7 or UCT 3-11 at end of treatment) and complete/good response, respectively, remained on omalizumab. The safety and tolerability of omalizumab was confirmed. Notably, the wide variation in reported side effects across centres suggests that differences in awareness influence reporting. Hair loss was more prevalent than described before, warranting extra attention. Side effects were more often reported in patients whose characteristics suggest reduced effectiveness of omalizumab, possibly related to a negative association with omalizumab and suggesting increased disease burden. Availability of new therapies might increase the impact of side effects on treatment decisions, not only in omalizumab-refractory patients but potentially even among good responders.",

The purpose of this study is to determine whether moxibustion acupuncture is effective in accelerating Bell's palsy patients' recovery and compare the recovery rates of patients with and without diabetes mellitus. 102 patients with Bell's palsy participated in the current study. Their ages ranged from 12 to 73. They were randomly classified into an experimental group (A) of 52 patients who received moxibustion acupuncture and a control group (B) of 50 patients who received medications only. The HOUSE BRACKMANN GRADING system was used before the session, after 3 weeks, and after 6 weeks. Within-group comparison, there was a statistically significant reduction in the House Brackmann (HB) scores of group A and group B at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment compared with that pre-treatment (p < 0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in HB of groups A and B at 6 weeks compared with 3 weeks post-treatment (p < 0.001). on the other hand, the between-groups comparison showed a statistically significant reduction in HB of group A compared with that of group B at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-treatment intervention (p < 0.001).

  "abstract": "Cupping therapy is widely recognized for its effects on various health conditions. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying its benefits remain speculative and unproven. To propose a hypothesis that explains the physiological mechanisms of dry cupping therapy based on clinical evidence, addressing gaps in existing hypotheses. A case study was conducted involving five patients subjected to dry cupping on different body parts for varying durations. The serum extracted from incidental blisters formed during the procedure was analyzed biochemically and microscopically. Biochemical analysis revealed that the creatinine levels in the blister serum were double those in sweat, indicating muscular involvement even when venous level was normal. These findings suggest that dry cupping primarily affects the skin through processes such as transduction, conduction, and transmission, with secondary effects on muscles. The muscular response to dry cupping induces the release of myokines, which initiate an inflammatory response that contributes to the systemic effects of the therapy. This hypothesis offers a plausible explanation for the physiological mechanisms of dry cupping therapy, emphasizing the interplay between skin and muscle responses and their systemic implications. Further research is needed to validate this hypothesis and explore its clinical relevance.",

  "abstract": "Factors associated with vitiligo burden in patients with darker skin (Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI) are not fully understood. This analysis of patients in the global VALIANT study examined the quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial health among patients with vitiligo by skin type. Participants from 17 countries were surveyed regarding their clinical characteristics, everyday experiences with vitiligo, impact of vitiligo on daily activities, emotional well-being, and mental health. Of 3541 surveyed patients, 40.8% (n = 1445) had darker skin versus 59.2% (n = 2096) with fairer skin (types I-III). Patients with darker skin had greater median disease extent than those with fairer skin (6.6% vs 2.5%; P < 0.0001). Mean Vitiligo Impact Patient scale scores were higher among patients with darker skin (31.2 vs 24.5; P < 0.0001); daily activities and emotional well-being were significantly more impacted among patients with darker skin. Among individual skin types, patients with types V and VI expressed considerably higher rates of burden versus all other skin types in all assessments. Interestingly, among patients with fairer skin, those with skin type I reported higher rates of burden than those with skin types II and III. Patients with darker skin, particularly skin types V and VI, were more impacted in their daily lives, emotional well-being, and mental health than those with fairer skin, suggesting that a disproportionate need for strategies to improve QoL and mental health burden exists among patients with vitiligo who have skin of color. Vitiligo is a disease that causes white patches to appear on the skin. The study described here analyzed whether vitiligo is more difficult for people with darker skin. To answer this question, the authors used data from a large patient survey called the VALIANT study. Over 3000 people living with vitiligo from 17 countries responded to the survey, and close to half had darker skin. People with darker skin tended to report that larger areas of their body were covered in white patches, suggesting that people with fairer skin may underestimate the extent of their vitiligo. In addition, people with darker skin reported a worse effect on their daily life than those with fairer skin; were more likely to be discouraged and worried about their disease spreading; and were more likely to feel that their vitiligo affected what clothes they wore or what activities they participated in. People with darker skin reported more difficulty with their careers and were more likely to be anxious or depressed. Even among people with darker skin (three types), effects of vitiligo were worst among those with the darkest skin. These results show that vitiligo is a difficult disease for all people living with vitiligo, but the burden is most amplified among people with darker skin.",

  "abstract": "Cosmetic blepharoplasty is the most common plastic surgery procedures in East Asian and also one of the procedures most prone to unsatisfactory outcomes. The crease width is a crucial aesthetic criterion for individuals seeking aesthetic enhancements, and due to the various influencing factors, the outcomes of blepharoplasty tend to be unpredictable. We assessed the apparent height of the double eyelid, incision width, levator muscle function, palpebral fissure height, skin-orbicularis oculi muscle thickness, upper eyelid tissue thickness, and age of Asian women aged 18-35 seeking aesthetic enhancements one-year post-blepharoplasty. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the apparent height of the double eyelid and other variables. The study revealed a correlation between the apparent width of the double eyelid and the incision width, levator muscle function, skin-orbicularis oculi muscle thickness, eyelid tissue thickness, and age (standardized regression coefficients were 0.423, - 0.566, 0.156, - 0.332, and 0.235, respectively), but not with palpebral fissure height. The multiple regression model had an adjusted R square of 0.695. The apparent crease width following blepharoplasty is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, it is essential for the operating physician to comprehensively evaluate the levator muscle function, upper eyelid puffiness, and age of the individual seeking aesthetic enhancement before the surgery. Personalizing the design of the surgical incision height during the procedure is crucial to achieve the desired double eyelid width and morphology.

We systematically reviewed the available literature regarding nonsurgical temporal volumization with injectable fillers. On Sept 16, 2024, Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane databases were queried with relevant terms for all articles describing temporal volumization with injectable fillers, including those with temple-specific data within the context of full-face volumization. Studies unrelated to temporal volumization, using autologous fat or its derivatives, limited to temporal lifting via injection into the temporoparietal scalp, without novel clinical/patient data, or unavailable in English were excluded. Database query yielded 680 unique articles. One additional article was found with citation searching. After screening and evaluation for duplicates and inclusion/exclusion criteria, 40 articles were included. Nineteen studies were prospective and 21 studies were retrospective, of which 9 were complication case reports. A total of 881 patients were treated with either hyaluronic acid (n = 783), calcium hydroxylapatite (n = 93), polymethylmethacrylate (n = 28), allograft adipose matrix (n = 10), and poly-L-lactic acid (n = 2).

  "abstract": "Our objective was to investigate the accuracy of prenatal diagnoses of congenital lung malformations (CLM) compared to postnatal diagnoses in a population in northern Finland and to estimate the birth prevalence of CLMs in the same population. A retrospective review of all CLM cases in a tertiary referral center, Oulu University Hospital, Finland, in 2010-2020. Data were collected from medical records. The final postnatal diagnosis was recorded as the pathologic-anatomic diagnosis, if available, and otherwise as the postnatal radiologic diagnosis. Our case series comprises 37 CLM cases. The prenatal detection rate of CLMs was 100%. The prenatal diagnosis was congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) in 34/37 cases (92%). The accuracy of prenatal CLM diagnoses was 60% compared to postnatal radiologic diagnoses and 51% compared to final postnatal diagnoses. Relative frequencies of different diagnoses in postnatally confirmed CLM cases were CPAM 47% (16/34 cases), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) 15% (5/34), hybrid CPAM/BPS 15% (5/34), congenital lobar overinflation (CLO) 15% (5/34), bronchial atresia 6% (2/34), and bronchogenic cyst 3% (1/34). Postnatally confirmed cases of CPAM were more likely to have a higher CPAM-volume ratio at diagnosis (p = 0.002), a higher maximum CPAM-volume ratio during pregnancy (p < 0.001), macrocystic appearance on ultrasonography (p = 0.026), and mediastinal shift (p < 0.001) compared with the rest of the cases in this study. The prevalence of all CLMs combined was 3.71 cases per 10 000 live births. The prevalences of CPAM, BPS, hybrid CPAM/BPS, and CLO were 1.69, 0.56, 0.56, and 0.56 cases per 10 000 live births, respectively. We found that all CLMs were detected prenatally, but almost half of the prenatal diagnoses were inaccurate compared to postnatal diagnoses. Most lesions were diagnosed prenatally as CPAM, but postnatally many of them turned out to be BPS, hybrid CPAM/BPS, or CLO. Postnatally confirmed CPAM cases were more likely to have a high CPAM-volume ratio, mediastinal shift, and macrocystic appearance on prenatal ultrasonography compared with other CLMs. The prevalence of CLMs is still relatively poorly documented, but we provide new estimates in Finland.",

A total of 38 women, aged 18-45 years, were recruited from a private rehabilitation center specializing in sports health, and divided into two groups: runners (n = 19) and sedentary women (n = 19). Thickness measurements, using suprapubic ultrasongraphy in B-Mode, of the EO, IO, TrA and RA muscles were taken at rest and during active contraction. Location of the bladder neck at rest and during pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction was taken with the transducer located suprapubically in M-Mode. There were no significant differences in EO TrA or RA muscle thickness at rest and during muscle contraction between runners and controls. For the IO muscle, significant differences were observed during ASLR, with runners showing greater muscle thickness (p = 0.032). Bladder neck displacement during a voluntary PFM contraction demonstrated statistically larger cranial movement for the runners of mean 0.76 ± 0.31 cm than mean 0.40 ± 0.26 cm for the sedentary group (p = 0.001). regular running is associated with increased thickness of the IO during ASLR, and significantly greater cranial bladder neck displacement during PFM contraction.",

A 31-year-old G4P2012 was referred for fetal ventriculomegaly identified during routine first-trimester ultrasound. Comprehensive fetal evaluation included serial imaging, fetal echocardiography, and whole genome sequencing. Genetic counseling and multidisciplinary care were provided throughout the pregnancy. Imaging confirmed progressive, severe ventriculomegaly without evidence of neural tube defect or cardiac abnormality. Whole genome sequencing revealed a novel de novo heterozygous c.689C>A, p.(Ala230Asp) variant in TGFBR1, classified as likely pathogenic. The patient underwent cesarean delivery at 37w1d due to significant macrocephaly. Postnatal findings included Dandy-Walker malformation requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt, unilateral retinal detachment, and focal seizures. Postnatal echocardiogram was normal. Dysmorphic features and clinical findings were consistent with LDS1. This case expands the prenatal phenotype associated with Loeys-Dietz Syndrome type 1, demonstrating that severe ventriculomegaly and macrocephaly may be early markers of disease. Early identification of LDS1 through advanced prenatal imaging and genetic testing may support anticipatory guidance and multidisciplinary care planning.",

  "abstract": "Predicting preeclampsia (PE) within the first 16 weeks of gestation is difficult due to various risk factors, poorly understood causes and likely multiple pathogenic phenotypes of preeclampsia.  OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to develop prediction models for early-onset preeclampsia (EPE) and late-onset preeclampsia (LPE) respectively using clinical data, metabolome and proteome analyses on plasma samples and laboratory data. We retrospectively recruited 56 EPE, 50 LPE patients and 92 normotensive controls from three tertiary hospitals and used clinical and laboratory data in early pregnancy. Models for EPE and LPE were fitted with the use of patient' clinical, multi-omics and laboratory data. By comparing multi-omics and laboratory test variables between EPE, LPE and healthy controls, we identified sets of differentially expressed biomarkers, including 49 and 33 metabolites, 28 and 36 proteins as well as 5 and 7 laboratory variables associated with EPE and LPE respectively. Using the random forest algorithm, we developed a prediction model using seven clinical factors, seven metabolites, five laboratory test variables. The model yielded the highest accuracy for EPE prediction with good sensitivity (87.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.64%-97.34%) and specificity (94.1%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%). We also developed a prediction model that exhibited high accuracy in separating LPE from controls (sensitivity: 66.67%, 95% CI: 43.03%-85.41%; specificity: 94.12%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%) using seven clinical factors, five metabolites and eight proteins. Our study has identified a set of significant omics and laboratory features for PE prediction. The established models yielded high prediction performance for preeclampsia risk from clinical, multi-omics and laboratory information.",

Program faculty and staff curate and contribute relevant clinical and research news, resources, and events, including research opportunities, support groups, webinars, and in-person events. We exploratorily analyzed recipient data using Emma to describe patient engagement with monthly and standalone e-communications from September 2020 to April 2023, including open rates (number opened/number successful deliveries) and click-to-open rates (number clicks/number opened). An average of 3915 young patients were emailed monthly e-communications (range 3202-4380). The open rate steadily increased from 19.3 to 53.0% over 31 months. The topics with the highest click rate were content related to virtual or in-person peer- and social work-led support meetings (15%), healthy lifestyle and integrative therapy (15%), DFCI-organized conferences/series (13%), and managing the details of life (10%). One topic of interest was that of fertility and childrearing, comprising almost 50% of all clicks between March 2021 and June 2021, and almost 20% between December 2022 and March 2023. Young patients with breast cancer engage heavily with programmatic e-communications focused on information about opportunities to interact with peers or experts, whether support meetings or informational events. This group appears eager for additional information on the unique lifestyle and reproductive challenges that they may face.",

  "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant public health challenge worldwide. This study examines the impact of screening history on the prognosis of cervical carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer among Taiwanese women. Data from the National Cervical Cancer Screening Registry and Taiwan Cancer Registry were analyzed, encompassing 13,552 cases of cervical carcinoma in situ and 6,853 cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed between 2009 and 2013. The study examined the relationship between screening history and five-year cumulative probability of death using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model, adjusting for factors like age, cancer stage, histological type, urbanization level, and treatment received. Screening history was an independent prognostic factor for both invasive cervical cancer and cervical carcinoma in situ, even after adjusting for key confounders. Compared to patients diagnosed within six months of a positive screening result, those diagnosed later or with a negative screening had higher post-diagnosis mortality (adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence interval]: 1.42 [1.26-1.59] for invasive cervical cancer and 1.74 [0.52-5.83] for cervical carcinoma in situ), while never-screened patients had even higher mortality (1.61 [1.42-1.81] for invasive cervical cancer and 5.62 [1.29-24.51] for cervical carcinoma in situ). More advanced age at diagnosis, certain histological types, and living in less urbanized areas correlated with an increased risk of post-diagnosis death. Additionally, the absence of treatment post-diagnosis was significantly associated with worse outcomes. Screening history is a crucial independent prognostic factor for cervical carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer. Patients with a recent positive screening result have a markedly better prognosis than those diagnosed later, those with negative screenings, or unscreened individuals. This study emphasizes the importance of regular and timely cervical cancer screenings in improving prognosis and underscores the need to enhance awareness and accessibility of screening programs.",

  "abstract": "Uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma (UCEC) is a prevalent malignant tumor of the female reproductive system. Despite advancements in molecular biology and treatment strategies, the underlying molecular mechanisms of UCEC tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with UCEC pathogenesis, and to determine potential prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy targets for UCEC. RNA expression datasets and clinical data from UCEC patients were collected from the UCSC Xena database and The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Principal component analysis and LIMMA methods were employed to screen 177 UCEC tissues and 24 normal endometrial tissues. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that up-regulated DEGs were primarily involved in tissue development, cell cycle regulation, and epithelial development. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified DEGs in the blue modules that were significantly positively correlated with UCEC, while DEGs in the black modules were significantly negatively correlated with UCEC. Among the identified DEGs through WGCNA, 16 genes were selected, and further Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that 5 of these genes (AURKA, CCNE1, IQGAP3, TTK, and UBE2C) were significantly negatively correlated with overall survival (OS) and considered as hub genes. The expression of these hub genes was validated using GEO datasets and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis from the human protein atlas. Additionally, the calculation of immune scores for immune infiltration, immune cell infiltration, and immune cell regulation across the 5 hub genes revealed potential immunotherapeutic targets and strategies. This comprehensive investigation provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying UCEC development, identifies 5 promising prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy targets, and offers guidance for UCEC treatment approaches.",

  "abstract": "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Identifying predictors of length of hospital stay (LOS) in PROM patients can aid in improving management and prognosis. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was searched to acquire data on PROM individuals. A univariable analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) were adopted to identify factors closely related to LOS. Next, the change trends in the key variable over multiple time points were determined using a latent class trajectory model (LCTM). The association of these trajectories with LOS was analyzed using GLMs. The retrospective study finally enrolled 868 samples. The significant factors included initial hemoglobin, chorioamnionitis, premature birth, and rupture to delivery interval <24 h. Notably, higher initial hemoglobin level was independently associated with shorter LOS (β = -0.599; 95% CI = [-0.846, -0.352]; p < 0.05). The stratified analysis confirmed this association in all subgroups except those with chorioamnionitis. The LCTM identified three hemoglobin trajectories. Compared to other trajectory groups, the \"lowest, declining\" group had longer LOS (p < 0.05). PROM patients with lower initial hemoglobin levels and the \"lowest, declining\" trajectory group were linked to longer LOS. Monitoring and managing hemoglobin levels is important in improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease defined by endometrial-like tissue (lesions) outside the uterine lining. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, and 9 million women in the US, during reproductive years. Endometriosis has varying clinical presentations; however, 90% of people with endometriosis report pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and 26% report infertility. Risk factors for endometriosis include younger age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, lower body mass index, nulliparity, and congenital obstructive müllerian anomalies such as obstructed hemivagina. Although definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization of lesions, a suspected clinical diagnosis can be made based on symptoms, supported by physical examination findings and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; normal physical examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often delayed, averaging 5 to 12 years after onset of symptoms, with most women consulting 3 or more clinicians prior to diagnosis. Hormonal medications, such as combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only options, are first-line treatment and should be offered to symptomatic premenopausal women who do not currently desire pregnancy. In a network meta-analysis (n = 1680, 15 clinical trials), hormonal treatments including combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists led to clinically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, with mean differences ranging between 13.15 and 17.6 points (0-100 visual analog scale) with little difference in effectiveness among options. However, 11% to 19% of individuals with endometriosis have no pain reduction with hormonal medications and 25% to 34% experience recurrent pelvic pain within 12 months of discontinuing hormonal treatment. Surgical removal of lesions, usually with laparoscopy, should be considered if first-line hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Second-line hormone therapies include GnRH agonists and antagonists, and third-line treatments include aromatase inhibitors. Hysterectomy with surgical removal of lesions may be considered when initial treatments are ineffective. However, approximately 25% of patients who undergo hysterectomy for endometriosis experience recurrent pelvic pain and 10% undergo additional surgery, such as lysis of adhesions, to treat pain. Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. Hormonal suppression with combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins is first-line treatment for women who are not seeking immediate pregnancy. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be performed if hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and hysterectomy may be considered if medical treatments and surgical removal of lesions do not relieve symptoms.",

  "abstract": "The mechanism of the lipid paradox remains uncertain, and malnutrition may be 1 explanation. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the associations between baseline remnant cholesterol (RC) concentrations and clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke, stratified by nutritional status. Patients with ischemic stroke in a single-center prospective cohort (Shanghai, China) from January 2018 to December 2022 were studied. Individuals were classified into 3 groups based on their Controlling Nutritional Status score. Poor outcome and all-cause mortality during up to 3 months of follow-up were compared among patients with varied nutritional status and RC levels utilizing multivariate logistic regression analyses, RC splines, and subgroup analyses. A total of 6892 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the cohort, of which 5257 patients were included in the present study (without malnutrition: 2418 [46.0%]; mild malnutrition: 2516 [47.9%]; moderate-severe malnutrition: 323 [6.1%]). The median age was 69±12 years, and 3398 (64.6%) were male. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition had the highest risks of poor outcome (198 [61.3%];  <0.001) and all-cause mortality (106 [32.8%];  <0.001) during the 3-month follow-up. A higher baseline RC level was an independent protective factor for adverse outcomes in patients with any degree of malnutrition ( <0.05), which was not observed in patients without malnutrition. In addition, compared with the moderate-severely malnourished with RC <0.471 mmol/L, the adjusted odds ratios for poor outcome and all-cause mortality were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.450-1.438) and 0.898 (0.502-1.607) for participants with 0.471 to 0.632 mmol/L, 0.259 (0.095-0.704) and 0.222 (0.061-0.810) for 0.633 to 0.868 mmol/L, and 0.160 (0.037-0.689) and 0.202 (0.042-0.967) for ≥0.869 mmol/L, respectively. The lipid paradox was only observed in the malnourished patients with ischemic stroke. Strict lipid reduction therapy is still recommended for patients without malnutrition. However, when treating patients at any risk of malnutrition, the improvement of nutritional status may be more crucial.",

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of natural compounds in enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments. Baicalin, a bioactive compound from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits significant anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in modulating lung cancer cell behavior through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-mediated ferroptosis pathway. We employed cyber pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to predict and validate the interaction between baicalin and ALOX12. In vitro experiments were conducted on A549 lung cancer cells to assess the effects of baicalin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression levels of ALOX12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis markers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Baicalin treatment significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression in lung cancer cells, and this upregulation was associated with a reduction in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, baicalin-induced ferroptosis was characterized by increased ROS levels, iron accumulation, and elevated expression of GPX4 and ACSL4. These findings suggest that baicalin enhances ferroptosis through ALOX12 activation, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell growth. Baicalin significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression, promoted ferroptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 lung cancer cells. This finding provides evidence for the potential use of baicalin as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer and highlights the importance of ALOX12 in lung cancer treatment strategies.",

Patients were assigned to one of three anesthesia groups: intercostal nerve block (INB), pleural infiltration anesthesia (PIA), or local anesthesia (LA). The primary endpoints were perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse events within 30 days of MWA. Sixty patients (mean age 73.88 ± 6.44 years; 28 men) were included in the analysis. The PIA group had intraoperative VAS scores comparable to the INB group and significantly lower than the LA group (2.70 ± 1.34 vs. 2.85 ± 1.73 vs. 6.26 ± 1.41, respectively). Postoperatively, VAS scores at 2 h were significantly lower in the PIA and INB groups compared to the LA group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the PIA and INB groups (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.35 ± 1.63 vs. 2.25 ± 1.02).

  "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported that one of the major challenges for all countries in the next few years will be the development of preventive approaches to care for older adults. After COVID-19, multimodal interventions have been created to enhance older health, especially targeting respiratory muscles (e.g., inspiratory muscle training [IMT]). The following research aims to explore the combination of two interventions (IMT and Tai Chi) using a randomised, double-blind placebo approach. A total of 30 participants were recruited from the local community in Derby (UK) and underwent an experimental (IMT + Tai Chi) or placebo (sham-IMT + Tai Chi) training protocol. Measurements of balance (i.e., mini-BEST), inspiratory muscle strength (i.e., Maximal Inspiratory Pressure) and mobility (i.e., 6 Minutes Walking Test) were collected at baseline and after 8 weeks. The results show that a combination of IMT and Tai Chi significantly improves dynamic balance (P < 0.01) and mobility (P < 0.05) when compared to Tai Chi alone, with an additional positive correlation between balance, mobility and inspiratory muscle strength (P < 0.05). The manuscript is the first to report the combined effects of IMT and Tai Chi in older adults following rigorous methods. The results highlight the relationship between inspiratory muscle and balance, as the results demonstrate a potential link between metaboreflex and balance control, fostering multimodal practices for healthy ageing interventions.",

Regular exercise can prevent muscle loss, cognitive decline, and comorbidities, potentially reducing fall risk. Given the multifactorial nature of fall risk, a comprehensive assessment is required. To investigate the effects of a 40-week intervention, including a long-term exercise program (16-weeks), detraining (8-weeks), and retraining (16-weeks), on fall risk and cognitive status in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Participants (≥70 years old) were divided into two groups: Elastic Band Resistance Training (EBRT, n = 22) and a control group with no treatment (n = 20). Cognitive profile, body composition, muscle power, and multifactorial fall risk assessments (Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Fall Risk Assessment Tool (FRAT), and sensorimotor platform) were evaluated at four time points. Significant correlations between muscle power, fat-free mass, and cognitive status with fall risk assessments were observed at baseline. Both phases of the exercise intervention improved muscle power, body composition, cognitive profile, and fall risk status. The EBRT group showed significant improvements in muscle power (p ≤ 0.01), fall risk (FRAT, p ≤ 0.01), FES (p ≤ 0.05), sensorimotor performance (p ≤ 0.001), TUG (p ≤ 0.001), and cognitive status (MoCA, p ≤ 0.05). Protective effects persisted during the detraining phase. This study highlights significant improvements in fall risk assessment induced by EBRT, demonstrating its protective effects. The findings suggest that EBRT can enhance aspects related to fall risk, offering promising avenues for improving independence and quality of life in older adults prone to falls.",

Mice were randomly assigned to three groups: normal diet (ND), high-fat diet (HFD), and HFD + 30 mg/kg/day S9P (HFD + S9P). Fasting blood glucose (FBG), intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were conducted to assess blood glucose homeostasis. Morris Water Maze and Y maze tests evaluated cognitive function, and neuronal status was examined through pathological analysis, Golgi staining, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Colonic barrier integrity was assessed using periodic acid-Schiff and Alcian blue staining (AB-PAS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Intestinal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing, and serum metabolic characteristics were determined by metabolomics sequencing. S9P improved glucose homeostasis and alleviated cognitive decline in DACI mice. It also mitigated neuronal damage, dendritic degeneration, and synaptic damage, while restoring colonic barrier integrity and ameliorating gut microbiome imbalances, insulin resistance, and lipid imbalance. Additionally, S9P regulated metabolite profiles and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways, and reduced astrocyte activation and neuroinflammatory responses in the hippocampus of HFD-induced DACI mice. S9P had a protective effect against HFD-induced diabetic cognitive impairment closely related to the modulation of the gut-brain axis, suggesting that S9P has the potential to become a new therapeutic approach for DACI.",

A total of 44 healthy middle-aged and elderly persons (47.1% women) aged over 40 were enrolled in this study. The digital cancellation test (DCT), the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), the Stroop colour-word test, and the trail making test (TMT) are, respectively, associated with four types of attention tasks: sustained attention, divided attention, selective attention, and attention shifting. Functional near-infrared spectroscopic imaging was employed to measure the concentration of brain oxyhaemoglobin in the subjects, while they were performing these four attention tasks. In this study, we found distinct activation patterns in brain areas, such as BA-3, BA-4, BA-6, and others. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the frontal and right parietal lobes consistently showed higher density and strength of connections across tasks, with the PASAT task exhibiting the highest number of connections exceeding the threshold. Notably, the DCT task demonstrated significant correlations in oxygen fluctuations among several brain regions, while the TMT-B task highlighted strong functional connectivity within the bilateral frontal and parietal lobes. This research provides evidence that middle-aged and elderly people have different brain activation and functional connectivity patterns in different attentional tasks, suggesting individualized treatment for attention disorder patients based on impairment type and location.

  "abstract": "Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and care has shown benefits for frail older adults across various care settings. However, its integration into routine care within a surgical context remains limited. An ongoing randomised controlled multicentre study will evaluate the effects of a period of preoperative optimisation (up to eight weeks), involving interprofessional CGA and care, in addition to routine care before colorectal cancer resection surgery. If this approach proves favourable, it could potentially be incorporated into routine surgical care. To facilitate implementation, it is crucial to explore and understand participants' perceptions of taking part in a preoperative CGA and care intervention. To describe how frail older adults with colorectal cancer experience participation in a preoperative CGA and care intervention. This qualitative, descriptive study was part of a randomised controlled multi-centre study. In total, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with frail older adults undergoing a CGA and care intervention before colorectal cancer surgery. The data were analysed using inductive qualitative content analysis. Frail older adults with colorectal cancer experienced participation in preoperative CGA and care as an integral part of an intervention. They adopted an opportunity mindset when deciding to participate. Throughout the intervention, they observed the team working collaboratively and actively involving them in the optimisation process, enhancing their readiness for surgery by the end of the period. The findings indicated that frail older adults with colorectal cancer viewed the preoperative CGA and care intervention as a meaningful opportunity for improvement and a chance to extend life. Their active involvement and the collaborative efforts of the care team during the intervention were crucial in enhancing their understanding, manageability, and readiness for surgery. They valued the opportunity to make active choices when appropriate and appreciated having the right to delegate decisions to healthcare professionals. From a frail older adult's perspective, team-based approaches in preoperative care, such as CGA and care, offer benefits in terms of involvement and satisfaction. However, the thorough evaluation of postoperative outcomes remains necessary. OSF registry: https://osf.io/ch49n , registered on Sep 04, 2023.",

  "abstract": "Based on manual review of clinical notes of using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision coding, we evaluated the feasibility and validity for monitoring, recording, and reporting intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) events in patients with all-cause mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's dementia including, but not limited to, patients eligible for anti-amyloid therapy. Principal and first-position hospital discharge codes for ICH events for 200 patients were identified from the Veterans Affairs Health System structured administrative database. Clinician manual review of discharge summary notes assessed and confirmed the presence of coded events. Available documentation of bleed locations was further reviewed, and the extent of event adjudication for potential etiology was assessed. Additionally, 25 acute ICH cases were randomly identified by reviewing discharge notes to confirm corresponding diagnostic code-based reporting. Of the 200 identified patients, 161 with acute ICH events were confirmed, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80.5% for ICH event presence identified by diagnostic coding. Bleed locations were described for 151 of 161 patients with confirmed events. Of 110 cases whose diagnostic codes indicated an event location, 79 had location descriptions in discharge summaries that were consistent with the coding (PPV = 71.8%). Possible etiology was described in 56/161 patients' discharge summaries. Among the 25 acute ICH cases identified from discharge notes, 8 had corresponding ICH diagnostic codes. This study supports the feasibility and validity of the ICD-10 coding system for monitoring, recording, and reporting ICH event presence. When location is specified in the codes, the ICD-10 coding has an acceptable PPV. Overall, the current diagnostic coding system provides a reasonable framework for initial reporting and may allow for only limited inference of etiology such as differentiating nontraumatic versus traumatic events. Coding accuracy for ICH can be expected to further improve with the availability of guidelines, training, and standardization across clinical practices.",

  "abstract": "Geriatric patients with a hip fracture are at risk for adverse outcomes after surgery. A pilot study showed the feasibility of assessing of systemic inflammation in these patients through neutrophil analysis. The aim of this study was to correlate neutrophil categories to clinical outcomes in a larger cohort. In this prospective cohort study, blood samples were taken from geriatric patients with a hip fracture directly after trauma and healthy older people serving as controls. Neutrophil phenotypes were categorized (0-6 from no inflammation to severe inflammation) and correlated to clinical outcomes. In total, 289 patients (median age 82) and 45 age matched controls were included. Severe infections occurred in 8% of the patients and 9% died within 30 days. Patients displayed all neutrophil categories (0-6), while controls showed categories 0,1,3. A newly identified neutrophil category had higher leukocyte counts and CRP, with trends toward increased infections and mortality. Among patients receiving palliative care, 30-day mortality was 50% in categories 0-1 and 83% in higher categories. Neutrophil categories offer a feasible method to assess systemic inflammation and may assist in shared decision-making for palliative care. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that patients in category 0-1 are deemed fit for surgery, when other risk factors are absent. However, further research should investigate the quality-of-life of patients still alive after 30 days in order to determine whether immune profiling is of added clinical value in decision making regarding traumatic hip fractures in geriatric patients.",

A 43-year-old female with no prior history presented with right-sided otalgia, otorrhea, and hearing loss. At the time of presentation, patient was noted to have an erythematous tympanic membrane, which later developed into an pedunculated lesion on follow up. Imaging showed the lesion involved the Eustachian tube, middle ear and ossicular chain, and tympanic membrane and extended beyond the external auditory meatus. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry stains were negative for hemangiomas, nerve sheath neoplasms, myxoid sarcomas, and supported the final diagnosis of fibroepithelial polyp. The patient underwent surgical excision via a canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy including a facial recess approach with nointra-operative or post-operative complications. Throughout the workup of this case, three distinct pathologic diagnoses were reported for this tumor which highlights the shared pathologic characteristics among benign lesions of the temporal bone. However, all possible diagnoses were in keeping with the final diagnosis of fibroepithelial polyp. This case exhibits an unusually large and rare fibroepithelial polyp of the middle ear and temporal bone. This emphasizes the similarities of clinical and pathologic presentations of benign lesions of the middle ear and temporal bone and the importance of sending complete samples for pathologic diagnosis.",

A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L.

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of natural compounds in enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments. Baicalin, a bioactive compound from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits significant anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in modulating lung cancer cell behavior through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-mediated ferroptosis pathway. We employed cyber pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to predict and validate the interaction between baicalin and ALOX12. In vitro experiments were conducted on A549 lung cancer cells to assess the effects of baicalin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression levels of ALOX12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis markers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Baicalin treatment significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression in lung cancer cells, and this upregulation was associated with a reduction in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, baicalin-induced ferroptosis was characterized by increased ROS levels, iron accumulation, and elevated expression of GPX4 and ACSL4. These findings suggest that baicalin enhances ferroptosis through ALOX12 activation, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell growth. Baicalin significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression, promoted ferroptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 lung cancer cells. This finding provides evidence for the potential use of baicalin as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer and highlights the importance of ALOX12 in lung cancer treatment strategies.",

Patients were assigned to one of three anesthesia groups: intercostal nerve block (INB), pleural infiltration anesthesia (PIA), or local anesthesia (LA). The primary endpoints were perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse events within 30 days of MWA. Sixty patients (mean age 73.88 ± 6.44 years; 28 men) were included in the analysis. The PIA group had intraoperative VAS scores comparable to the INB group and significantly lower than the LA group (2.70 ± 1.34 vs. 2.85 ± 1.73 vs. 6.26 ± 1.41, respectively). Postoperatively, VAS scores at 2 h were significantly lower in the PIA and INB groups compared to the LA group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the PIA and INB groups (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.35 ± 1.63 vs. 2.25 ± 1.02).

Catheter-based therapies (CBT) are emerging technologies that provide reperfusion for patients with PE. However, the optimal timing of these interventions from initial presentation is unknown. This study aimed to determine whether the timing of CBT affects outcomes among patients with acute PE managed with CBT. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with PE who underwent CBT and were included in the Nationwide Readmissions Database between January 2017 and December 2020. Patients who underwent early CBT (≤1 day from admission) were compared with those who underwent delayed CBT (>1 day). The primary outcome was death at 90 days, and secondary outcomes included 90-day readmissions. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression, and propensity score weighting (PSW) was utilised to compare outcomes between early and delayed CBT. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate the risk of primary and readmission outcomes. A total of 12,137 patients were included: 1,992 (16.4%) had high-risk PE, and 1,856 (15.3%) were treated with delayed CBT. After PSW, early CBT was associated with a lower risk of 90-day death in both intermediate-risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.66) and high-risk (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99) PE.

Although previous studies have established nomograms for lung adenocarcinoma, these nomograms do not effectively predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients with bone metastasis. This study aims to establish and validate a new nomogram to solve this problem. Data were collected from the SEER database and from patients at our hospital who had been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and developed bone metastases. The patients were randomly assigned into the training and internal validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. External validation was conducted using an independent patient cohort from two hospitals. Different methods were used to evaluate the nomogram's performance. The relationship between different metastatic sites and radiotherapy and chemotherapy was also analyzed to evaluate patient prognosis. The following factors were identified as significant prognostic indicators: age, sex, marital status, T stage, N stage, tumor grade, tumor size, presence of brain and liver metastases, and receipt of chemotherapy. The nomogram's concordance indices for predicting overall survival were consistently above 0.7, and the area under the curve values, calibration plots, and decision curves all confirmed the nomogram's strong predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analysis revealed that chemotherapy was the most effective treatment modality. This study developed a nomogram that can predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients with bone metastasis. The results showed that patients with liver metastasis had the worst prognosis and that chemotherapy was the most effective treatment regimen for patients with different metastatic sites.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Head lice is a common condition in school-age children caused by Pediculus humanus capitis. Although typically associated with scalp itching and discomfort, chronic or severe infestations can occasionally lead to more severe health consequences. This report describes a 12-year-old boy from Missouri, USA, presenting with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and a severe head lice infestation. IDA is characterized by insufficient iron to meet the body's needs, typically due to blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption. While there is no established causative relationship between head lice and IDA, several case reports have suggested a co-occurrence, often in the absence of other identifiable causes. This raises the possibility that significant lice burden may contribute to or exacerbate IDA, particularly through blood loss from lice feeding on the host's scalp. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with fatigue, pallor, and weakness. Initial outpatient laboratory test data revealed a hemoglobin of 3.4 g/dL, necessitating urgent transportation to the emergency department (ED). Upon examination in the ED, a severe Pediculus humanus capitis infestation was incidentally discovered. Despite extensive inpatient workup, no other source of anemia was identified. The patient was treated with blood transfusions and topical pediculicides to address his anemia and head lice, respectively. Remarkably, his anemia and symptoms resolved without recurrence following these interventions. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged pediculosis capitis with high lice burden should be considered as a potential etiologic factor in patients with unexplained IDA and a negative anemia workup. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms linking these 2 conditions.",

  "abstract": "To evaluate thoraco-laparoscopic McKeown esophagectomy (TLME) versus endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for clinical-T1N0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) depending on invasion depth. Early-stage ESCC has been widely treated by endoscopic resection. While ESD is safer than esophagectomy perioperatively, its survival benefits for clinical-T1N0M0 ESCC, especially high-risk T1b tumors, are unclear. A retrospective study was conducted on clinical-T1N0 ESCC patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University comparing TLME (cT1a, n = 352; cT1b, n = 205) with ESD (cT1a, n = 499; cT1b, n = 62). Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) were analyzed depending on invasion depth after propensity score matching to account for selection bias. ESD group had better OS (hazard ratio: 0.54, p = 0.029) but worse RFS (hazard ratio: 6.83, p < 0.001) than TLME group in general terms. T1a cancers showed no difference in DSS and MFS between groups. T1b subgroup with ESD had lower DSS (hazard ratio: 5.65, p = 0.036) and MFS (hazard ratio: 3.54, p = 0.069). R1-resection in ESD group linked to poorer OS (hazard ratio: 5.89, p = 0.006) and DSS (hazard ratio: 3.67, p = 0.006). ESD can be safe in the treatment of clinical-T1aN0 ESCC. However, concerning oncologic curability, TLME should be recommended for patients with clinical-T1bN0 ESCC in terms of favorable DSS, RFS, and MFS.",

U937, THP-1, HL60 and K562 cells were cultured  . The cells in logarithmic growth phase (l×10   cells/well) were added with  F-FDG, and the uptake rate of  F-FDG was measured at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after addation, respectively. The four kinds of cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the hind limbs of nude mice to establish a tumor-bearing nude mouse model. When the tumor size was about 500 mm ,  F-FDG was injected through the tail vein of the mice, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed at 60 min after injection. The morphology of tumor-bearing cells was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining in serial pathological sections. After co-incubation with  F-FDG, the  F-FDG uptake rates of U937 cells were significantly higher than THP-1, HL60 and K562 cells at 4 time points (all   <0.05), and THP-1 cells were higher than K562 cells (all   <0.05). The uptake rate of  F-FDG by leukemia cells was rapid in the first 60 min, then tended to be stable. Pathological analysis showed that subcutaneous inoculation of U937, THP-1, HL60 and K562 cells could successfully establish tumor-bearing nude mouse models of myeloid leukemia. The  F-FDG uptake value in U937 tumor-bearing nude mice was significantly higher than THP-1, HL60 and K562 tumor-bearing nude mice (all   <0.01). The  F-FDG uptake values in THP-1 and HL60 tumor-bearing nude mice were significantly higher than that in K562 tumor-bearing nude mice (both   <0.01). The tumor-bearing nude mouse model of myeloid leukemia can be successfully constructed by subcutaneous inoculation. The  F-FDG uptake rate of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is higher in cells cultured in vitro and tumor-bearing nude mouse model.  F-FDG may have better clinical application value for AML.

F-FDG与不同类型髓系白血病细胞共同孵育后，U937细胞在4个时间点的摄取率均明显高于THP-1、HL60、K562细胞（均   <0.05）；THP-1细胞在4个时间点的摄取率均高于K562细胞（均   <0.05）；前60 min内白血病细胞对 F-FDG的摄取速度较快，60 min之后摄取速度趋于稳定。成功构建了U937、THP-1、HL60、K562白血病细胞荷瘤裸鼠模型，U937荷瘤裸鼠对 F-FDG摄取值均明显高于THP-1、HL60、K562荷瘤裸鼠（均   <0.01）；THP-1和HL60荷瘤裸鼠对 F-FDG摄取值明显高于K562荷瘤裸鼠（均   <0.01）。. 通过皮下接种法成功构建髓系白血病荷瘤裸鼠模型，在体外培养的细胞和荷瘤裸鼠模型中，急性髓系白血病细胞对 F-FDG摄取率较高， F-FDG可能对急性髓系白血病具有更好的临床应用价值。.",

  "abstract": "To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic responses and prognostic features of   fusion gene for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L. The main immunophenotype was common-B ALL (44 cases, 91.7%). Other leukemia fusion genes such as   and   were not observed in this cohort of patients. All patients received the treatment of NPCLC-ALL2008 protocol, and 5 cases (10.4%) occurred poor prednisone response. All the 48 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction treatments. The last follow-up date was April 30, 2023. A total of 5 children relapsed, including 1 case with intermediate risk and 4 cases with high risk. The recurrence rate in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the intermediate- and low-risk groups (both   < 0.05). Most relapsed children had elevated WBC counts at initial diagnosis. Among them, WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was observed in 4 cases. The recurrence rate among children with WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was significantly higher than that with WBC counts <100×10 /L (  < 0.01). Four deaths occurred in this cohort, of which 3 died of leukemia recurrence. The 10-year event-free survival rate and 10-year overall survival rate of the 48 children with positive   fusion gene were 87.5%±4.8% and 91.7%±4.0%, respectively. In ALL children with positive   fusion gene, those with elevated WBC counts and high risk stratification at initial diagnosis are more likely to experience recurrence. Recurrence is the main cause of death in this group. It is suggested that such kind of children receive more intensive chemotherapy or undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as early as possible to further improve prognosis.  融合基因阳性儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病临床特点及预后分析. 探讨儿童   融合基因阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的临床特点、治疗反应及预后特征。. 回顾性分析2010年7月至2017年11月于本院初诊的ALL患儿837例，实时荧光定量PCR技术检测出   阳性患儿48例，收集其临床资料进行分析。. 48例   融合基因阳性患儿中男26例，女22例，发病年龄9个月-13岁。初诊低危、中危及高危分别为2例（4.2%）、32例（66.7%）和14例（29.1%）。初诊外周血白细胞数<50×10 /L者25例（53.2%），(50-100)×10 /L者11例（23.4%），≥100×10 /L者11例（23.4%）。免疫表型主要是以common-B ALL为主（44例，占91.7%）。48例   阳性患儿未检测到  等其他白血病融合基因。所有患儿均接受中国儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病2008方案治疗，其中，泼尼松反应不良者5例（10.4%）。48例患儿在诱导治疗结束后均获得完全缓解。至随访截止时间（2023年4月30日），共5例患儿出现复发，其中中危1例、高危4例，高危组患儿的复发率明显高于中、低危组（均  < 0.05）；绝大多数复发患儿初诊白细胞数较高，其中4例≥100×10 /L，初诊白细胞数≥100×10 /L组患儿的复发率明显高于<100×10 /L组（  < 0.01）。本组共有4例患儿死亡，其中因白血病复发导致死亡的患儿有3例。48例   融合基因阳性患儿10年无事件生存率及10年总生存率分别为87.5%±4.8%、91.7%±4.0%。. 在   融合基因阳性ALL患儿中，初诊白细胞计数高及危险度分层较高的患儿更容易出现复发，复发是患儿的主要死亡原因，建议此类患儿接受更高强度的化疗或尽早进行造血干细胞移植以进一步改善其预后。.",

The aim of our research was to find out reliable landmarks for the surgical access of the facial nerve trunk (FNT). Our study was conducted on 75 hemifaces of adult embalmed cadavers. Prior to anatomical dissection, the cephalometric type of each head was determined and the landmarks identified for study have been established. For the FNT surgical access, 8 landmarks were measured and statistically analyzed on 5 criteria: gender, laterality, cephalometric type, branching pattern and its variant (classic/atypical). Six of the examined landmarks showed statistical significance depending on gender (p ≤ 0.05) among which were: angle of the FNT bifurcation (FNTB); distance between the FNT division and the angle of the mandible (FNTD/AM); distance between the FNT division and the apex of the mastoid process (FNTD/AMP); distance between the FNT origin and the intertragic notch (FNTO/ITN); distance between the FNT origin and the triangular prominence of the cartilage of the external acoustic meatus (FNTO/∆CEAM); distance between the FNT origin and the anterior margin of the sternocleidomastoid muscle insertion point (FNTO/AMSCMIP). The angle formed at the intersection of the facial nerve trunk with the vertical line drawn through the anterior margin of the external acoustic meatus (FNT/VEAM), was statistically significant depending on laterality (p = 0.049). The FNT bifurcation angle was also statistically significant depending on the branching pattern (p = 0.005). Although seven of the studied landmarks were statistically significant based on at least one of the examined criteria, the limitations of the research include: a small number of samples, predominance of the male hemifaces, and prevalence of the mesocephalic type individuals.",

  "abstract": "Exposure to air pollution and meteorological conditions, such as humidity, has been linked to adverse respiratory health outcomes in children. This study aims to develop predictive models for pediatric hospitalizations based on both environmental exposures and clinical features. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2500 children (aged 1-18) who presented with respiratory symptoms at the emergency department, during 2016-2017. Air pollution data, including NOx and NO  concentrations, and relative humidity (RH) were collected from nine monitoring stations and were cross-referenced with the children's residential locations to assess their specific exposure level. Statistical tests, including Chi-square and Wilcoxon tests, were used to analyze the data. Machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were developed to predict the children's hospitalizations. Boys were more likely to be hospitalized than girls (60.6% vs. 39.4%, p = 4.31e-06). Hospital visits peaked during winter (p = 3.56e-37). Increased emergency room visits were statistically significantly associated with highly polluted days (p = 0.038). Hospitalized children were exposed to lower RH (median 64.9%) compared to nonhospitalized children (median 69.4%, p = 0.005). The RF and XGBoost models were reliable, with accuracy rates of 0.7-0.98, Precision scores of 0.88-0.99, and AUC scores of 81%-99%. Key features included temperature, NOx levels, RH, and exposure to SO . This study investigates the effects of air pollution and humidity on pediatric respiratory health. The models developed offer valuable tools for predicting hospitalizations and are intended to support public health planning and resource allocation.",

All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

  "abstract": "Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Catheter-based therapies (CBT) are emerging technologies that provide reperfusion for patients with PE. However, the optimal timing of these interventions from initial presentation is unknown. This study aimed to determine whether the timing of CBT affects outcomes among patients with acute PE managed with CBT. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with PE who underwent CBT and were included in the Nationwide Readmissions Database between January 2017 and December 2020. Patients who underwent early CBT (≤1 day from admission) were compared with those who underwent delayed CBT (>1 day). The primary outcome was death at 90 days, and secondary outcomes included 90-day readmissions. Propensity scores were estimated using logistic regression, and propensity score weighting (PSW) was utilised to compare outcomes between early and delayed CBT. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to estimate the risk of primary and readmission outcomes. A total of 12,137 patients were included: 1,992 (16.4%) had high-risk PE, and 1,856 (15.3%) were treated with delayed CBT. After PSW, early CBT was associated with a lower risk of 90-day death in both intermediate-risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.66) and high-risk (HR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80-0.99) PE. Early CBT was associated with lower rates of all-cause readmission in patients with intermediate-risk PE (HR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95) and in those with high-risk PE (HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.69-1.05). Among patients with intermediate- or high-risk PE, early CBT was associated with a lower risk of 90-day death and readmission. A further prospective study on the optimal timing for reperfusion using CBT is needed.",

  "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death globally in children aged 0-5 years. Early access to pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in low-resource, pre-hospital settings may result in improved pediatric pneumonia outcomes. However, few data exist regarding their application in such settings. We performed an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to examine use of pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in pre-hospital environments of Malawi. Our model yielded an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for pre-hospital pulse-oximetry use of $35 (USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared to no pulse-oximetry use. One-way sensitivity analysis showed highest sensitivity to the parameter of downstream hospitalization cost. Given that inpatient management is the standard of care for hypoxemic pneumonia, when only pre-hospital costs were considered the result was an ICER of $9.9/DALY averted. Both values were considered cost-effective according to a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold set for 1x the average GDP per capita in Malawi ($588, 2018). When oxygen was analyzed in combination with pulse-oximetry, we found a baseline WTP threshold for pre-hospital oxygen of $71 per patient. For every 1% reduction in total pediatric pneumonia mortality consequent to pre-hospital oxygen use, we determined the recommended WTP allowance for oxygen would increase by approximately $4.53. We conclude that pulse-oximetry is likely cost-effective in low-resource, pre-hospital environments. We acknowledge the need for further research on the effectiveness of pre-hospital oxygen in reducing pediatric pneumonia mortality and suggest ranges of cost and efficacy for which oxygen is likely to be found cost-effective in tandem with pulse-oximetry.",

A subgroup analysis of our prior Phase II trial showed that muscadine grape skin extract (MPX) increased PSA doubling time (PSADT) in patients with SOD2 Ala/Ala variant which provided the rationale for this trial. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at 14 sites, evaluated patients with BCRPC and SOD2 Ala/Ala genotype. Patients received 4000 mg MPX or placebo daily. The primary endpoint was on-study PSA slope with comparisons between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints were PSADT, PSA response (≥ 50% decrease), and PSA progression free survival (PFS). Correlative studies included markers of oxidative stress and gastrointestinal microbiota composition. At interim analysis, fifty-nine patients were randomized (MPX, n = 29; placebo, n = 30). On-study PSA slopes at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks showed no significant differences between the MPX and placebo arms (p = 0.49). The study was stopped due to futility. No significant differences were observed in PSADT, PSA response, median PSA PFS, or oxidative stress biomarkers. MPX was well-tolerated, with no grade 3-4 AEs attributable to the study drug. Microbiome analysis showed no significant differences in alpha diversity but revealed increased relative abundance of Roseburia faecis and Akkermansia muciniphila in the MPX group. Although MPX supplementation had no significant effect on PSA slope in men with BCRPC and SOD2 Ala/Ala variant, this study provides a rigorous evaluation of a natural product and highlights the importance of well-designed clinical trials in advancing evidence-based integrative oncology.

Of 200 consecutively recruited children with a previously proven diagnosis of PBB 62 (12.2 years, female 48%) were interviewed after 7.7 (5.4-14.7) years about their previous and current symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs: spirometry, body plethysmography, nitrogen multi-breath washout, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide) were performed. Children with persistent symptoms were offered lung imaging. 11 (17.7%) patients suffered from chronic or recurring wet cough years after their first PBB episode. 15 (24.19%) had at least one abnormal spirometry parameter. FEV1 was abnormal in eight of 62 (12.9%), LCI 2.5% in seven of 56 (12.5%), FVC in 12 of 62 (19.35%) and FEV1/FVC in five of 62 (8.06%) cases. PFT did not differ between children with and without wet cough. Lung MRI/CT demonstrate in four of nine cases abnormalities of the bronchial walls, including one with incipient bronchiectasis. After PBB in early childhood, a significant proportion of children suffer from respiratory symptoms many years later, some have an objectively reduced lung function and structural changes of the bronchial wall despite adequate initial therapy. Wet cough alone seems not to be a sensitive clinical predictor. Due to the retrospective study design, we cannot proof any causal relationship. However, to detect late bronchopulmonary sequelae, continuous follow-up of these children should become mandatory.",

  "abstract": "Chemotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) has not achieved the desired outcome due to inefficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and limited tumor-specific drug accumulation. Strategies that employ bioinspired nanoparticles to enhance targeted drug accumulation can help improve therapeutic efficacy. In this work, a novel nanoparticle, PCM@TMA-lip, exhibiting hybrid-targeting capabilities, is presented, with an engineered cell membrane coated on a lipid core. The membrane modified with a biologically derived peptide enables PCM@TMA-lip to evade immune clearance and enable precise tumor targeting. The lipid core with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-conjugated Temozolomide (TMZ) enhances FABP7-mediated uptake, promotes lysosomal escape via lipid peroxidation, and reduces tumor migration and drug resistance. In vitro, PCM@TMA-lip inhibited tumor cell malignancy and suppressed the growth of 3D spheroids. In vivo, it suppressed tumor progression, reduced Ki67  proliferation, increased TUNEL  apoptosis, and prolonged survival in GBM-bearing mice, highlighting its potential as an effective strategy to improve GBM chemotherapy.",

  "abstract": "Long-term neurodevelopment of moderate and late preterm infants (MLPTI; gestational age [GA] 32 0/7 weeks to 36 6/7 weeks) is at a lower level than that of those at term age. Increased protein and energy intakes in the first week of life have been associated with better neurodevelopment early in life, in very preterm infants. This study aimed to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcome of MLPTI at 2 years corrected age (CA) for prematurity (i.e., after term equivalent age) and its association with nutritional intake in the first week of life. We prospectively collected nutritional data during the first week of life from 100 MLPTI (GA 32 0/7 weeks to 35 6/7 weeks). At 2 years CA, children underwent a neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third edition, Dutch version (BSID-III-NL). The mean BSID-III-NL (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) score was 103.1 (10.9) on the cognitive composite, 101.1 (SD ± 15.0) on the language composite, and 100.8 (SD ± 9.6) on the motor composite. Boys scored significantly lower than girls on both cognitive and language composite scores. We found no significant associations between nutritional intake in the first week of life and neurodevelopment at 2 years CA. Neurodevelopment at 2 years CA was within normal limits, while boys scored lower than girls. First week nutritional intakes do not seem to be associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years CA. This study emphasizes the need for more long-term follow-up and research concerning neurodevelopment in MLPTI, especially in boys.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Head lice is a common condition in school-age children caused by Pediculus humanus capitis. Although typically associated with scalp itching and discomfort, chronic or severe infestations can occasionally lead to more severe health consequences. This report describes a 12-year-old boy from Missouri, USA, presenting with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and a severe head lice infestation. IDA is characterized by insufficient iron to meet the body's needs, typically due to blood loss, nutritional deficiencies, or malabsorption. While there is no established causative relationship between head lice and IDA, several case reports have suggested a co-occurrence, often in the absence of other identifiable causes. This raises the possibility that significant lice burden may contribute to or exacerbate IDA, particularly through blood loss from lice feeding on the host's scalp. CASE REPORT A 12-year-old boy presented to his pediatrician with fatigue, pallor, and weakness. Initial outpatient laboratory test data revealed a hemoglobin of 3.4 g/dL, necessitating urgent transportation to the emergency department (ED). Upon examination in the ED, a severe Pediculus humanus capitis infestation was incidentally discovered. Despite extensive inpatient workup, no other source of anemia was identified. The patient was treated with blood transfusions and topical pediculicides to address his anemia and head lice, respectively. Remarkably, his anemia and symptoms resolved without recurrence following these interventions. CONCLUSIONS Prolonged pediculosis capitis with high lice burden should be considered as a potential etiologic factor in patients with unexplained IDA and a negative anemia workup. Further research is warranted to explore the mechanisms linking these 2 conditions.",

A modified MeDiC scoring system was applied in 8955 subjects with localized (T1-T4N0M0) or metastasized disease as per the Bladder Cancer Data Base Sweden (BladderBaSe) 2.0. Association between MeDiC score and not being discussed at MDTM was investigated by multivariable logistic regression, and further explored in relation to calendar time period, healthcare region, age at diagnosis and hospital volume. Median total MeDiC score was lower in individuals not being discussed at an MDTM (7.0 Inter Quartile Range [IQR] 6.0-9.0) compared to those who were (8.0 IQR 6.0-10.0). Adjusted odds ratio for not being discussed at an MDTM was 2.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-2.4) for a MeDiC score in the lower quartile, as compared to the highest quartile, with higher estimates when performing stratified analyses in later calendar years and in specific healthcare regions. Our data indicate that the MeDiC score is applicable in bladder cancer patients, and we identified an association between lower MeDiC score and not being discussed at an MDTM.",

  "abstract": "The effect of exercise on homocysteine (Hcy) levels is multifaceted and varies significantly across different populations. This review investigates how various exercise modalities-moderate to vigorous physical activity, acute intense exercise, aerobic exercise, and resistance training-affect Hcy concentrations, alongside the influence of demographic and health-related factors. Generally, moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with lower Hcy levels, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk. In contrast, acute high-intensity exercises may temporarily increase Hcy levels due to immediate metabolic responses and oxidative stress. The effects of exercise on Hcy levels are influenced by age, sex, baseline health status, nutritional intake, fitness level, exercise type, and genetic factors. Aerobic exercise has been shown to improve cardiovascular and neuroprotective outcomes but may not significantly affect Hcy levels in the long term. Conversely, resistance training demonstrates varied effects, with some studies indicating significant reductions in Hcy levels, particularly in specific populations like overweight older adults, while others show negligible changes. Overall, while evidence supports the beneficial role of regular physical activity in modulating Hcy levels, the relationship is complex and affected by multiple factors. Further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms and optimize exercise recommendations for different populations to control Hcy levels and associated health risks effectively.",

This multicenter retrospective study included 179 uHCC patients with Child-Pugh B (CP7 group: n = 106; CP8/9 group: n = 73), receiving a combination of lenvatinib/sorafenib/other TKIs and PD-1 inhibitors between December 2020 and March 2023. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were defined as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and safety. The median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 7.3 months (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 6.3-8.3) and 16.0 months (95% CI: 12.9-19.1), respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between CP7 and CP8/9 groups in PFS (7.8 vs. 6.3 months, p = 0.28), OS (17.8 vs. 14.0 months, p = 0.20), ORR (33.0% vs. 27.4%, p = 0.42), or safety profiles.

  "abstract": "Digital health technology (DHT)-based psychological interventions are emerging as a means to enhance psychological outcomes for cancer survivors. This study aims to assess the effects of DHT-based psychological interventions on anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life among cancer survivors. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool RoB 2 was used to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist was used to check if the interventions reviewed were described in detail to be implemented in the clinical setting. Data synthesis was conducted in Review Manager (Version 5.4), and the effect size was calculated by the standardized mean difference and its 95% confidence interval. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. The certainty of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. This meta-analysis encompassed 46 randomized controlled trials, involving 5211 participants. DHT-based psychological interventions significantly reduced anxiety (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.59/-0.24), depression (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.39/-0.13), sleep disturbance (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI -0.64/-0.14), fatigue (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI -0.77/-0.17), and improved quality of life (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI 0.22/0.62). Subgroup analysis indicated that interventions lasting for a duration of ≥ 12 weeks, and integrated interventions might be the most effective in addressing adverse psychological outcomes. And cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions demonstrated significant effectiveness in managing sleep disturbance. DHT-based psychological interventions might be effective for improving anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, and quality of life in cancer survivors. We cannot draw definitive conclusions due to intervention and study design heterogeneity. Further rigorous trials are crucial to identify optimal interventions for different types of cancers, determine suitable durations, specify types of DHT-based psychological interventions and validate intervention therapies.",

A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases to identify the relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Nine RCTs involving 1,157 patients were included. For primary efficacy, rituximab had a lower relapse rate than azathioprine (AZA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (odds ratio (OR): 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.84 and OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08-0.68, respectively). Based on the result of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), rituximab had the highest probability of reducing relapse (SUCRA = 86.6%), followed by cyclophosphamide (CYC), belimumab + AZA, methotrexate (MTX), AZA, and MMF. Regarding major relapse, rituximab also showed the highest probability (SUCRA = 93.6%). Concerning safety, there were no significant differences in the incidence of SAEs and serious infection among the different medicines. According to the SUCRA, MMF had the lowest probability of SAEs and serious infection. In conclusion, rituximab may be a treatment method for effectively reducing relapses in AAV patients during maintenance therapy among the medicines investigated.

Days of app use were correlated with reported patient-reported outcomes of interest, ease of use, the utility of features, and importance of features. Of 293 enrolled participants, 284 remained active in the study, and 206 (72.5%) completed the 24-week MARS survey. App Interest was positively correlated with app use (p = 0.01) and self-reported days of app use (p = 0.0008). Perceived ease of use trended toward significance with greater app use (p = 0.06). Most individuals (72.0%, 144/200) agreed the app helped them remember to take hydroxyurea, with trends toward higher days of app use (p = 0.07). Those who used the app more agreed they would continue to use it after the study (p = 0.04). Most individuals (54.3%) reported that reminders to take their hydroxyurea were the most important app feature. In this study, positive perceptions toward the application features influenced app use and intention to continue using the application.

Since the behavior of Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) is potentially affected by plasma-derived exosomes, this study aimed to investigate whether the plasma-derived exosome of young and elderly human donors can deliver \"youth\" or \"aging\" signals into human umbilical cord blood-derived HSCs in vitro. Exosomes were isolated from four young (Y-exo) and four old (O-exo) donors. Umbilical cord blood-derived HSCs were exposed to two concentrations of exosomes (5 and 10 μg/mL). Then, lineage differentiation (CD41 and CD38), the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1β and IL- 6, and NFκB activity were evaluated using flow cytometry, qRT-PCR Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) methods, and western blot techniques, respectively. The lineage-specific markers CD41 and CD38 expression were increased after exposure to O-exo compared to Y-exo at the concentration of 10 μg/mL (P<0.001). The HSCs treated with 10 μg/mL O-exo increased protein and mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-6 compared to Y-exo at 10 μg/mL concentration (P<0.01). Furthermore, a significant difference was seen in p-NF-κB levels between O-exo and Y-exo at the concentration of 10 μg/mL (P=0.0014). Our findings advocated the concept that circulating exosomes of old and young individuals may differently affect the pathways involved in the aging process in HSCs.Therefore, exosomes may be applied as therapeutic agents for regenerative medicine.",

  "abstract": "Magnetically controlled growing rods (MCGRs) have become the current standard in the growth-friendly treatment of patients with early-onset scoliosis (EOS). MCGRs allow noninvasive lengthenings with external lengthening device and reduce the need for surgical procedures. The association of preoperative body mass index (BMI) and the outcomes of the MCGR treatment is not well known. Prospectively collected international database was reviewed for EOS patients treated with MCGR. Patients without preoperative BMI data or follow-up <2 years were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy weight, overweight, and underweight using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Quality of life was assessed using EOSQ-24. Results were analyzed from the 2-year follow-up. A total of 663 patients were categorized into underweight (n=91), healthy weight (n=417), and overweight (n=155) groups. There were no significant differences in major curve correction or thoracic height increase among the BMI groups, irrespective of etiology. Distribution of BMI categories differed significantly by etiology (P=0.009), with lower healthy weight proportions in the syndromic group (92/167, 55%) compared with idiopathic (131/177, 74%) (adjusted P=0.004), and a higher underweight proportion in neuromuscular (36/244, 15%) compared with idiopathic (15/177, 8.5%) (adjusted P=0.044). Higher BMI z-scores were associated with an increased incidence of complications, including implant-related complications (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.3) and implant breakage (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.7). Healthy weight and underweight patients experienced lower overall complication rates compared with overweight patients. Implant-related complications were less common in underweight patients compared with overweight patients (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.90). Higher BMI z-score was a significant predictor of implant breakage, whereas preoperative major curve, kyphosis, and etiology were not. EOSQ-24 scores did not differ significantly among BMI groups, and changes in scores were comparable across groups during follow-up. BMI status did not influence curve correction, thoracic height increase, or EOSQ-24 outcomes in early-onset scoliosis patients. However, the higher incidence of implant breakage in overweight patients suggests that elevated BMI should be carefully considered when planning treatment. Level III.",

  "abstract": "Eliciting ferroptotic cell death in tumors has enhanced prospects for cancer therapy because of its proinflammatory properties, which enable damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release and immune response activation. However, the immunogenicity of ferroptosis and how to controllably activate the self-enhanced antitumor immune response by cellular ferroptosis require further investigation. In this study, a piezoelectric BaTiO -based ferroptosis inducer (BTO@Fe) is synthesized for effective cancer immunotherapy. BTO@Fe induces moderate ferroptosis by introducing excess iron and catalyzing the Fenton reaction. When subjected to ultrasound (US) irradiation, the piezoelectrically excited electrons and holes are separated, further catalyzing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) consumption and consequently causing intensified ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). Moreover, activated CD8  T cells respond to immune signals by releasing interferon gamma (IFNγ), which sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis in an intrinsic mechanism of ferroptosis initiation. The robust ferroptosis originating from exogenous piezocatalytic reactions and the endogenous immune responses demonstrates satisfactory in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects. This work suggests that doping-engineered piezoelectric materials with augmented catalytic activity are promising countermeasures for restoring immunogenicity in ferroptotic cells.",

This study examines differences in sex and age related TBI epidemiology in a high-volume trauma centre intensive care unit (ICU) cohort, aiming to identify potential targets for prevention. This retrospective, single centre study includes all consecutive TBI patients admitted to the ICU in a 4-year study period. Patient demographics, comorbidities, co-medication, trauma setting and associated risk behaviour were compared between sexes and age groups (over/under 65 years). 592 patients (73.3% male, 26.7% female) were included. The leading cause of TBI was falls (52.4%), followed by road traffic accidents (RTA) (35.8%). Overall, men were more likely to suffer from a road traffic accident, while women were more likely to suffer a low energy fall. No differences in injury severity and comorbidities between sexes were observed. Young patients most likely suffered from a RTA while older patients from a low energy fall irrespective of sex. Both sexes portrayed risk associated behaviors with higher rates of alcohol intoxication in males, while females were less likely to wear a helmet in two-wheeled RTAs. We conclude that sex- and age-related epidemiologic differences in TBI exist. Our results suggest that sex and age-specific prevention measures might be advisable for optimal mitigation of TBI and its sequelae.",

  "abstract": "The VINCat program, established in Catalonia, Spain, in 2006, is a comprehensive infection prevention program for healthcare-associated infections. This study aims to analyze long-term trends in periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) following primary hip and knee arthroplasties over 15-year period (2008-2022). PJI was defined according to CDC-NHSN criteria and updated in 2016 to incorporate the Musculoskeletal Infection Society classification. Data on PJI following total hip arthroplasty (THA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), and hip hemiarthroplasty (HHA) were prospectively collected and analyzed across three periods: 2008-2012, 2013-2017, and 2018-2022. Sixty-seven hospitals participated in the surveillance, reporting 189,063 procedures, including 61,267 THA (median age: 69 years, 47% female), 115,940 TKA (median age: 73 years, 68% female), and 11,856 HHA (median age: 86 years, 73% females). PJI incidence rates for THA were 0.9%, 1.1%, and 1.2% across the three periods (odds ratio (OR):1.14, 95% CI: 0.96-1.35). For TKA, rates were 0.9%, 1.0%, and 0.9% (OR:0.95, 95% CI: 0.83-1.09). The incidence of HHA-PJI declined from 3.4% to 2.3% and 1.8% (OR:0.77, 95% CI:0.58-1.03). Overall, the most common etiology was coagulase negative staphylococci followed by Staphylococcus aureus. PJIs were diagnosed after hospital discharge in 87.1% of THA, 89.6% of TKA, and 73.9% of HHA. The incidence of PJI remains low despite an aging population undergoing orthopedic surgery, highlighting the effectiveness of current infection prevention strategies. A robust, long-term surveillance system is crucial for monitoring epidemiological trends and guiding the implementation of evidence-based preventive measures.",

  "abstract": "Traumatic hemipelvectomy (TH) is a rare and extremely severe injury of the pelvic area, which is often life-threatening and associated with a high mortality rate. Individual treatment is focused on the pelvic fracture and the type of accompanying injuries. The management of these severely injured patients places a considerable challenge on the resuscitation team. Patient management should be aggressive from the start. Current literature is focused predominantly on survivors, with only few case series providing possible treatment recommendations. Aggressive initial treatment is focused on standardized damage-control procedures during the prehospital, emergency room, and initial surgical phase to prevent exsanguination and contamination; a massive transfusion protocol should also be initiated immediately to address traumatic coagulopathy. Standard vascular treatment addresses the vascular injury. Colostomy is often recommended for adequate soft-tissue trauma management. Attempts at limb salvage often result in higher complications rates with non-functional limbs compared with completion of the TH. Thus, in cases of critical ischemia and identified relevant sacral nervous plexus injury during initial debridement in predominantly open injuries, primary completion of the hemipelvectomy is recommended.

  "abstract": "Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a rare disease characterized by narrowing of the upper airway and affects near-exclusively females. Patients often experience recurrent disease and require repeated surgical dilations. The pathophysiology underlying the broad spectrum of disease severity within iSGS remains unknown. In the current study, we sought to identify transcriptomic differences between iSGS patients with markedly different recurrence rates. Prospectively collected clinical and bulk RNA sequencing data from subglottic tissues of 56 female iSGS patients with 1-4 years of follow-up were analyzed. DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis, comparing samples from the highest (1.19-1.87 dilations/year) versus the lowest (0.30-0.65 dilations/year) quartile of surgical dilation rate (i.e., high vs. low recurrence groups). In total, 220 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the high and low recurrence groups (adjusted p < 0.1 and log  fold change > |1|). Pathway enrichment analyses showed that the high recurrence group had significantly increased expression of genes involved in adaptive immune responses (e.g., immunoglobulin subunit genes) and extracellular matrix organization (e.g., COMP, NID2) (adjusted p < 0.1). In contrast, the low recurrence group had significantly increased expression of genes involved in cilia structure and function (e.g., CFAP43, DNAI2) (adjusted p < 0.1), suggesting a relatively increased abundance of respiratory cilia. Transcriptomic profiling suggests that lower recurrence rates in iSGS are associated with retention of respiratory cilia, while adaptive immune responses and increased extracellular matrix deposition are present in those with higher recurrence rates. These results hold promise for the development of prognostic markers and identification of therapeutic targets for iSGS.",

The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the current treatments of simple elbow dislocations to identify the best non-surgical and surgical management for patients with simple elbow dislocations (SED). A review of the literature was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and Google Scholar databases was performed using the following keywords: \"elbow dislocation\", \"simple elbow dislocation\", \"traumatic elbow dislocation\", \"treatment\", \"management\", \"reduction\", \"rehabilitation\", \"functional outcome\", \"range of motion\", \"complications\", \"recovery time\" over the years 1976-2024. The literature search and cross-referencing resulted in a total of 345 references, of which 283 were rejected due to off-topic abstract and/or failure to fulfil the inclusion criteria. After reading the remaining full-text articles, we included 60 studies, investigating non-surgical management or surgical management of simple elbow dislocations. The SMDA-SEC consensus panel provided recommendations to improve the management of patients with SED in clinical practice. Early mobilization is recommended for all cases of simple elbow dislocations. The CMA-EC panel was unable to advise or against the short-period (1-3-wk) immobilization, prolonged (3-wk) immobilization or operative treatment due to insufficient or conflicting evidence.",

  "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common male sexual dysfunction characterized by short ejaculatory latency with minimal stimulation, an inability to delay or control ejaculation, and distress or dissatisfaction due to the condition. Pharmacological therapy is central to PE management, with dapoxetine as the only approved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Off-label options, including long-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg, paroxetine), topical anesthetics, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil), and tramadol, have also been explored. Despite numerous systematic reviews on its treatment, challenges remain due to methodological heterogeneity, variability in outcome measures, and inconsistencies in trial quality, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. This umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SR-MAs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examined the efficacy of pharmacological treatments in prolonging intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) and their safety by analyzing associated adverse events in adults with PE. A comprehensive search of SR-MAs ranging from 1990 to 2024 was performed. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed quality of previous SR-MAs using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews version 2 (AMSTAR-2) tool and the risk of bias of RCTs using Cochrane's risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. The primary outcome of interest was IELT. Effect sizes from primary studies of all SR-MAs were extracted, and after removing overlapping RCTs, a re-meta-analysis was conducted. We appraised evidence certainty using the Grading of recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations scoring system (GRADE). This review included 44 SR-MAs covering 65 RCTs. Only two SR-MAs rated as moderate to high quality in the AMSTAR-2 assessment. Additionally, only six out of 65 RCTs had a low risk of bias. The median follow-up for included RCTs was 7.9 months. These treatments significantly improved IELT compared to placebo, with paroxetine achieving the largest mean difference (5.64 min; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.50 to 9.07). However, all pharmacological treatments were associated with adverse events, with paroxetine having the lowest risk (RR: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.3 to 7.3), while risk ratios were higher for other treatments, including 4.1 for topical anesthetics, 2.4 for tramadol, and 1.8 for dapoxetine. Only topical anesthetics and paroxetine demonstrated a moderate to high rating in the GRADE assessment. Topical anesthetics, tramadol, and SSRIs significantly increase IELT. However, substantial heterogeneity among meta-analyses may limit the robustness of these findings. Future RCTs should include extended follow-up periods to better assess the long-term efficacy and safety of these treatments. CRD 42024561480.",

Current treatments primarily focus on physical therapy, medication, and surgery to alleviate symptoms associated with disc compression but do not address the progression of degeneration. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the potential of extracellular vesicle therapy as a novel preventive strategy to delay degeneration and enhance tissue repair in intervertebral discs. We cover the pathogenic mechanisms underlying intervertebral disc degeneration, including inflammation, apoptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, autophagy dysregulation, and the roles of non-coding RNAs. Subsequently, we discussed the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles and their molecular components, such as proteins, RNAs, and lipids, in modulating these pathways to counter intervertebral disc degeneration. We provides a comprehensive review of the significant role of extracellular vesicle cargo in mediating repair mechanisms. It discusses the functional enhancement advantages exhibited by extracellular vesicles under current bioengineering modifications and drug loading. The challenges and future prospects of utilizing extracellular vesicle therapy to treat this degenerative condition are also summarized.",

  "abstract": "Despite the extensive use of machine learning (ML) models in health sciences for outcome prediction and condition classification, their application in differentiating various types of auditory disorders remains limited. This study aimed to address this gap by evaluating the efficacy of five ML models in distinguishing (a) individuals with tinnitus from those without tinnitus and (b) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) from age-related hearing loss (ARHL). We used data from a cross-sectional study of the Canadian population, which included audiologic and demographic information from 928 adults aged 30 to 100 years, diagnosed with either ARHL or NIHL due to long-term occupational noise exposure. The ML models applied in this study were artificial neural networks (ANNs), K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machines. The study revealed that tinnitus prevalence was over twice as high in the NIHL group compared with the ARHL group, with a frequency of 27.85% versus 8.85% in constant tinnitus and 18.55% versus 10.86% in intermittent tinnitus. In pattern recognition, significantly greater hearing loss was found at medium- and high-band frequencies in NIHL versus ARHL. In both NIHL and ARHL, individuals with tinnitus showed better pure-tone sensitivity than those without tinnitus. Among the ML models, ANN achieved the highest overall accuracy (70%), precision (60%), and F1-score (87%) for predicting tinnitus, with an area under the curve of 0.71. RF outperformed other models in differentiating NIHL from ARHL, with the highest precision (79% for NIHL, 85% for ARHL), recall (85% for NIHL), F1-score (81% for NIHL), and area under the curve (0.90). Our findings highlight the application of ML models, particularly ANN and RF, in advancing diagnostic precision for tinnitus and NIHL, potentially providing a framework for integrating ML techniques into clinical audiology for improved diagnostic precision.

  "abstract": "Full-thickness, transtendinous supraspinatus tears involve a significant portion of the remnant tendon that remains attached to the greater tuberosity footprint. This tear type often leaves insufficient medial tissue for tension-free footprint restoration with traditional repair techniques. In these clinical scenarios, side-to-side suture repair is an effective repair technique. Indications for this procedure include an acute mechanism of injury, sufficient remnant tendon left on the greater tuberosity, and a medial tear location such that primary repair of the medial tendon would not result in overtensioning of the repair. Following diagnostic arthroscopy, 2 suture tapes are passed through the medial and lateral portion of the tendon surface in a simple side-to-side fashion. Two FiberLink sutures (Arthrex) are then placed in luggage tag fashion, in between the side-to-side sutures within the myotendinous portion of the tear. The suture tapes are then tied in an arthroscopic fashion, completing the side-to-side repair. The looped sutures are then secured through a 4.75-mm BioComposite SwiveLock lateral row anchor (Arthrex) as an added reinforcement to prevent medial retraction of the myotendinous portion of the tear, creating a tension-free environment for optimal tear healing. Available literature suggests that the side-to-side repair technique in patients with transtendinous supraspinatus rotator cuff tears yields excellent outcomes equivalent to that of tendon-to-bone double-row suture anchor repair for conventional tendon to bone type tears. This surgical technique reduces risk of overtensioning the repair and optimizes the healing environment in this rare clinical scenario. Side-to-side suture repair for full-thickness transtendinous supraspinatus tears is an effective treatment for patients with this uncommon presentation. When healthy tendon is present, a robust repair can be achieved with excellent outcomes and low rates of surgical complications.

  "abstract": "Early identification of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children is important to prevent chronic symptoms and long-term negative consequences. However, PTSD often goes unrecognized in the emergency setting of hospitals and screening methods for young children are lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of an early screening tool for PTSD in a sample of young children (0-7 years) after unintentional injury. The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale - Early Screener (PEDS-ES) was administered to parents of children referred to the Emergency Department within 7 days post-accident (  = 82), and a validated interview for PTSD was administered 3 months after the accident as criterion measure: the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA). Diagnostic accuracy of the PEDS-ES was inspected using area under the curve analyses including sensitivity, specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Value. After three months PTSD diagnosis was established in 21% of the children. Use of the PEDS-ES within 7 days after the injury showed fair accuracy with AUC = .727. Sensitivity (0.65) and specificity (0.73) for the suggested cutoff of 8 were moderate for predicting PTSD diagnosis 3 months after the injury. The examination of cutoff values that achieve enhanced sensitivity in a screening context - where sensitivity is prioritized - while maintaining a high level of specificity suggests that a lower cutoff of around 6 points may serve as a more sensitive (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.56) valid alternative cutoff score. The PEDS-ES allows for successful early screening of risk for traumatic stress symptoms in young children after single accidental injury. It enables early identification of individuals who are at risk for developing PTSD and need further monitoring of symptoms, diagnostic assessment and treatment. In young children at emergency settings of hospitals, development of PTSD often goes unrecognized, while consequences can be debilitating.The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale-Early Screener (PEDS-ES) for PTSD risk in young children after accidental injury shows fair predictive power.Young children at increased risk for PTSD can be identified early and offered secondary preventive interventions.",

We developed an innovative burn Polydopamine-Alginate-Zinc ion (Zn ) dressing (APBM) using a synergistic approach combining passive bacterial inhibition and active sterilization mechanisms. APBM was synthesized through a facile two-step process, integrating an effective bacterial adhesion-blocking mechanism with active sterilization via Zn . In vitro studies demonstrated that APBM achieved over 99 % antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and exhibited notable activity against Candida albicans (C. albicans). The antibacterial effect persisted for 11 days against S. aureus and 9 days against E. coli. APBM exhibited an exudate absorption rate twice that of conventional polyurethane (PU) sponges. In a rat burn model, APBM enhanced micro angiogenesis, collagen deposition and reduced inflammation, resulting in a 27.5 % faster wound healing rate compared to the blank group. This performance was superior to dressings employing only a single antimicrobial strategy and conventional sponges. Overall, APBM showed significant potential as a composite functional dressing addressing infection prevention, exudate management, and healing promotion, presenting a promising solution to the major challenges faced in burn wound care.",

  "abstract": "Inflammation is a principal cause of sensorineural hearing loss resulting from cochlear injury. However, current research investigating the mechanisms of sensorineural inflammatory injury remains inadequate. Cochlear inflammation was induced by administering lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the otic bulla (OB) and posterior semicircular canal (PSCC). Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded, and cochlear tissue alterations were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunofluorescence. Levels of cochlear inflammation were quantified using a cytokine array. Additionally, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) knockout mice were employed to evaluate sensorineural neuroprotection. LPS injection into the PSCC caused more pronounced and stable cochlear inflammatory damage compared to injection into the OB. LPS exposure led to significant loss of cochlear hair cells, atrophy of the stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion damage. Furthermore, LPS treatment upregulated TLR4 receptor expression, increased the number of Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) positive cells, and elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the cochlea. TLR4 knockout (TLR4-KO) mice demonstrated reduced LPS-induced cochlear sensorineural damage. LPS injection into the PSCC induces sensorineural tissue damage in the cochlea and results in sensorineural hearing loss. These findings suggest that TLR4 inhibition can alleviate cochlear inflammation-induced sensorineural hearing loss. TLR4 represents a potential therapeutic target for sensorineural hearing loss.",

  "abstract": "Bone metastases and pathological fractures significantly impact the prognosis and quality of life in cancer patients. However, clinical and radiological features alone have been shown to fail to predict skeletal related events of a bone metastasis (SREs). This study focuses on key molecular players including Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs), Integrins, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Parathormone-related Protein (PTHrP). The RANK/RANKL/Osteoprotegerin (OPG) pathway, and N-terminal peptide (NTx), involved in the metastatic process and bone integrity disruption. Elevated levels of these molecules have been pointed out as potential biomarkers for predicting SREs, but they have been poorly investigated. Moreover, batimastat, marimastat, tanomastat, andecaliximab, and HIV protease targeting MMPs; Volociximab/M200, cilengitide, abituzumab, and FAK inhibitors targeting integrins; LDN193189, DMH1, and ISLR modulators targeting BMPs; and PTH (7-33)-CBD targeting PTHrP have shown promising results antagonizing these molecules, but no effect on preventing and managing metastatic fractures has been assessed yet. This paper underscores the importance of advanced molecular biology and transcriptomics in identifying novel therapeutic targets. The integration of these biomarkers with clinical and radiological assessments using artificial intelligence tools could revolutionize the diagnostics and treatment strategies for patients with bone metastases.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to explore the feasibility and accuracy of deep learning-based pediatric behavioral audiometry. The research provides a dedicated pediatric posture detection dataset, which contains a large number of video clips from children's behavioral hearing tests, encompassing various typical hearing test actions. A detection platform based on this dataset is also constructed, named intelligent diagnostic model of pediatric hearing based on optimized transformer (DoT); further, an estimation model of patient skeletal keypoints based on optimized transformer (POTR) was proposed to estimate human skeleton points. Based on this, the DoT approach was handled to perform posture recognition on videos of children undergoing behavioral hearing tests, thus enabling an automated hearing testing process. Through this platform, children's movements can be monitored and analyzed in real-time, allowing for the assessment of their hearing levels. Moreover, the study establishes decision rules based on specific actions, combining professional knowledge and experience in audiology to evaluate children's hearing levels based on their movement status. Firstly, we gathered image and video data related to posture in the process of conditioned play audiometry to test the hearing of 120 children aged 2.5 to 6 years old. Next, we built and optimized a deep learning model suitable for pediatric posture recognition. Finally, in the deployment and application phase, we deployed the trained pediatric posture recognition model into real-world application environments. We found that for children aged 2.5 - 4 years, the sensitivity of artificial behavior audiometry (0.900) was not as high as that of AI behavior audiometry (0.929), but the specificity of artificial behavior audiometry (0.824) and Area Under Curve (AUC) (0.901) was higher than that of AI behavior audiometry. For children aged 4-6 years, the sensitivity (0.943), specificity (0.947), and AUC (0.924) of artificial behavioral audiometry were higher than those of AI behavioral audiometry. The application of these rules facilitates objective assessment and diagnosis of children's hearing, providing essential foundations for early screening and treatment of children with hearing disorders.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: Registration number ChiCTR2100050416.",

  "abstract": "Adherence to hydroxyurea has been low historically. The InCharge Health app demonstrates increased adherence with hydroxyurea, but engagement has not been fully investigated. This study investigated the association between InCharge Health app perceptions and app engagement among adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). We obtained user perceptions of InCharge with the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) among participants of the \"Integration of mHealth into Sickle Cell Disease Care to Increase Hydroxyurea Utilization\" study. Days of app use were correlated with reported patient-reported outcomes of interest, ease of use, the utility of features, and importance of features. Of 293 enrolled participants, 284 remained active in the study, and 206 (72.5%) completed the 24-week MARS survey. App Interest was positively correlated with app use (p = 0.01) and self-reported days of app use (p = 0.0008). Perceived ease of use trended toward significance with greater app use (p = 0.06). Most individuals (72.0%, 144/200) agreed the app helped them remember to take hydroxyurea, with trends toward higher days of app use (p = 0.07). Those who used the app more agreed they would continue to use it after the study (p = 0.04). Most individuals (54.3%) reported that reminders to take their hydroxyurea were the most important app feature. In this study, positive perceptions toward the application features influenced app use and intention to continue using the application. Determining features that drive application utilization can have a positive impact when an app, such as the InCharge app, is demonstrated to improve adherence with proven therapy.",

  "abstract": "This study compared three methods of acoustic algorithm-supported extraction and analysis of vocal tremor properties (i.e., rate, extent, and regularity of intensity level and fundamental frequency modulation): (a) visual perception and manual data extraction, (b) semi-automated data extraction, and (c) fully automated data extraction. Forty-five midvowel sustained [a:] and [i:] audio recordings were collected as part of a scientific project to learn about the physiologic substrates of vocal tremor. This convenience data set contained vowels with a representative variety in vocal tremor severity. First, the vocal tremor properties in intensity level and fundamental frequency tracks were visually inspected and manually measured using Praat software. Second, the vocal tremor properties were determined using two Praat scripts: automated with the script of Maryn et al. (2019) and semi-automated with an adjusted version of this script to enable the user to intervene with the signal processing. The reliability of manual vocal tremor property measurement was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. The properties as measured with the two scripts (automated vs. semi-automated) were compared with the manually determined properties using correlation and diagnostic accuracy statistical methods. With intraclass correlation coefficients between .770 and .914, the reliability of the manual method was acceptable. The semi-automated method correlated with manual property measures better and was more accurate in diagnosing vocal tremor than the automated method. Manual acoustic measurement of vocal tremor properties can be laborious and time-consuming. Automated or semi-automated acoustic methods may improve efficiency in vocal tremor property measurement in clinical as well as research settings. Although both Praat script-supported methods in this study yielded acceptable validity with the manual data measurements as a referent, the semi-automated method showed the best outcomes. https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.28873088.",

  "abstract": "Drug and chemical nephrotoxicity is a common cause of kidney disorders. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the recent progress in applying nanocurcumins (nano-CURs) to prevent and mitigate drug and chemical-induced nephrotoxicity, highlighting their underlying protective mechanisms and therapeutic potential. A comprehensive search of experimental and clinical studies was conducted in various databases, including Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. The studies were analyzed for improvements in bioavailability, mechanisms of action, and outcomes in reducing kidney damage. After extracting the data and entering it into an Excel sheet, the essential information and the related knowledge on consequences and mechanisms were collected. The collected information was discussed and analyzed. The antioxidant property of nano-CURs in dealing with nephrotoxicity is one of their most critical nephroprotective properties. They also exhibit potent anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and anti-pyroptotic effects. Moreover, nano-CURs improve mitochondrial function, modulate kidney biochemical markers, modulate electrolyte imbalance, reduce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and improve kidney histopathological changes and autophagy, offering protection against nephrotoxicity induced by various drugs and chemicals. Nano-CURs significantly improve histopathological changes. Animal models have demonstrated reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, causing improved renal function and histological outcomes. Nano-CURs have shown promising nephroprotective effects in experimental studies. However, these results have not been significant in clinical trial studies. Future research should focus on clinical trials and optimizing formulations for broader therapeutic applications.",

We retrospectively recruited 56 EPE, 50 LPE patients and 92 normotensive controls from three tertiary hospitals and used clinical and laboratory data in early pregnancy. Models for EPE and LPE were fitted with the use of patient' clinical, multi-omics and laboratory data. By comparing multi-omics and laboratory test variables between EPE, LPE and healthy controls, we identified sets of differentially expressed biomarkers, including 49 and 33 metabolites, 28 and 36 proteins as well as 5 and 7 laboratory variables associated with EPE and LPE respectively. Using the random forest algorithm, we developed a prediction model using seven clinical factors, seven metabolites, five laboratory test variables. The model yielded the highest accuracy for EPE prediction with good sensitivity (87.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 67.64%-97.34%) and specificity (94.1%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%). We also developed a prediction model that exhibited high accuracy in separating LPE from controls (sensitivity: 66.67%, 95% CI: 43.03%-85.41%; specificity: 94.12%, 95% CI: 80.32%-99.28%) using seven clinical factors, five metabolites and eight proteins. Our study has identified a set of significant omics and laboratory features for PE prediction.

  "abstract": "https://clinicaltrials.gov identifier is NCT04892173; EudraCT Number: 2021-002163-22. Locally advanced head and neck cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the head or neck region and has spread to nearby areas. Older patients with this cancer often have other health problems or may be frail, which can make it harder for them to tolerate the usual treatment of cisplatin (an anti-cancer drug) combined with radiation. This can make it difficult for some older patients to receive the standard treatment, so there is a need for other treatment options.NBTXR3 is a new type of treatment that helps improve how radiation therapy works. It is a special kind of nanoparticle that is injected into cancer cells. When radiation is given, these nanoparticles help the radiation kill more cancer cells and slow down cancer growth. Research suggests NBTXR3 also helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively and that NBTXR3 can make cancer treatment more effective, with better results for patients.NANORAY-312 is a study looking at how NBTXR3 works when used with radiation (and some patients may also receive cetuximab, a drug that helps the immune system fight cancer) in treating older patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. The study is testing whether this treatment can be a good alternative for those who cannot receive cisplatin. The study is ongoing, and its main goal is to see whether patients who receive NBTXR3 will live longer than those who will not receive the treatment.",

Patients with at least one comorbidity accounted for 35% of total patients with hypertension 6% (20), congenital heart disease 5% (n = 18), and seizure disorder 4% (n = 15) representing the most common comorbidities. Most common indications for liver transplant were biliary atresia (21%) and progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis (20%). The most common reasons for ED visits were gastrointestinal symptoms (32%), pulmonary symptoms (22%), and infectious symptoms (16%). Patients' average length of stay in the hospital was 4 ± 10.7 days. Visits within the first 6 months accounted for 58% of total visits in the first year with first and second visits accounting for 47% of total emergency department visits. The study highlights the high frequency of emergency department visits in pediatric subgroup as well the first 6 months as a critical period for follow-up.

We recruited CRSwNP patients who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery and classified them into three groups based on BMI: normal weight, overweight, and obesity. All patients were followed for 3 years and divided into recurrence and nonrecurrence groups. The histopathological features and the impact of BMI on the risk of postoperative recurrence were analyzed through comparative analysis. A total of 577 CRSwNP patients completed the follow-up, with 197 experiencing postoperative recurrence. Recurrence rates, tissue eosinophil counts, and interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-17A expression levels were significantly higher in the overweight and obesity groups compared to the normal weight group. Additionally, within the overweight and obesity groups, patients with recurrence had elevated tissue eosinophil counts and IL-5 and IL-17A levels compared to the other two groups. Notably, tissues collected during revision surgery showed increased eosinophil counts, IL-5 and IL-17A levels compared to baseline, particularly in obese patients. Both logistic regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that overweight and obesity were associated with an increased risk of CRSwNP recurrence. Elevated BMI presented significant impacts on the histopathological changes and the risk of postoperative recurrence in CRSwNP patients. Overweight and obesity aggravated tissue eosinophil infiltration, and IL-5 and IL-17A expressions contributing to the recurrent mechanisms of CRSwNP.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort-study of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases from the first to third wave (March 2020-October 2021) in Yaounde-Cameroon. RT-PCR was carried out on the participants using nasopharyngeal swabs after every 7 days. SARS-CoV-2 positivity duration was evaluated from the first to last positive PCR-test before a negative result. Epi-info V.7.0 was used for data analyses with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. A total of 282 participants were enrolled. The mean age was 41 ± 14 years, with male predominant (62.1%). We had 15.6% symptomatic participants of which 59% had cough. The overall median positivity duration was 15[IQR: 9-23] days with 15[IQR: 13-22] in the first, 17[IQR: 12-26] in the second and 9[IQR: 6-12] in the third wave (p < 0.0001). Positivity duration was significantly higher in males (16 versus 14 days, p = 0.03) those aged [35-45] years (16 days) followed by those ≥ 46 years(15 days); p = 0.008). Positivity duration was not affected by presence or absence of symptoms (p = 0.80). No significant correlation was found with viral load (r = 0.03; p = 0.61).

  "abstract": "to compare the effect of using a pre-reacted glass-ionomer (PRG) barrier coat versus silver diamine fluoride (SDF) varnish treatment before orthodontic bracket bonding to prevent white spot lesions (WSL). The effect of these materials on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets was evaluated through an in vitro study. One hundred-five premolars were used; forty-two specimens were designated for comparing SDF versus PRG-barrier coat using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with elemental analysis and microhardness testing (n = 21/group). Tested materials were applied in a split-tooth design protocol (side A: control, side B: treated). Measurement was made at baseline and after bracket placement and exposure to the pH cycle. A polarized light microscope (PLM) was used for qualitative examination. Sixty-three specimens were intended for shear bond strength (SBS) testing after the pH cycle as follows: control group (no treatment), SDF group, and PRG-barrier coat group (n = 21/group). Statistical analysis was done using Paired T-test. SEM for specimens treated by SDF or PRG revealed enamel remineralization with calcium deposits and small porosities between the crystallites. All groups had a significant difference regarding the Ca/P ratio and microhardness. Baseline hardness for both groups was significantly higher than the treated sides, which was significantly higher than the non-treated sides (P = 0.000*) and (P = 0.000*) in accordance with the Paired T-test. In comparing SDF with PRG-coat groups, the T-test showed non-significant differences in mean differences between treated and baseline hardness values (T = 0.32, P = 0.74). PLM for treated specimens by SDF or PRG depicted an evident remineralized surface enamel layer. SBS values did not differ significantly between groups. As confirmed by SEM and PLM, applying either SDF varnish or PRG-barrier coat before bonding orthodontic brackets could effectively prevent the development of WSL and achieve surface enamel protection. In addition, the two applied varnishes showed slightly higher shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets compared to the control group, with the SDF slightly higher than PRG. Also, clinical translation is needed in future research to evaluate the study.",

This study evaluated the remineralization efficiency of three commercial treatments on artificially demineralized primary enamel. Forty exfoliated primary anterior teeth were demineralized and divided into five groups: untreated control, artificial saliva, fluoridated toothpaste, Curasept toothpaste, and BioMin toothpaste. The treatments were applied for 28 days. Remineralization efficacy was assessed using Vickers microhardness testing, surface roughness measurement, and Scanning electron microscope combined with EDX (SEM-EDX). One-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test were used for statistical analysis. Microhardness and surface roughness tests confirmed BioMin's superior remineralization potential. Scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated enamel exhibited extensive demineralization, whereas treated groups displayed varying degrees of remineralization. BioMin demonstrated the highest calcium, phosphate, and fluoride incorporation, followed by Curasept and fluoridated toothpaste. The artificial saliva group showed no significant improvement over the control. BioMin, followed by Curasept and fluoridated toothpaste, effectively remineralized demineralized enamel. BioMin's bioactive glass formulation provided the highest mineral gain, suggesting its potential for non-invasive enamel restoration in pediatric dentistry.",

The author reports a case of a nulliparous woman in her mid-30s with a history of TSC and prior radical nephrectomy for renal angiomyolipoma. She presented with a history of heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhoea and lower abdominal pain. Imaging studies were suggestive of a large ruptured haemorrhagic ovarian cyst with the presence of blood in the uterine cavity. Laparoscopy-guided biopsy was performed by a gastrointestinal surgeon due to extensive adhesions. Intraoperative findings included a friable mass adherent to the pouch of Douglas and dense ovarian adhesions. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was put on hormonal therapy. This case highlights the complex interplay of TSC-related pathology with gynaecological emergencies, emphasising the role of multidisciplinary management.",

  "abstract": "The preservation of the pelvic autonomic nervous system in total mesorectal excision remains challenging to date. The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study. The artificial intelligence model for real-time visual neurorecognition in total mesorectal excision was successfully established for the first time in China. Better identification of these autonomic nerves should allow for better preservation of urogenital function, but further research is needed to validate this claim. See Video Abstract . ANTECEDENTES:La preservación del sistema nervioso autónomo pélvico en la escisión mesorrectal total sigue siendo un desafío hasta la fecha. La aplicación de la laparoscopia ha permitido la visualización de estructuras anatómicas finas; sin embargo, la tasa de disfunción urogenital sigue siendo alta.OBJETIVO:Establecer un sistema de reconocimiento neurológico con inteligencia artificial para realizar el reconocimiento neurológico durante la escisión mesorrectal total.DISEÑO Y ESCENARIO:Este estudio retrospectivo se realizó en un solo hospital.PACIENTES:Se recopilaron retrospectivamente imágenes intraoperatorias o capturas de pantalla de video de pacientes con cáncer de recto ingresados en el Departamento de Cirugía Gastrointestinal, del Hospital Memorial Sun Yat-sen, de la Universidad Sun Yat-sen, entre enero de 2016 y diciembre de 2023.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACIÓN:Intersección media sobre unión, precisión, recuperación y F1 del modelo.RESULTADOS:Se incluyeron un total de 1424 imágenes intraoperatorias de alta calidad en el grupo de entrenamiento. El modelo propuesto se obtuvo después de 700 interaciones. La intersección media sobre la unión fue de 0,75 y aumentó lentamente con el aumento del tiempo de entrenamiento. La precisión y la recuperación de la categoría de nervio fueron de 0,7494 y 0,6587, respectivamente, y el F1 fue de 0,7011. A partir de la predicción del video, podemos observar que el modelo logra una alta tasa de precisión, lo que podría facilitar el neurorreconocimiento efectivo.LIMITACIÓN:Este fue un estudio de un solo centro.CONCLUSIÓN:El modelo de inteligencia artificial para el neurorreconocimiento visual en tiempo real en la escisión mesorrectal total se estableció con éxito por primera vez en China. Una mejor identificación de estos nervios autónomos debería permitir una mejor preservación de la función urogenital, pero se necesita más investigación para validar esta afirmación.

  "abstract": "Objective Presently, societal guidelines differ regarding evaluation and management of variations in placental cord insertion (PCI). This variation may in part be secondary to inconsistency in reported risk associated with marginal and velamentous cord insertion (VCI). The objective of this study is to compare perinatal outcomes based on placental cord insertion (PCI) site in pregnancies at risks for fetal growth disorders. Study design This was a secondary analysis of singletons with growth assessment between 26 and 36 weeks of gestation. Fetuses with chromosomal or congenital malformations were excluded. The primary outcomes studied were neonatal small for gestational age (SGA), birthweight, and gestational age (GA) at delivery. Other outcomes included a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes, a composite score of obstetrical outcomes, and hypoglycemia. Categorical data was analyzed with X2 and continuous data with Kruskal Wallis tests. Pairwise comparisons and Bonferroni corrections were utilized. Logistic regression model was applied to assess the association of hypoglycemia with velamentous cord insertion. Results Of the 1054 fetuses, 660 had confirmed PCI site by pathology review. Of those, 609 (92%) had central cord insertion, 37 (5.6%) had marginal, and 14 (2.1%) had velamentous. There was no difference in SGA or preterm birth. Those with a VCI had lower GA at delivery than placentas with central cord insertion (37.6 vs. 38.6, p=0.032) and higher rates of hypoglycemia than those with other types of PCIs, 26.2% for central cord insertion, 20% for marginal, and 71.4% for VCI (p<0.001). After controlling for confounders, VCI remained significantly associated with hypoglycemia (adjusted odds ratio = 5.52 95% CI 1.54-19.82). Conclusions Velamentous cord insertion was associated with lower GA at delivery and higher rates of neonatal hypoglycemia compared to other PCIs. Additional studies are needed to assess the association of marginal and velamentous cord insertion and adverse perinatal outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Desmoplastic reaction is recognized as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

  "abstract": "Early identification of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children is important to prevent chronic symptoms and long-term negative consequences. However, PTSD often goes unrecognized in the emergency setting of hospitals and screening methods for young children are lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of an early screening tool for PTSD in a sample of young children (0-7 years) after unintentional injury. The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale - Early Screener (PEDS-ES) was administered to parents of children referred to the Emergency Department within 7 days post-accident (  = 82), and a validated interview for PTSD was administered 3 months after the accident as criterion measure: the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA). Diagnostic accuracy of the PEDS-ES was inspected using area under the curve analyses including sensitivity, specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Value. After three months PTSD diagnosis was established in 21% of the children. Use of the PEDS-ES within 7 days after the injury showed fair accuracy with AUC = .727. Sensitivity (0.65) and specificity (0.73) for the suggested cutoff of 8 were moderate for predicting PTSD diagnosis 3 months after the injury. The examination of cutoff values that achieve enhanced sensitivity in a screening context - where sensitivity is prioritized - while maintaining a high level of specificity suggests that a lower cutoff of around 6 points may serve as a more sensitive (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.56) valid alternative cutoff score. The PEDS-ES allows for successful early screening of risk for traumatic stress symptoms in young children after single accidental injury. It enables early identification of individuals who are at risk for developing PTSD and need further monitoring of symptoms, diagnostic assessment and treatment. In young children at emergency settings of hospitals, development of PTSD often goes unrecognized, while consequences can be debilitating.The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale-Early Screener (PEDS-ES) for PTSD risk in young children after accidental injury shows fair predictive power.Young children at increased risk for PTSD can be identified early and offered secondary preventive interventions.",

  "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction (SD) and depression are prevalent issues that significantly affect both physical and mental health. This study aimed to explore the association between sexual function (SF) and depression in reproductive-aged population and further examine the mediating role of knowledge regarding the effect of sexual dysfunction on fertility (KSDF). This study enrolled a total of 10 761 participants aged 20-40 from 31 regions, including 5259 males and 5502 females, with a median age of 29.0 years. Basic demographic data were collected initially, followed by clinical data acquisition. The International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF5), the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT), the Female Sexual Function Index-19 (FSFI-19), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Disease Knowledge Questionnaire. The study revealed a significant bidirectional association between SF and depression among the population. Specifically, poorer SF was correlated with higher severity of depressive (IIEF5 [β = -0.155, P < .001], PEDT [β = 0.311, P < .001], and FSFI-19 [β = -0.059, P < .001]). Conversely, higher severity of depressive was associated with poorer SF (IIEF5 [β = -0.202, P < .001], PEDT [β = 0.249, P < .001], and FSFI-19 [β = -0.191, P < 0.001]). Furthermore, in males, the KSDF mediated the bidirectional associations between SF and depression. Specifically, the mediating proportions were as follows: KSDF mediated 3.00% of the association between IIEF5 and depression, and 2.20% of the association between PEDT and depression; similarly, for the association between depression and SF, KSDF mediated 2.50% of the association between depression and IIEF5 and 2.20% between depression and PEDT. However, no such mediation was observed in females. This provides new insights for the clinical management of these issues in the male reproductive-aged population. These findings suggest that enhancing this knowledge could interrupt bidirectional association between impaired SF and depression in this demographic, potentially alleviating both conditions without requiring additional interventions. However, cross-sectional study design does not allow us to draw corresponding causal conclusions. The current study further demonstrated a significant bidirectional association between SF and depression among the reproductive-aged population, and importantly, the KSDF was found to mediate this association in males.",

  "abstract": "After neoadjuvant therapy, pathologic analysis of rectal cancer resected specimens may show a complete response in the primary tissue cancer with residual tumor in the lymph nodes (ypT0N+). The aim of this study was to describe the 5-year overall survival and factors associated with survival of ypT0N+ patients with rectal cancer who had neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and to compare these patients' survival with patients in other pathologic categories. We conducted a retrospective analysis. We used the National Cancer Database. We identified patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total neoadjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery between 2006 and 2016. Besides ypT0N+, 5 pathologic categories were identified: ypT0N0, ypT1-2N0, ypT3-4N0, ypT1-2N+, and ypT3-4N+. The primary outcome measure was 5-year overall survival. We included 30,751 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A total of 342 patients developed ypT0N+, of whom 181 (52.9%) received total neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients who received total neoadjuvant therapy, developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, ypT0N+ disease was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between ypT0N+ and ypT3-4N0 or ypT1-2N+. Similar findings were noticed among patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ypT0N+, older age, male gender, and higher number of positive lymph nodes were all associated with a decrease in the overall survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study, lack of variables describing the chemotherapy and radiation regimens used, and paucity of data on disease-specific survival or recurrence. Developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, it was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+.

Primary outcomes were changes in pure tone average (PTA) of affected and contralateral ears. Patients who failed a newborn hearing screen (NBHS) were considered 'congenital' onset, those who passed \"postnatal,\" and those without \"unknown.\" Demographics, infectious/genetic workup, audiograms, imaging, and hearing aid use were collected. A total of 1264 charts reviewed, 476 subjects included: 156 congenital, 252 postnatal, and 68 unknown onset. The mean (SD) of the first PTA was 53.8(29.4) dB for affected and 10.6(5.8) dB for unaffected ears. Thirty-nine percent followed up > 5 years. Change in PTA over time was 3.0(14.5) dB for affected and -1.7(7.4) dB for unaffected ears. The congenital subgroup had poorer hearing in the affected ear at the first audiogram (p < 0.0001) and was more likely to have progressive hearing loss (p = 0.0040) than the postnatal subgroup. Imaging in 296 patients revealed ipsilateral abnormalities in 26.6% of CTs and 39.6% of MRIs. Absent/hypoplastic cochlear nerve was the most common abnormal and was associated with poorer hearing than those with normal nerves (p < 0.0001). Enlarged vestibular aqueduct was not associated with progression of hearing loss. Hearing in both the affected and contralateral ears remained stable after the first audiogram in > 80% of patients. Patients with congenital loss had poorer hearing at diagnosis and were more likely to have progression than those with postnatal loss. MRI was more sensitive than CT in detecting an anatomic cause of SNHL, and absent/hypoplastic cochlear nerve was the most common finding.",

  "abstract": "We analyzed blood serum samples from two unique female occupational cohorts - 60 nurses and 40 office workers in San Francisco, CA - using liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (quadrupole time-of-flight). Applying a nontargeted analysis (NTA) approach, we sought to isolate occupationally related chemical exposures that were unique to nurses by flagging features that were different from office workers in abundance (mean; 95th percentile) or detection frequency. Of 9828 negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) and 6898 positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) detected chemical features, 1094 and 938, respectively, were higher in nurses, possibly due to workplace exposures. We deciphered the molecular structures of these chemical features by applying data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and targeted MS/MS approaches to pooled samples from each occupational group, and we annotated them using spectral MS/MS databases in MS-DIAL. Nurses had higher concentrations of 14 chemicals that we identified at Schymanski Level 1 (N = 6) or 2 (N = 8), as well as 20 tentatively identified chemicals without spectra. Several chemicals may be occupationally relevant for nurses, including a PFAS (6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid), tridecanedioic acid, salicylic acid, and the medications acetaminophen and theophylline. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply NTA to elucidate novel chemical exposures in nurses.",

  "abstract": "Systemic inflammation contributes to the progression of malignancies. The preoperative lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio has recently been shown to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery, but its prognostic value remains unclear in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. This study aimed to examine the prognostic values of inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, focusing on the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. This is a retrospective study from a prospectively collected database. This study was conducted at a high-volume multidisciplinary tertiary cancer center in Japan. The subjects were 756 consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who received systemic chemotherapy from 2000 to 2015. The prognostic value of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was evaluated by univariable and multivariable analyses. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to compare the prognostic impact of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio with the impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, or the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score. The primary outcomes measured were the correlations of prognostic scores with overall survival. Median survival times of patients with high, intermediate, and low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratios were 29.4, 19.3, and 13.1 months (p < 0.001). In all subgroups according to key prognostic factors (performance status, use of targeted agents, pretreatment CEA levels, tumor sidedness, M category, and primary tumor resection), patient prognosis could be clearly stratified into 3 groups by the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was independently associated with reduced survival (low vs high: HR 1.96, p < 0.001; intermediate vs high: HR 1.44, p < 0.001). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was the most sensitive predictor of survival among all inflammation-based prognostic scores on a continuous basis. This study was retrospective in nature. The lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio is a useful prognostic biomarker for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer and could contribute to accurate prognostication and therapeutic decision making.

Se realizó análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo para comparar el impacto pronóstico de la proteína linfocito-C-reactiva con el de la proporción de neutrófilos a linfocitos, la proporción de plaquetas a linfocitos, la proporción de linfocitos a monocitos o la proporción de puntuación pronóstica segun escala de Glasgow modificada.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Correlacion de las puntuaciones pronósticas con la supervivencia global.RESULTADOS:La mediana de supervivencia de los pacientes con niveles altos, intermedios y bajos de proteína C reactiva de linfocitos fue de 29,4, 19,3 y 13,1 meses, respectivamente (p <0,001). En todos los subgrupos de acuerdo con los factores pronósticos clave (estado funcional, uso de agentes dirigidos, niveles de antígeno carcinoembrionario antes del tratamiento, lado del tumor, categoría M y resección del tumor primario), el pronóstico del paciente podría estratificarse claramente en tres grupos por linfocito a C- proteína reactiva. El análisis multivariable reveló que la disminución de linfocitos a proteína C reactiva se asoció de forma independiente con una supervivencia reducida (baja frente a alta: cociente de riesgo 1,96, p <0,001; intermedio frente a alto: cociente de riesgo 1,44, p <0,001). El análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo reveló que de linfocito a proteína C reactiva era el predictor de supervivencia más sensible entre todas las puntuaciones de pronóstico basadas en inflamación de forma continua.LIMITACIONES:Este estudio fue de naturaleza retrospectiva.CONCLUSIONES:La proteína C reactiva de linfocitos a C es un biomarcador pronóstico útil para el cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable y podría contribuir a un pronóstico preciso y a la toma de decisiones terapéuticas.

  "abstract": "To explore the clinical characteristics, therapeutic responses and prognostic features of   fusion gene for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L. The main immunophenotype was common-B ALL (44 cases, 91.7%). Other leukemia fusion genes such as   and   were not observed in this cohort of patients. All patients received the treatment of NPCLC-ALL2008 protocol, and 5 cases (10.4%) occurred poor prednisone response. All the 48 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction treatments. The last follow-up date was April 30, 2023. A total of 5 children relapsed, including 1 case with intermediate risk and 4 cases with high risk. The recurrence rate in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the intermediate- and low-risk groups (both   < 0.05). Most relapsed children had elevated WBC counts at initial diagnosis. Among them, WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was observed in 4 cases. The recurrence rate among children with WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was significantly higher than that with WBC counts <100×10 /L (  < 0.01). Four deaths occurred in this cohort, of which 3 died of leukemia recurrence. The 10-year event-free survival rate and 10-year overall survival rate of the 48 children with positive   fusion gene were 87.5%±4.8% and 91.7%±4.0%, respectively. In ALL children with positive   fusion gene, those with elevated WBC counts and high risk stratification at initial diagnosis are more likely to experience recurrence. Recurrence is the main cause of death in this group. It is suggested that such kind of children receive more intensive chemotherapy or undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as early as possible to further improve prognosis.  融合基因阳性儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病临床特点及预后分析. 探讨儿童   融合基因阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的临床特点、治疗反应及预后特征。. 回顾性分析2010年7月至2017年11月于本院初诊的ALL患儿837例，实时荧光定量PCR技术检测出   阳性患儿48例，收集其临床资料进行分析。. 48例   融合基因阳性患儿中男26例，女22例，发病年龄9个月-13岁。初诊低危、中危及高危分别为2例（4.2%）、32例（66.7%）和14例（29.1%）。初诊外周血白细胞数<50×10 /L者25例（53.2%），(50-100)×10 /L者11例（23.4%），≥100×10 /L者11例（23.4%）。免疫表型主要是以common-B ALL为主（44例，占91.7%）。48例   阳性患儿未检测到  等其他白血病融合基因。所有患儿均接受中国儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病2008方案治疗，其中，泼尼松反应不良者5例（10.4%）。48例患儿在诱导治疗结束后均获得完全缓解。至随访截止时间（2023年4月30日），共5例患儿出现复发，其中中危1例、高危4例，高危组患儿的复发率明显高于中、低危组（均  < 0.05）；绝大多数复发患儿初诊白细胞数较高，其中4例≥100×10 /L，初诊白细胞数≥100×10 /L组患儿的复发率明显高于<100×10 /L组（  < 0.01）。本组共有4例患儿死亡，其中因白血病复发导致死亡的患儿有3例。48例   融合基因阳性患儿10年无事件生存率及10年总生存率分别为87.5%±4.8%、91.7%±4.0%。. 在   融合基因阳性ALL患儿中，初诊白细胞计数高及危险度分层较高的患儿更容易出现复发，复发是患儿的主要死亡原因，建议此类患儿接受更高强度的化疗或尽早进行造血干细胞移植以进一步改善其预后。.",

  "abstract": "Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) can lead to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Identifying predictors of length of hospital stay (LOS) in PROM patients can aid in improving management and prognosis. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database was searched to acquire data on PROM individuals. A univariable analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariable generalized linear model (GLM) were adopted to identify factors closely related to LOS. Next, the change trends in the key variable over multiple time points were determined using a latent class trajectory model (LCTM). The association of these trajectories with LOS was analyzed using GLMs. The retrospective study finally enrolled 868 samples. The significant factors included initial hemoglobin, chorioamnionitis, premature birth, and rupture to delivery interval <24 h. Notably, higher initial hemoglobin level was independently associated with shorter LOS (β = -0.599; 95% CI = [-0.846, -0.352]; p < 0.05). The stratified analysis confirmed this association in all subgroups except those with chorioamnionitis. The LCTM identified three hemoglobin trajectories. Compared to other trajectory groups, the \"lowest, declining\" group had longer LOS (p < 0.05). PROM patients with lower initial hemoglobin levels and the \"lowest, declining\" trajectory group were linked to longer LOS. Monitoring and managing hemoglobin levels is important in improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

La supervivencia general disminuyó al aumentar el estadio del cáncer, pero no fue diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal. La razón de riesgo para la sobrevida libre de recurrencia por aumento de cm2 en el área de la superficie grasa perirrenal fue de 1.00 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0.99-1.01) ajustada por edad, sexo, categoría de la Sociedad Americana de Anestesiólogos, ubicación del tumor y complicación postoperatoria según Clavien-Dindo ≥ 2) La incidencia acumulada de recurrencia con muerte como un riesgo competitivo no fue estadísticamente diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal (p = 0.06). Los análisis de subgrupos mostraron una tendencia no significativa para que los hombres con un área de superficie menor en grasa perirrenal tengan un menor riesgo de recurrencia y las mujeres un mayor riesgo.LIMITACIONES:En todos los estudios basados en registros puede haber errores distribuidos aleatoriamente. Los resultados solo pueden generalizarse a resecciones de colon. Nuestra cohorte osciló durante un gran lapso de años.CONCLUSIONES:No se encontró asociación entre el área de superficie de la grasa perirrenal y la sobrevida general, ni con la sobrevida libre de recurrencia o la incidencia acumulada de recurrencia específica de la causa en pacientes sometidos a resección de colon por cáncer.

  "abstract": "BackgroundThe lack of adequate resources in international cooperation limits the study of surgical specimens. The literature on inexpensive and widely available fixation media is scarce.Materials and MethodsSpecimens were prospectively collected during a surgical cooperation campaign in Senegal, where a team from Spain provided surgical care to the local population. The lesions were fixed in parallel using 10% formalin and 70% ethyl alcohol. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical techniques (IHC) were performed. Histological images were independently evaluated by two senior and two junior pathologists through an anonymized questionnaire.ResultsThree surgical specimens were included: 1 lymphoid hyperplasia (3 H&E, 4 IHC), 1 seborrheic keratosis (2 H&E, 5 IHC), and 1 branchial remnant (2 H&E, 2 IHC). Fixation times were similar in all the specimens (10-13 days). All formalin H&E were diagnostic. Ethyl alcohol H&E was 100% diagnostic on 5/7 slides and 75% in the two remaining slides. In most slides, pathologists preferred formalin. Keratin 7, P40, EMA, keratin AE1/AE3, and TTF1 were 100% diagnostic in both groups. CD20, CD45, and EMA were 100% diagnostic in formalin and 75% diagnostic in ethyl alcohol. CD10 was 75% diagnostic in formalin and 25% diagnostic in ethyl alcohol. BCL6 was 75% diagnostic in formalin and 100% diagnostic in ethyl alcohol. IHC preferences were inconsistent.ConclusionsEthyl alcohol shows poorer fixation than formalin but enables diagnosis in most specimens. Immunoreactivity varies by tissue and stain. Further studies are needed to validate these results.",

  "abstract": "Mixed urinary incontinence, which includes both stress and urgency urinary incontinence, adversely affects quality of life and can be difficult to manage. Studies comparing procedural-based treatments for mixed urinary incontinence are lacking. To determine whether intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA is more effective than midurethral sling for the treatment of mixed urinary incontinence in females. Randomized, superiority trial involving females (aged ≥21 years) with moderate to severe bother from both stress and urgency urinary incontinence who had unsuccessful conservative treatments and oral medications. The study was conducted at 7 US sites with enrollment between July 2020 and September 2022; the last date of follow-up was December 29, 2023. Intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA, 100 U (treatment focused on the urgency component), vs surgical synthetic mesh midurethral sling (treatment focused on the stress component). Recipients of onabotulinumtoxinA could receive an additional injection between 3 and 6 months. All participants could receive additional treatment (including crossover to the alternative treatment) between 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome was change at 6 months in mixed incontinence symptoms as measured by the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) total score (0-300 points; higher scores indicate worse symptoms; minimal clinically important difference, 26.1). Secondary outcomes included stress and irritative UDI subscores. Among 150 females randomized, 137 were treated, had postbaseline outcome data, and were included in the primary analysis (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [11.5] years). Both groups demonstrated mean improvement in UDI total score at 6 months with no significant difference between groups (onabotulinumtoxinA: -66.8 points [95% CI, -84.9 to -48.8]; sling: -84.9 [95% CI, -100.5 to -69.3]; mean difference, 18.1 points [95% CI, -4.6 to 40.7]; P = .12). For secondary outcomes, greater UDI stress score improvement was seen with the sling (-45.2 [95% CI, -53.7 to -36.8]) compared with onabotulinumtoxinA (-25.1 [95% CI, -34.1 to -16.1]) (P < .001); however, no significant difference was seen between groups in UDI irritative score (onabotulinumtoxinA: -32.9 [95% CI, -40.3 to -25.6] vs sling: -27.4 [95% CI, -34.6 to -20.3]; P = .27). In the onabotulinumtoxinA group, 12.7% and 28.2% received a second injection by 6 and 12 months, respectively. By 12 months, 30.3% in the sling group received onabotulinumtoxinA, and 15.5% in the onabotulinumtoxinA group received a sling. Overall, adverse events were not different between groups. There was no observed difference in UDI total score improvement at 6 months between the onabotulinumtoxinA and midurethral sling groups in females with moderate to severe mixed urinary incontinence who previously did not respond to conservative treatments. These findings may help inform treatment decisions based on patient preference in partnership with clinician recommendations. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04171531.",

  "abstract": "Health care costs and wait times for colorectal cancer treatment are increasing in Canada, but the association between the 2 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between wait times and health care costs and utilization. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study. This study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014 were sorted and ranked into quintiles based on the time from index contact for a colorectal cancer-related symptom to first treatment. The primary outcome is risk-adjusted health care costs, and the secondary outcomes include health care utilization and overall mortality. We included a total of 6936 patients. Total wait times ranged between 0 and 762 days. In comparison with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly increased costs (short: mean cost ratio 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32; moderate: mean cost ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; long: mean cost ratio 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.64; and very long: mean cost ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Compared with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly lower risk of mortality (short: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; moderate: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80; long: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; very long: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85). The median number of pretreatment radiological and endoscopic investigations and surgeon clinic visits increased over the study period across all wait time categories. This is a nonrandomized, retrospective cohort study with potentially limited generalizability. Patients with very short and short wait times are likely those diagnosed with life-threatening complications of colorectal cancer. Outside this window, patients with longer wait times experience increased health care costs and utilization with similar overall mortality. Improved care coordination and patient navigation may help contain the increasing wait times and associated increasing health care costs and utilization.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the accessibility of telehealth (TH) and forced a trial of incorporating remote care into routine CF care. The CF Learning Network (CFLN) organized for data sharing into a telehealth innovation lab (TH-iLab) to improve access to the interdisciplinary care team and co-produced shared agenda-setting. All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

Of the 649 twin pregnancies (1298 live fetuses) at enrollment, there were 436 (70.6%) DC and 182 (29.4%) MCDA pregnancies. In total, 1168 babies were liveborn to 618 mothers (808 DC and 360 MCDA twins) after excluding cases lost to follow-up and TOPs. Anomalies were identified in 4.1% of the fetuses (48/1168). Of the 48 fetuses with anomalies, 17 (35.4%) were identified in the first, 21 (43.8%) in the second, and 6 (12.5%) in the third trimester. Additional 4 (8.3%) were identified postnatally. Of the anomalies, 37 were in fetuses from DC twins (4.57%), and 11 (3.05%) in MCDA twins. We demonstrate the utility of detailed fetal scans in twin pregnancies in all three trimesters. First- and second-trimester diagnosis enables genetic counseling and testing, and informed parental decisions of pregnancy management. In addition to alerting the parents to the presence of fetal anomalies, third-trimester scans enhanced delivery planning and newborn care.",

  "abstract": "Early detection of postoperative recurrence is beneficial for patients with cancer; however, optimal surveillance remains an issue. To optimize the follow-up plan, the estimation of an individual patient's risk of recurrence is indispensable. This study aimed to establish a statistical model for predicting the risk of organ-specific recurrence after curative resection of colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral hospital. This study included 1720 patients with colon cancer treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical charts. The risk score was developed using a competing risk model in a derivation cohort (973 patients treated in 1997-2009) and then validated in a validation cohort (747 patients treated in 2010-2015). Patients who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon cancer were included. The prediction of the incidence of postoperative liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer was measured. The factors selected for the prediction model for liver metastasis included differentiation, T category, venous invasion, N category, and preoperative CEA level. The model for lung metastasis included sex, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, N category, preoperative CEA level, and malignant bowel obstruction. During external validation, the area under the curve at 60 months was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for liver metastasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.81) for lung metastasis. The generalizability of the model to different healthcare settings remains to be elucidated. We developed a prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence in the liver and lung after curative resection of colon cancer, which demonstrated good discrimination ability in the external validation cohort. Our model can aid clinicians and patients in customizing postoperative surveillance according to an individual patient's risk of organ-specific recurrence.

DESARROLLO Y VALIDACIÓN DE UN MODELO DE PREDICCIÓN PARA RECURRENCIAS ESPECÍFICAS DESPUÉS DE RESECCIÓN CURATIVA DE UN CÁNCER DE COLON: La detección temprana de una recidiva postoperatoria es beneficiosa para los pacientes afectados de cáncer. Sin embargo, la mejor vigilancia sigue siendo un problema. Para optimizar el plan de seguimiento, la estimación del riesgo individual de recurrencia de un paciente es indispensable. Establecer un modelo estadístico para predecir el riesgo de recurrencia en un organo específico luego de la resección curativa de un cáncer de colon. DISEÑO:: Estudio retrospectivo de cohortes en un hospital de referencia terciaria. Este estudio incluyó 1720 pacientes con cáncer de colon tratados en el Hospital de la Universidad de Tokio entre 1997 y 2015. Los datos se recuperaron retrospectivamente de las historias clinicas de los pacientes. La puntuación de riesgo fué desarrollada utilizando un modelo de riesgo competitivo en cohortes de derivación (973 pacientes tratados en 1997-2009) y luego se lo validó en cohortes de validación (747 pacientes tratados en 2010-2015). Todos aquellos casos que se sometieron a una resección curativa de cáncer de colon en estadio I-III RESULTADOS PRINCIPLES:: La predicción de la incidencia de metástasis hepáticas y pulmonares postoperatorias del cáncer de colon. Los factores seleccionados para el modelo de predicción de metástasis hepáticas incluyeron diferenciación tumoral, categoría T, invasión venosa, categoría N y nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio. El modelo de predicción de metástasis pulmonar incluyó el sexo del paciente, la invasión linfática, la invasión venosa, la categoría N, el nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio y la obstrucción intestinal maligna. Durante la validación externa, el área inferior de la curva a 60 meses fue de 0,78 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,71 a 0,84) para las metástasis hepáticas y de 0,72 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,64 a 0,81) para las metástasis pulmonares. La generalización del presente modelo a diferentes entornos de atención en salud aún no ha podido ser dilucidado. Desarrollamos un modelo de predicción para estimar el riesgo de recurrencia en el hígado y el pulmón después de resección curativa de cáncer de colon, éste modelo demostró una buena capacidad de discriminación en las cohortes de validación externa. El modelo puede ayudar a médicos y pacientes a personalizar la vigilancia postoperatoria de acuerdo con el riesgo individual de recurrencia específica en un órgano específico.

  "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that necessitates high-calorie, protein-rich diets, leading to nutritional deficiencies. Food insecurity (FI) poses a significant challenge for people with CF (pwCF), impacting their ability to maintain the necessary dietary intake. This study aims to explore FI and dietary patterns among pwCF in Turkey. A cross-sectional study involving 290 pwCF from the Marmara University Selim Çöremen Cystic Fibrosis Center was conducted between April 2023 and February 2024. The \"US Household Food Security Survey Module\" and the \"Your Current Life Situation\" survey were used to assess FI and socioeconomic status among the participants. Nutritional data, including BMI, FEV1 values, and dietary intake, were recorded. Among the participants, 52.7% were female, with a mean age of 13.3 ± 8.1 years. FI was detected in 46.8% of pwCF, with 18% facing very low food security. Higher income levels were associated with better food security (p = 0.008). Nutritional inadequacies were observed even among food-secure individuals, particularly in the consumption of legumes, nuts, and fish. BMI and BMI percentile values were significantly lower in the very low FS group compared to the high FS group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively). Ensuring adequate nutrition and calorie intake is crucial for pwCF. Our study highlights significant FI among pwCF in Turkey, with income levels influencing food security status. Nutritional inadequacies persist even among those classified as food secure. Based on these findings, targeted nutritional support will be provided to those in need to improve overall health and well-being.",

  "abstract": "Small infants for gestational age (SGA) and large infants for gestational age (LGA) have increased risk of complications during delivery and later in life. Prediction of the fetal weight is currently limited to biometric parameters obtained by ultrasound scans that can be imprecise. Biomarkers of fetal growth would be crucial for tailoring clinical management and optimizing outcomes for the mother and child. Seventy pregnant women participated in the current study, including 58, 7, and 5 giving birth to adequate for gestational age (AGA), SGA, and LGA infants, respectively. Maternal venous blood was drawn at gestational weeks 12-19, 21-27, and 28-34 and quantified for nearly 5000 proteins on the SomaLogic platform. We used machine learning algorithms with leave-one-out cross-validation to construct multiprotein models for prediction of birth weight groups. Random forest models using only 20 predefined proteins (selected by moderated   tests) were able to predict LGA with good discrimination (AUC > 0.8) at all three visits, while prediction of SGA was less successful. Protein differential abundance analysis revealed 148 proteins with higher abundance in LGA compared to AGA pregnancies, while only four proteins were differentially abundant between the SGA and AGA. The principal findings indicate that the maternal plasma proteome may hold potential biomarkers of LGA.",

  "abstract": "Biopsies are routinely obtained in the workup of large colorectal polyps before endoscopic resection. This study aimed to examine how reliable biopsies are in terms of reflecting the true histopathology of large colorectal polyps, in the clinical routine. This is a retrospective study. Data from patients undergoing polypectomy of large colorectal polyps at the endoscopy unit, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, between January 2014 and December 2016 were scrutinized. A total of 485 colorectal lesions were biopsied within 1 year before complete endoscopic removal. Biopsy-obtained specimens were compared with completely resected specimens in terms of concordance and discordance and if the final result was upgraded or downgraded. The primary outcome measured was the concordance between biopsy-obtained specimens and completely resected specimens. Median lesion size was 3 cm (range 1-11). In 189 cases (39%), biopsies did not provide a correct dysplastic grade compared with final pathology after complete resection. One hundred forty-three cases (29%) and 46 cases (9%) were upgraded and downgraded. The percentage of cases with discordant biopsy results was 40% in cases with 1 biopsy taken and 38% in cases where multiple biopsies had been sampled. Time from biopsy to complete resection did not influence the erroneous outcome of biopsies. Notably, the percentage of discordant biopsy results was 37% and 35% in lesions measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm. However, this percentage increased to 48% in colorectal lesions larger than 4 cm. This study was designed to reflect the clinical routine, the number of biopsies obtained and forceps technique were hence not standardized, which constitutes a limitation. This study demonstrates that cancer-negative forceps biopsies of large colorectal polyps, referred for endoscopic resection, are not reliable. Considering that endoscopic resection of lesions containing superficial cancer is plausible, the clinical value of forceps biopsies in lesions suitable for endoscopic resection is questionable.

El porcentaje de casos con resultados de biopsia discordantes fue del 40% en los casos con una sola biopsia tomada y del 38% en los casos en los que se tomaron múltiples biopsias. El tiempo desde la biopsia hasta la resección completa no influyó en el resultado erróneo de las biopsias. Notablemente, el porcentaje de resultados de biopsia discordantes fue de 37% y 35% en lesiones que midieron 1-2 cm y 2-4 cm, respectivamente. Sin embargo, este porcentaje aumentó a 48% en lesiones colorrectales mayores de 4 cm.

  "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death globally in children aged 0-5 years. Early access to pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in low-resource, pre-hospital settings may result in improved pediatric pneumonia outcomes. However, few data exist regarding their application in such settings. We performed an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to examine use of pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in pre-hospital environments of Malawi. Our model yielded an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for pre-hospital pulse-oximetry use of $35 (USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared to no pulse-oximetry use. One-way sensitivity analysis showed highest sensitivity to the parameter of downstream hospitalization cost. Given that inpatient management is the standard of care for hypoxemic pneumonia, when only pre-hospital costs were considered the result was an ICER of $9.9/DALY averted. Both values were considered cost-effective according to a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold set for 1x the average GDP per capita in Malawi ($588, 2018). When oxygen was analyzed in combination with pulse-oximetry, we found a baseline WTP threshold for pre-hospital oxygen of $71 per patient. For every 1% reduction in total pediatric pneumonia mortality consequent to pre-hospital oxygen use, we determined the recommended WTP allowance for oxygen would increase by approximately $4.53. We conclude that pulse-oximetry is likely cost-effective in low-resource, pre-hospital environments. We acknowledge the need for further research on the effectiveness of pre-hospital oxygen in reducing pediatric pneumonia mortality and suggest ranges of cost and efficacy for which oxygen is likely to be found cost-effective in tandem with pulse-oximetry.",

  "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a non-hormonal vaginal moisturizer in alleviating the clinical symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). This was an observational, single center, open label study in which the investigational product was applied to postmenopausal women (  = 36) with VVA symptoms three times per week for a period of 12 weeks. Patient's perception of vaginal discomfort, sexual function improvement assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), quality of life evaluated with the Cervantes-SF scale, and subject's satisfaction with the treatment were evaluated after 4 and 12 weeks of product use. In addition, vaginal health was evaluated with the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) score and the vaginal pH. A statistically significant decrease was observed in the severity of the most bothersome symptoms from moderate at baseline (mean 2.47 ± 0.55) to mild after 4 weeks (mean 1.33 ± 0.58) and 12 weeks (mean 1.32 ± 0.74,   < 0.0001). VHI scores significantly improved after 4 and 12 weeks compared to baseline (from 11.70 to 16.36 at 4 weeks and 17.34 at 12 weeks, both   < 0.0001). Vaginal pH decreased significantly from a mean pH of 6.27 ± 0.46 at baseline to 5.77 ± 0.59 at 4 weeks and 5.56 ± 0.60 at 12 weeks of treatment (  < 0.0001). Total FSFI scores significantly increased, indicating improvement of sexual function, after 4 and then after 12 weeks of product use (Baseline score 20.16 compared to 24.27 at 4 and 23.94 at 12 weeks, both   < 0.0001). Quality of life improved (decrease of total Cervantes-SF scores) after 12 weeks of product use as compared to baseline (Baseline 32.09 vs 26.45,   = 0.0004). At 12 weeks, a 97.5% reported overall satisfaction with the product and no adverse events related to the product were reported. Through limited size study, the proposed non-hormonal vaginal moisturizer demonstrated being effective and safe for the management of VVA symptoms in postmenopausal women, offering significant improvements in symptom severity, vaginal health, sexual function, and quality of life. There is a need for further research with a larger sample and comparison with other similar products.",

We studied 404 patients, divided into three groups: 75 with CD, 120 DHF and 212 cases with no hemorrhagic data although displaying Dengue with Thrombocytopenia (DwT). General symptoms were much less common among Dengue cases. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were more frequent among patients with DHF. Fluid leakage and hemorrhaging were observed in 75% and 46%, respectively, of the latter group. The history of prior infection was proportional. All patients presenting DHF showed thrombocytopenia, though only 3% showed hemoconcentration. The mean value for hematocrit was low (p=0.02) and the platelet count greater (p<0.001) among Dengue cases. Hemoglobin concentration showed no difference. The average time between disease onset and appearance of thrombocytopenia was similar in DHF cases (4.3+/- 1.6 days) and Dengue with Thrombocytopenia (4.3+/-1.6); even though, contrary to these, in the first group fluid leakage (3.7+/-1.8) and hemorrhaging (3.4+/-1.7) were previously identified. Our results confirm the presence of cases showing atypical disease course, without external hemorrhaging data but showing significant thrombocytopenia that may go unnoticed and worsen disease progression.",

Of 200 consecutively recruited children with a previously proven diagnosis of PBB 62 (12.2 years, female 48%) were interviewed after 7.7 (5.4-14.7) years about their previous and current symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs: spirometry, body plethysmography, nitrogen multi-breath washout, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide) were performed. Children with persistent symptoms were offered lung imaging. 11 (17.7%) patients suffered from chronic or recurring wet cough years after their first PBB episode. 15 (24.19%) had at least one abnormal spirometry parameter. FEV1 was abnormal in eight of 62 (12.9%), LCI 2.5% in seven of 56 (12.5%), FVC in 12 of 62 (19.35%) and FEV1/FVC in five of 62 (8.06%) cases. PFT did not differ between children with and without wet cough. Lung MRI/CT demonstrate in four of nine cases abnormalities of the bronchial walls, including one with incipient bronchiectasis. After PBB in early childhood, a significant proportion of children suffer from respiratory symptoms many years later, some have an objectively reduced lung function and structural changes of the bronchial wall despite adequate initial therapy. Wet cough alone seems not to be a sensitive clinical predictor. Due to the retrospective study design, we cannot proof any causal relationship. However, to detect late bronchopulmonary sequelae, continuous follow-up of these children should become mandatory.",

We evaluated whether baseline binocular CS predicts 30-month functional brain network organization in 172 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 76.4±4.8 years, 56.4% female, 11.6% non-white/Hispanic) that underwent functional MRI (fMRI) at rest and during a motor imagery (MI) task. We constructed separate distance regression models for each of the 8 subnetworks covering the entire brain, while controlling for the baseline brain networks, sex, and the number of volumes removed during motion scrubbing from head motion in the scanner. Worse baseline CS predicted lower community structure integrity at 30-months in the visual network (VN, β=0.0115; p<0.0001), dorsal attention network (DAN, β=0.0075; p=0.0089), and default mode network both at rest (β=0.0173; p<0.0001) and during the MI task (DMN, β=0.0103; p=0.0002). No other networks showed significant associations. The DAN did not have a relationship with CS at baseline but was significant at 30-months. Similar findings were observed in models that additionally controlled for baseline MoCA and change in MoCA score over 30 months. Poor CS may identify a subset of older adults at risk of future decrements in brain circuits important for vision, cognitive and mobility functions. Future studies should explore if improving CS increases functional brain health.",

The full analysis showed non-inferiority of the relaxed treatment, with a mean difference of -0.12 letters (95%-CI: -3.45 to infinity, H0; mean. diff. ≤ 5 letters: p = 0.008), and a visual acuity gain of 7.3 (4.82; 9.78) vs. 7.01 (3.67; 10.36) letters in the strict vs. relaxed regimen, respectively. Many patients deviated from the protocol due to Covid-19. Per-protocol analysis showed a mean difference of -1.78 letters (95%-CI: -6.61 to infinity, H0; mean. diff. ≤ 5 letters: p = 0.136). Fewer injections were needed in the relaxed regimen, with a mean difference of -2.34 (95%-CI: -4.11 to -0.56, p = 0.01). Tolerating up to 100 μm subfoveal subretinal fluid achieves good visual outcomes in our 24-month follow-up period, in patients treated with aflibercept for nAMD, with significantly fewer injections needed.",

Animals with LIM of Groups III (n = 15), IV (n = 15) and V (n = 15) received three 4-weekly intravitreal injections of panitumumab at doses of 25, 50 and 100 μg, respectively, into their right eyes, and of phosphate-buffered saline into their left eyes. Inter-eye differences in axial elongation (right eye minus left eye at study end) decreased (p < 0.001) from 0.00 ± 0.02 mm (Group I) and - 0.01 ± 0.02 mm (Group II) to -0.09 ± 0.03 mm (Group III), -0.12 ± 0.03 mm (Group IV) and - 0.17 ± 0.05 mm (Group V). Interocular choroidal thickness differences (measured by optical coherence tomography) increased (p < 0.01) from Groups I and II to Groups III-V. Western blot analysis showed an increase (p < 0.05) in expression levels of EGFR and its downstream phosphorylated signalling molecule, p-PI3K, in Group II compared to Group I and a decrease in Groups III-V compared to Group II (all p < 0.01). Interocular differences in retinal thickness did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the groups. TUNEL staining revealed no significant differences in retinal apoptotic cell density among any groups (all p > 0.05). Intravitreally administered panitumumab in young guinea pigs with LIM resulted in a dose-dependent and treatment frequency-dependent reduction in axial elongation, supporting the role of EGFR signalling in axial elongation.",

  "abstract": "Inflammation is a key mechanism underlying age-related macular degeneration (AMD); however, the specific circulating inflammatory proteins involved remain unclear. This study investigated the causal relationship between 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and AMD using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. We conducted a two-sample magnetic resonance imaging MR analysis using genomewide association study (GWAS) data. Five MR methodologies were applied, with inverse variance weighting (IVW) as the primary approach. We applied false discovery rate (FDR) correction to mitigate false positives. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Additionally, Steiger's test, reverse MR analysis, and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) were used to validate the results. Five inflammatory proteins demonstrated significant associations with overall AMD, including three associated with wet AMD and one associated with dry AMD. LDSC analysis indicated that, except for fibroblast growth factor-19, no genetic correlation confounded the causal relationships. Additionally, the expression of the identified proteins was unaffected by the genetic prediction of AMD. This study highlights the causal relationship between specific inflammatory proteins and AMD, emphasizing their potential roles in AMD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.",

  "abstract": "Pancreatic surgery, associated with technical difficulties and high complication rates, remains a challenge for surgeons. The laparoscopic approach has been shown to have benefits over the open approach; however laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) still has its challenges. Robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) offers a technical edge over the laparoscopic approach in terms of superior imaging and ergonomics. Whether the technical advantages translate into improved outcomes is to be established. The aim of this study was to produce an overview of systematic reviews, summarising the evidence to date comparing RDP and LDP in terms of intraoperative, postoperative, and oncological outcomes and assessing the quality of the included reviews. Three electronic databases, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus, were searched to identify systematic reviews with meta-analyses comparing RDP with LDP. The AMSTAR-2 format was used to assess the quality of the studies. Fourteen systematic reviews were identified for inclusion. RDP had a significantly higher rate of spleen preservation, significantly shorter hospital stay, and a significantly lower rate of conversion to open surgery, whilst having higher total costs compared to LDP. The overall quality of the reviews was variable. The evidence suggests that RDP has potential advantages over LDP in terms of higher spleen preservation rate, shorter hospital stays, and lower conversion rate to open surgery, whilst maintaining comparability with most other outcomes. Based on the variable quality evidence, RDP is a safe alternative to LDP. Key Words: Pancreatectomy, Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy, Robotic surgery, Outcome.",

Existing therapies mostly target symptoms, rather than addressing the underlying causes of the disease, leaving a burden of unmet clinical needs. Emerging evidence suggests a significant role for the gut microbiota and associated immune responses in influencing brain development and function, changing the paradigm of a brain-centric origin of NDDs. This review discusses the pivotal interactions within the gut-immune-brain axis, highlighting how microbial dysbiosis and immune signaling contribute to neurological pathologies. We also explore the potential of microbial management and immunomodulation as novel therapeutic avenues, emphasizing the need for a shift towards addressing the root causes of these disorders rather than just their symptoms.

In this study, we assessed the gut microbiota in 50 genetically confirmed DMD patients (median age 13.1 years) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Cognitive assessment was performed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales, with ID defined as an IQ < 70. Stool samples were analyzed, and statistical methods were used to assess alpha- and beta-diversity. Thirty-four percent of patients had ID. No significant differences were found in alpha-diversity or in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. However, beta-diversity analysis revealed significant differences between DMD + and DMD - groups, including, in DMD + , an increased abundance of Propionibacterium and Bifidobacterium, and a reduction in Bulleidia. These bacteria are involved in metabolic pathways that can influence neurological health through the gut-brain axis, particularly via the production of short-chain fatty acids. While these preliminary findings suggest a possible association between gut microbiota profile and cognitive impairment in DMD, further research is needed to explore a causal relationship and consider microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies.",

This includes the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, toxicity, impact on adipose tissue, and how this tissue becomes metabolically dysfunctional, contributing to the emergence of insulin resistance and other comorbidities in PLWH. Considering the impact of the modern obesogenic environment and that PLWH on INsTI-ART are living longer, a coordinated approach by infectious disease specialists and other physicians to address the metabolic complications affecting this population, is imperative. The use of new anti-obesity drugs is becoming part of co-medication to limit weight gain in this population.",

This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study included chronic hepatitis C patients <18 years old evaluated by pediatric hepatologists at an academic health system between 1/1/2017 and 9/30/2022. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) ≥12 weeks following treatment completion in patients initiating DAAs. Secondary endpoints were CoC advancement, variables impacting DAA initiation, patient-reported side effects, and adherence. An ordinal logistic regression model assessed whether initiation time was associated with a patient's ability to swallow, prior authorization outcome, and medication availability to HSSP at referral. The odds ratio reflects the likelihood of a shift in time to initiation for a given group relative to its respective reference group. Of 98 patients evaluated by a hepatologist, 73 (75%) were referred to the HSSP. Loss to follow-up was the primary reason (88%; 22/25) for non-referral, most commonly (73%; 16/22) in those aged ≤5 years. Following HSSP referral, 88% (64/73) initiated DAA and 92% (59/64) of those achieved SVR. Time from HSSP referral to medication initiation was impacted by DAA availability [OR=41.47; 95% CI: 9.51, 180.87; p<0.001] and inability to swallow the dosage form at evaluation [OR=3.94; 95% CI: 1.56, 9.98; p=0.004]. Over half (53%; 34/64) of patients initiating DAA reported ≥1 adverse event; none discontinued treatment. Most (69%; 44/64) reported no missed doses. The largest CoC drop-off occurred following initial clinic evaluation, primarily in children ≤5 years. Enhanced linkage to care efforts are needed in these patients. Conversely, nearly all patients referred to the HSSP were initiated on DAA, completed therapy, and achieved SVR.",

Moreover, delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation for children living with HIV may aggravate outcomes. We used a survey study administered to Brazilian maternities to evaluate compliance with individual PTHIV prevention interventions as well as the overall compliance using a combined endpoint. We also investigated associations with the average number of births per month and municipal social vulnerability index (SVI) using regression models. Next, using data from Brazilian HIV monitoring systems, we obtained information on age at first HIV viral load (VL) testing and age at first antiretroviral dispensation to evaluate delayed diagnosis (first VL testing ≥6 months) and delayed antiretroviral initiation (first dispensation ≥12 months) among children living with HIV, investigating associations with race/ethnicity, sex and SVI. Of 801 maternities, only 21% were compliant with the combined endpoint. Facilities located in cities with higher SVI and those with a lower number of births per month had lower odds of being compliant. Among 1152 children living with HIV, the median age at first HIV VL testing was 3 months (range 0-18) and 24% had a delayed diagnosis. Children living with HIV in cities with higher SVI had higher odds of delayed diagnosis. The median age at antiretroviral initiation was 6 months (range 1-120), and those with a delayed diagnosis had higher odds of delayed treatment initiation (aOR 4.9, 95% CI 3.5-9.9). Our study reveals significant challenges in access to PTHIV prevention, timely diagnosis and timely treatment initiation for children living with HIV, potentially related to social determinants.",

  "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder in the world. Most patients with MASLD are undiagnosed, untreated and unreferred. Treatment depends on diagnosis and accurate staging of fibrosis risk, and therefore screening at the primary care setting coupled with consistent, timely, evidence-based, widely accessible, and testable management processes is critical. Randomized controlled trials of methods for screening, diagnosis, severity stratification, and referral are lacking. We previously validated the MASLD clinical care pathway (MCCP), a multistep algorithmic process geared to support primary care settings in screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and suggested referral and treatment of patients with MASLD. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the MCCP intervention compared to usual care in improving MASLD care process and patient outcomes. A two-arm, parallel, cluster-randomized trial will assess the effect of the MCCP intervention comprised of an e-trigger and structured provider education on screening, diagnosis, referral, and treatment for MASLD. Clusters are Veterans Affairs (VA) patient-centered primary care clinics, called Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs). This 4-year study will include three phases: (1) formative assessment to explore barriers to feasibility and acceptability of intervention among providers and patients and adapt MCCP for utilization by VA PACTs, (2) cluster-randomized trial to examine the effectiveness of the MCCP compared to usual care, and (3) summative evaluation to identify patient and provider characteristics associated with effectiveness of MCCP and plan for future implementation. The primary outcome will be a composite dichotomous variable for making a new MASLD diagnosis and completing severity risk stratification of MASLD. Secondary outcomes include referral and receipt of hepatology specialty care for patients with MASLD and advanced fibrosis. Our randomized controlled trial will be the first to systematically implement the MCCP using strategies that are clinically relevant, adaptable and scalable. If successful, the MCCP will improve outcomes for patients with MASLD through early detection, accurate risk stratification, and timely treatment within primary care settings. This trial has been registered on clinicaltrails.gov (# NCT06671886), registration date: 10-31-2024.",

Identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical outcomes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor initiation and ocular inflammatory attack frequency, is critical for improving management. This study aimed to identify biomarkers predicting the clinical course of BD using peripheral blood test data and unbiased clustering combined with machine learning. A retrospective cohort study of 238 BD patients diagnosed at Tokyo Medical University Hospital (2004-2020) was conducted. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was applied to peripheral blood data, dividing patients into distinct groups. Machine learning techniques were used to explore biomarkers predicting the clinical course. Cluster analysis identified four groups: Group A (low C-reactive protein), Group B (high angiotensin-converting enzyme), Group C (high anti-streptolysin O), and Group D (low neutrophil count). Group C had a higher rate of TNF inhibitor initiation (47%, p = 0.04), while Group D had fewer ocular inflammation attacks per year (1.4, p = 0.04). Logistic regression analysis identified red blood cell count (p < 0.01) and monocyte percentage (p = 0.02) as predictive biomarkers for TNF inhibitor initiation. Machine learning further confirmed mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) as a significant predictor of TNF inhibitor initiation. Additionally, multiple regression analysis identified the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio as a predictor of the number of inflammatory attacks per year (p = 0.02). Unsupervised clustering of blood test data identified distinct BD clinical phenotypes. Monocyte percentage may predict TNF inhibitor initiation, while neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio may predict ocular inflammation frequency, highlighting pathophysiologic heterogeneity in BD.",

  "abstract": "Influenza poses a significant medical burden and has the potential to cause global pandemics. To better understand the epidemiological characteristics of influenza reinfections and identify factors associated with an increased risk of reinfection, we analyzed influenza data from 2010 to 2023 obtained from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting Information System in Chongqing, China. The Andersen-Gill model was used to evaluate the association between demographic characteristics and the risk of reinfection. A total of 676,811.47 person-years were observed, with a median time to reinfection of 9.40 months. The log-rank test revealed significant differences in reinfection probability by sex, age, occupation, and residence (  < .001). Independent risk factors for influenza reinfection included male sex (adjusted hazard ratio [a ]: 1.026, 95% confidence interval [ ]: 1.004-1.049), age ≤ 5 years (aH : 4.645, 95%  : 4.292-5.027), 6-18 years (a : 3.891, 95%  : 3.574-4.235), age 46-64 years (a : 1.336, 95%  : 1.158-1.541), and age ≥ 65 years (a : 2.946, 95%  : 2.533-3.426), urban residency (a : 1.353, 95%  : 1.315-1.391), and preschool-aged children (a : 2.103, 95%  : 1.830-2.416). Influenza reinfection in Chongqing is relatively common and significantly associated with several key factors, including male sex, age ≤ 18 or > 45 years, preschool-aged children, and urban residency. These findings underscore the importance of tailored public health strategies, particularly promoting influenza vaccination among at-risk groups, to protect vulnerable populations from reinfection.

  "abstract": "Globally, chronic respiratory diseases have become the third leading cause of death, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, and have been threatening human life for a long time. To alleviate the disease burden, it is crucial to develop rapid and convenient screening methods for COPD, preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm), and asthma. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath can reflect the pathophysiological processes of disease, thereby having the potential to serve as a promising approach for diagnosing respiratory diseases. Can we identify VOC markers in breath with the potential to serve as classification indicators, and further establish learning models for the early detection of COPD, asthma, or PRISm patients? This is a cross-sectional study in which exhaled breath samples were collected from 184 patients with COPD, 66 patients with asthma, 72 PRISm individuals, and 45 healthy individuals. From August 2023 to June 2024, the breath samples were analyzed using portable micro gas chromatography (CXBA-Alpha, ChromX Health Co., Ltd.). Potential VOC markers for classification were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. Subsequently, classification models were established by machine learning algorithms, based on these VOC markers along with baseline characteristics. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of these models were calculated to assess their overall discriminatory performance. A total of 367 patients were enrolled in our study. We identified nine VOCs distinguishing COPD patients from healthy controls, nine VOCs differentiating the PRISm population from healthy controls, five VOCs separating asthma patients from healthy controls, five VOCs distinguishing COPD patients from asthma patients, and seven VOCs differentiating the PRISm population from asthma patients based on breathomics feature selection. We utilized five algorithms to establish diagnostic models and selected the optimal one among them. The random forest model best distinguished COPD from healthy controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 ± 0.01. The support vector classifier (SVC) model was most effective in separating PRISm from healthy controls, achieving an AUC of 0.78 ± 0.01. Logistic regression performed well in discriminating asthma from PRISm (AUC, 0.74 ± 0.02) and COPD (AUC, 0.92 ± 0.01), in contrast, the random forest model differentiated asthma from healthy controls with an AUC of 0.81 ± 0.02. VOC panel-based classification models have the potential to be a novel strategy for the discrimination of chronic respiratory diseases. Using the portal micro gas chromatography enables swift detection of chronic respiratory disease and, most importantly, facilitates the rapid identification of PRISm individuals within the population.",

  "abstract": "Patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have poor prognosis. Current cisplatin-based first-line chemotherapy offers limited survival benefits. Cisplatin induces single-strand DNA breaks, activating DNA repair mechanisms that diminish its effectiveness. Here, we present the design, chemical synthesis, and therapeutic evaluation of a new generation of chemotherapeutic agents (Aurkines) with unique polyelectrophilic properties. These agents cause a high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks, bypassing DNA repair, and promoting cancer cell death. Two novel compounds, Aurkine 16 and Aurkine 18, were designed and evaluated for their antitumor effects in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant CCA cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), healthy cholangiocytes, and in vivo models. Aurkines effectively induced double-strand DNA breaks, leading to increased DNA damage and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, resulting in greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin in CCA cells. Phosphoproteomic and molecular analysis revealed that cisplatin activates DNA repair pathways, while Aurkines primarily induce apoptosis. Importantly, Aurkines also triggered apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant CCA cells and CAFs without harming healthy cholangiocytes. Additionally, Aurkines demonstrated cytotoxicity in other cisplatin-resistant cancers, such as breast and ovarian cancer. This tumor selectivity results from reduced uptake, increased efflux, and compact chromatin structure in normal cells, limiting Aurkine-DNA interactions. In vivo, Aurkines inhibited the growth of subcutaneous naïve and cisplatin-resistant CCA tumors, as well as orthotopic tumors in immunocompetent mice promoting antitumor immune cell recruitment, without any adverse events. Transport studies revealed that Aurkines were selectively taken up by OCT1, OCT3, CTR1, and OATP1A2, whereas only CTR1 transported cisplatin. Aurkines represent promising therapeutic drugs for both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancers due to their unique polyelectrophilic properties and selective targeting of malignant cells. This study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy designed to induce frequent double-strand DNA breaks selectively in both naïve and cisplatin-resistant cancer cells, without evident toxic side effects at therapeutic doses. This approach may settle the basis for new strategies to overcome the critical challenge of drug resistance in cancer treatment, and has the potential to be a breakthrough not only for the treatment of biliary tumors but also for other cancers.",

  "abstract": "The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) experienced with low-level viremia (LLV) remains poorly defined. This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic utility of serum HBV RNA as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in this population. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 117 pediatric patients with LLV (mean age: 13.14 years; 34% female) treated with continuous entecavir (ConT) or modified regimens (switching to or combining with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for ≥ 120 weeks. Virological response was defined as HBV DNA < 10 IU/mL at week 120. No significant baseline differences existed between ConT and modified regimen groups. Compared to ConT, modified regimens achieved greater reductions in serum HBV DNA, HBV RNA, and quantitative HBsAg, with higher cumulative undetectable rates at week 120 (HBV DNA: ≥ 80.0%; HBV RNA: ≥ 54.8%; P < 0.05). Notably, qHBsAg levels remained elevated in most patients, with only 3 individuals achieving undetectable levels (< 0.05 IU/mL). Multivariate analysis identified higher HBV RNA levels at week 48 as an independent risk factor for non-virological response (adjusted odds ratio: 5.86; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-24.62; P = 0.016). Although HBV RNA alone was less predictive than HBV DNA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.76 vs. 0.80; P = 0.459), combining both markers improved prediction accuracy (AUC: 0.82; P < 0.05 vs. single markers). In children with LLV, serum HBV RNA level is an independent risk factor for non-virological response and may serve as a complementary biomarker to HBV DNA for guiding antiviral therapy adjustments.",

  "abstract": "Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are a major global public health problem, associated with infertility, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and significant social and economic burdens. These challenges are particularly severe in underprivileged communities. A 2024 World Health Organisation report highlighted a global surge in STIs, requiring intensified efforts to improve their control and management. In order to appropriately respond and reverse the status quo, it is important to understand the extent to which the current interventions have reached the beneficiaries. This study aimed to assess the coverage of sexually transmitted infection (STI) services using the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) approach in eight districts of Central Uganda. A household survey was conducted in eight districts, targeting four population groups: mothers of children aged 0-11 months, women aged 15-49 years, men aged 15 + years, and youth aged 15-25 years. LQAS was used, with each district stratified into five supervision areas (SAs). In each SA, 19 respondents were randomly sampled from each target group. The survey assessed key indicators related to STIs, including knowledge of STI symptoms, knowledge of actions to take when infected with an STI, and engagement in risky sexual behavior. The study also examined condom use during risky sex, circumcision acceptance and non-acceptance among men, including reasons for its acceptance or non-acceptance. Overall and district-specific coverage was calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Indicator coverage in the SAs was classified using LQAS decision rules (DRs) for each indicator, using the overall coverage as benchmark for setting the DR. The findings revealed that mothers of children aged 0-11 months demonstrated superior knowledge of STIs and appropriate actions to take if one has an STI. Men (15 + years) and youth (15-24 years) reported engaging more in risky sexual behavior compared to women 15-49 years and mothers of children aged 0-11 months. Relatedly, men 15 + years reported higher condom use during risky intercourse. Youth were more likely to be circumcised than older men. Coverage for most indicators varied across SAs and districts. However, one in forty of the SAs fell short of average coverage in all the indicators. Personal hygiene was the leading motivator for circumcision acceptance while fear of pain was the leading driver for refusal to accept being circumcised. The findings highlight vital disparities in STI knowledge and risky sexual behavior among different demographic groups. These findings inform public health strategies to address STI disparities and improve reproductive health outcomes. District and SA-specific bottleneck analysis is recommended in order to provide actionable solutions to improve low-indicator coverage in low-coverage districts and SAs.",

Patients with ADC who underwent NACT or NACRT and surgery between 2015 and 2020 were included. The correlation between pTR and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after both treatments was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. pTR was assessed by using the Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG). Overall, 563 patients were included; 278 received NACT, and 285 NACRT. The incidence of pCR was significantly higher after NACRT (24.6% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.0001). The TRG of both node-negative (pN0) and node-positive (pN+) patients significantly correlated with the 5 years OS after NACT (pN0 p = 0.03, pN+ p = 0.01). The same result was not detected in NACRT patients (pN0 p = 0.98, pN+ p = 0.23). The 5-year DFS of the patients with pCR was higher in the NACT group (84% vs. 66.5%, p = 0.05). The proportion of patients showing distant recurrences was significantly higher in the NACRT group (35.4% vs. 23.8%, p = 0.009). Tumor regression grade was significantly associated with survival after NACT, but not with NACRT.

  "abstract": "In the Netherlands, the annual expenditure on HIV care was reported as €202 million in 2019, with about 70% allocated to antiretroviral therapy (ART). The introduction of generic antiretroviral medications (ARVs) in 2017 has offered potential cost-saving opportunities in healthcare. Understanding the financial implications of incorporating generic ART into the Dutch healthcare system is crucial to determine its impact. We used data from the Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics (SFK), covering 98% of all community and outpatient clinic pharmacies across the Netherlands. This dataset contained medication information from 2016 to 2022. Medication data were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification with Defined Daily Dose (ATC/DDD) system. Cost analysis was based on Dutch drug prices ( www.medicijnkosten.nl ) for a specified period, and the data were processed using IBM SPSS. In the Netherlands, people with HIV receiving ART increased from 20,072 to 24,573 between 2016 and 2022. HIV medication expenditure was €190 million euros in 2016, with generic medication at 6% DDDs. After an increase in 2017, a subsequent decrease in total HIV medication expenditure led to an overall cost of €181 million in 2022 (-5.1% compared to 2016). Simultaneously, the proportion of DDDs dispensed as a generic increased to 16-32% over the years. This could be linked to 97% compliance with generic substitutions for ARVs where a generic equivalent was available. Notably, the cost per patient per year has declined from €9,488 in 2016 to €7,352 in 2022 (-22.5% compared to 2016). Some of the potential cost-savings through generic substitution were not utilized because of the 20% point increase in the use of novel branded single-tablet regimens (STRs). Our analysis showed high compliance with generic substitution of ARVs in the Netherlands. The increased use of generic ARVs was accompanied by an almost 10% reduction in overall expenditure on ART despite a significant increase in the number of patients in care in the Netherlands during this period. A significant contributing factor to ART costs appears to be the high percentage of prescribed patented Single-Tablet Regimens (STRs). These findings underscore the complex dynamics of pharmaceutical expenditures in the Dutch healthcare system.",

Advances in drug therapy and surgical treatment for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have improved patient outcomes; however, it remains a typical intractable cancer with a poor prognosis. ICC is one of the key tumors for which effective treatment may be identified through CGP testing. This study aimed to identify ICC harboring actionable genetic variants using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CE-US). We enrolled 26 ICC patients who underwent CE-US before chemotherapy or surgery. Three ultrasound specialists reviewed the images by consensus and assessed the imaging features, including vascularity. Pathological data were reviewed after diagnosis using CE-US. We retrospectively analyzed distinctive CE-US findings in patients with ICC with actionable genetic variants. Twelve ICC patients had actionable gene variants, including four FGFR2 fusions, one FGFR2 rearrangement, six IDH1 mutations, and one BRAF V600E mutation. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in bile duct invasion (p = 0.0217) and blood vessel penetration within the tumor (p = 0.0012). Multivariable logistic regression identified blood vessel penetration within the tumor (OR = 18.275; 95% CI: 1.331-250.925; p = 0.0297) as independently associated with actionable gene variants. Patients with ICC and blood vessel penetration on CE-US should be considered for CGP testing.",

All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

We constructed separate distance regression models for each of the 8 subnetworks covering the entire brain, while controlling for the baseline brain networks, sex, and the number of volumes removed during motion scrubbing from head motion in the scanner. Worse baseline CS predicted lower community structure integrity at 30-months in the visual network (VN, β=0.0115; p<0.0001), dorsal attention network (DAN, β=0.0075; p=0.0089), and default mode network both at rest (β=0.0173; p<0.0001) and during the MI task (DMN, β=0.0103; p=0.0002). No other networks showed significant associations. The DAN did not have a relationship with CS at baseline but was significant at 30-months. Similar findings were observed in models that additionally controlled for baseline MoCA and change in MoCA score over 30 months. Poor CS may identify a subset of older adults at risk of future decrements in brain circuits important for vision, cognitive and mobility functions.

  "abstract": "Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is absent from global public health agendas. Our study is the first to comprehensively examine SLD prevalence in Canada, focusing on sex differences. We used data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging between 2012 and 2018. Steatosis was identified using the validated NAFLD Ridge Score. Using the most recent diagnostic criteria, we defined metabolic (dysfunction)-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), metabolic dysfunction-associated alcohol-associated liver disease (MetALD), and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and estimated prevalences by sociodemographic factors. Survey-weighted adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for MASLD (sex-stratified) and MetALD were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. A total of 24,888 people (51.4% female; median age 58 years) were included. The most common subtype of SLD was MASLD, 35% (95%CI, 34-36), followed by MetALD 2.6% (2.3-2.9), and ALD 0.8% (0.6-1.0). Overall, the prevalences for MASLD and MetALD were significantly higher among males at 46% (45-48) and 3.7% (3.2-4.2) compared to females at 24% (23-26) and 1.6% (1.2‒2.1), respectively. Lower household incomes were associated with higher MASLD prevalence in females (aPR, 2.9, 2.4-3.5) and males (aPR, 1.1, 1.0-1.3). Multimorbidity was high among the MASLD group; 31 unique MASLD phenotypes based on cardiometabolic characteristics were identified. Females with MASLD were also more likely to have more cardiometabolic conditions compared to males with MASLD. In this large Canadian cohort, we found significant sex differences in SLD burden and cardiometabolic features. Epidemiological assessments are necessary to improve preparedness for the significant projected increase in advanced liver disease. RéSUMé: OBJECTIF: La stéatose hépatique (SH) est absente des plans d’action mondiaux pour la santé publique. Notre étude est la première à examiner en profondeur sa prévalence au Canada en mettant l’accent sur les différences entre les sexes. MéTHODE: Nous avons utilisé les données de 2012 à 2018 de l’Étude longitudinale canadienne sur le vieillissement (ÉLCV). La stéatose a été identifiée à l’aide de l’outil NAFLD Ridge Score validé. En utilisant les critères de diagnostic les plus récents, nous avons défini la maladie stéatosique du foie liée à une dysfonction métabolique (MASLD), la MASLD avec consommation accrue d’alcool (MetALD) et la maladie hépatique associée à l’alcool (ALD) et nous en avons estimé les prévalences en fonction de facteurs sociodémographiques. Des ratios de prévalence ajustés (RPa) avec des poids de sondage pour la MASLD (stratifiés par sexe) et pour la MetALD ont été estimés à l’aide d’une régression de Poisson avec des erreur-types robustes. RéSULTATS: Au total, 24,888 personnes (51,4% de femmes; âge médian de 58 ans) ont été incluses. Le sous-type le plus courant de SH était la MASLD, avec 35% (IC de 95%: 34–36), suivi de la MetALD, avec 2,6% (2,3–2,9), et de l’ALD, avec 0,8% (0,6–1,0). Dans l’ensemble, les prévalences de la MASLD et de la MetALD étaient sensiblement plus élevées chez les hommes, à 46% (45–48) et 3,7% (3,2–4,2), que chez les femmes, à 24% (23–26) et 1,6% (1,2‒2,1), respectivement. Le faible revenu du ménage était associé à une prévalence plus élevée de la MASLD, tant chez les femmes (RPa: 2,9, 2,4–3,5) que chez les hommes (RPa: 1,1, 1,0–1,3). La multimorbidité était élevée dans le groupe de la MASLD; 31 phénotypes uniques de MASLD basés sur les caractéristiques cardiométaboliques ont été identifiés. Les femmes atteintes de MASLD étaient aussi plus susceptibles de présenter des troubles cardiométaboliques que les hommes atteints de MASLD. CONCLUSION: Dans cette grande cohorte canadienne, nous avons trouvé des différences significatives entre les sexes pour ce qui est de la charge de morbidité de la SH et des caractéristiques cardiométaboliques.

  "abstract": "Mechanical ventilation is an effective strategy for managing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it can also exacerbate lung injury, leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). To investigate the protective role of interleukin-37 (IL-37) in the pathogenesis of VILI, we used two approaches, human IL-37 transgenic (IL37tg) mice and administration of recombinant human IL-37 (rIL37) in wild-type (WT) mice subjected to mechanical ventilation. Lung histopathology was evaluated, inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) were measured, and inflammasome activation was assessed by analyzing NLRP3 and Caspase-1 expression. As a result, IL37tg mice exhibited significantly attenuated lung injury compared to WT controls, characterized by improved histological morphology, reduced lung injury scores, and decreased infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. Similarly, rIL37 administration markedly reduced lung injury and decreased inflammatory cytokine levels. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of the alveolar cell marker surfactant protein D (SP-D) and IL-37. Furthermore, IL-37 suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by reduced NLRP3 and Cleaved-Caspase-1 levels in both the IL37tg mouse model and the rIL37 treatment group. These findings suggest that IL-37 effectively protects against VILI by inhibiting inflammation in lung tissues through inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, IL-37 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of VILI in the future.",

  "abstract": "Caspases are critical regulators of cell death, development, innate immunity, host defense, and disease. Upon detection of pathogens, damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, or other homeostatic disruptions, innate immune sensors, such as NLRs, activate caspases to initiate distinct regulated cell death pathways, including non-lytic (apoptosis) and innate immune lytic (pyroptosis and PANoptosis) pathways. These cell death pathways are driven by specific caspases and distinguished by their unique molecular mechanisms, supramolecular complexes, and enzymatic properties. Traditionally, caspases are classified as either apoptotic (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9, and -10) or inflammatory (caspase-1, -4, -5, and -11). However, extensive data from the past decades have shown that apoptotic caspases can also drive lytic inflammatory cell death downstream of innate immune sensing and inflammatory responses, such as in the case of caspase-3, -6, -7, and -8. Therefore, more inclusive classification systems based on function, substrate specificity, or the presence of pro-domains have been proposed to better reflect the multifaceted roles of caspases. In this review, we categorize caspases into CARD-, DED-, and short/no pro-domain-containing groups and examine their critical functions in innate immunity and cell death, along with their structural and molecular mechanisms, including active site/exosite properties and substrates. Additionally, we highlight the emerging roles of caspases in cellular homeostasis and therapeutic targeting. Given the clinical relevance of caspases across multiple diseases, improved understanding of these proteins and their structure-function relationships is critical for developing effective treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Interleukin-23 (IL-23), a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines, plays a critical role in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation and is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Therapies targeting the p19 subunit of IL-23 have recently expanded the therapeutic options for IBD demonstrating efficacy and safety for the treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). Thus, in this review, we provide an overview of agents targeting the IL-23 pathway in CD, highlighting similarities and differences of specific IL-23 inhibitors. Furthermore, we summarize key phase 3 trials and head-to-head trials, focusing on design features and interpretation. Finally, we discuss the positioning of selective IL-23 agents for CD treatment along with areas of unmet clinical needs. However, real-world data will offer additional comparative effectiveness information, data for disease subtypes, and insights into the long-term outcomes of IL-23 inhibition. Looking ahead, ongoing phase 3 studies testing p19-specific selective IL-23 inhibitors are expected to expand the therapeutic options for patients with complex phenotypes, including those with extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs), fistulas, and strictures. Advances in molecular and cellular characterization, including the development of predictive molecular biomarkers, may help guide clinical decision-making, enabling more personalized treatment approaches. Precision medicine studies may further enhance our understanding of the molecular biology of IL-23, shedding light on how these agents work in complex CD and clarify their potential complementary or synergistic effects with other therapies.",

  "abstract": "Esophageal stricture is the principal complication associated with endoscopic resection (ER) in patients with superficial esophageal cancer (SEC), and medical intervention may be required to prevent esophageal stricture after ER. The aim of this study was to compare acellular dermal matrix (ADM) transplantation and esophageal mucosal autograft (EMA) transplantation in terms of efficacy in preventing esophageal stricture after ER for SEC. Between May 2017 and November 2022, 48 patients with SEC who underwent EMA or ADM after ER were enrolled in this study. The primary outcomes measured included esophageal stricture, refractory esophageal stricture, and the number of endoscopic dilations after esophageal stricture. A total of 48 patients with SEC were enrolled in this study, 17 of whom underwent EMA after ER (EMA group) and 31 of whom underwent ADM after ER (ADM group). The median of total procedure duration and the median of transplantation duration in the ADM group was significantly shorter than that in the EMA group (Z = - 2.408, P = 0.016; Z = - 2.710, P = 0.006). During the follow-up, 4 patients developed refractory esophageal stricture in the EMA group and 1 developed refractory esophageal stricture in the ADM group. The rate of refractory esophageal stricture was lower in ADM group than in EMA group (3.2% vs. 23.5%, P = 0.047). In patients with > 3/4 circumferential range ER, the rate of refractory esophageal stricture was also lower in ADM group than in EMA group (4.0% vs. 25.0%, P = 0.067). Among the patients who developed esophageal stricture, the median number of endoscopic dilations in the ADM group was less than that in the EMA group (Z = 27.500; P = 0.040). Compared with EMA, ADM provided several advantages, as it reduced the number of endoscopic dilations for patients with esophageal strictures and shortened the procedure duration for patients who underwent esophageal ESD.",

  "abstract": "The mechanism of the lipid paradox remains uncertain, and malnutrition may be 1 explanation. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the associations between baseline remnant cholesterol (RC) concentrations and clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke, stratified by nutritional status. Patients with ischemic stroke in a single-center prospective cohort (Shanghai, China) from January 2018 to December 2022 were studied. Individuals were classified into 3 groups based on their Controlling Nutritional Status score. Poor outcome and all-cause mortality during up to 3 months of follow-up were compared among patients with varied nutritional status and RC levels utilizing multivariate logistic regression analyses, RC splines, and subgroup analyses. A total of 6892 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the cohort, of which 5257 patients were included in the present study (without malnutrition: 2418 [46.0%]; mild malnutrition: 2516 [47.9%]; moderate-severe malnutrition: 323 [6.1%]). The median age was 69±12 years, and 3398 (64.6%) were male. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition had the highest risks of poor outcome (198 [61.3%];  <0.001) and all-cause mortality (106 [32.8%];  <0.001) during the 3-month follow-up. A higher baseline RC level was an independent protective factor for adverse outcomes in patients with any degree of malnutrition ( <0.05), which was not observed in patients without malnutrition. In addition, compared with the moderate-severely malnourished with RC <0.471 mmol/L, the adjusted odds ratios for poor outcome and all-cause mortality were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.450-1.438) and 0.898 (0.502-1.607) for participants with 0.471 to 0.632 mmol/L, 0.259 (0.095-0.704) and 0.222 (0.061-0.810) for 0.633 to 0.868 mmol/L, and 0.160 (0.037-0.689) and 0.202 (0.042-0.967) for ≥0.869 mmol/L, respectively. The lipid paradox was only observed in the malnourished patients with ischemic stroke. Strict lipid reduction therapy is still recommended for patients without malnutrition. However, when treating patients at any risk of malnutrition, the improvement of nutritional status may be more crucial.",

It is in senescence, survival, and growth under normal physiological and pathological conditions, including neoplasms. Additionally, this pathway has been recognized as essential for the regulation of the cell cycle. Several previous studies have indicated that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can be influenced by various natural products, with resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) being a particularly important phytoalexin polyphenol in this context. This review explores the impact of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway on the initiation and advancement of various cancerous conditions and the potential of resveratrol to target this signaling mechanism. The review begins by summarizing the anti-tumor capabilities of resveratrol and then emphasizes the significant role of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the progression of multiple malignancies.

Au@Pt NRs were induced to be assembled on the surface of Au NPAs by CHA technique when the target was present. The sensing system catalyzed the TMB to generate oxidized TMB (oxTMB) with strong SERS signals, and the SERS signals were further amplified by CHA. The sensing system demonstrated excellent analytical performance, achieving ultrasensitive detection of miR-196b and miR-221, tumor markers of gastric precancerous lesions, with detection limit as low as aM level. It also had the capability of simultaneous dual-target detection, which had shown satisfactory clinical utility and accuracy in the detection of actual serum samples. Introducing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of sensing system in detecting precancerous lesions of gastric cancer, the area under the curve (AUC) values for target combination diagnosis were 0.954 and 0.957, respectively. Therefore, the proposed dual function sensing system has broad application prospects in the clinical detection of precancerous lesions of gastric cancer.",

However, due to their impact on extra-cerebral acetylcholine signaling, concerns about cardiac adverse effects, including QT interval prolongation, persist. Despite this, evidence-based guidelines for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring during ChEI treatment are lacking, and prior studies on ChEIs and corrected QT intervals (QTc) yield inconsistent findings. This study aimed to investigate the association between ChEI use and changes in QTc intervals among older adults. We collected retrospective data from first-time visitors to the geriatric memory clinic of Turku City Hospital in 2017 and 2019. We included patients who were newly prescribed ChEIs and had ECG data available (n = 126, mean age 81.1 years, 56.3% female). QTc prolongation was defined as ≥460 ms in females and ≥450 ms in men. Paired   tests compared QTc means before and during ChEI use, and McNemar tests analyzed changes in the proportion of prolonged QTc. Mean ± SD QTc (ms) before versus during ChEI use was: 420.8 ± 24.0 versus 423.9 ± 28.0 (  = .13) for donepezil; 416.0 ± 20.4 versus 416.5 ± 26.1 (  = .92) for galantamine; 416.1 ± 22.3 versus 409.6 ± 20.1 (  = .30) for rivastigmine; and 419.7 ± 23.4 versus 421.5 ± 27.3 (  = .34) for all ChEIs. Prolonged QTc occurred in 7.9% of patients before versus 12.7% during ChEI use (  = .21). We found no statistically significant association between ChEI use and QTc interval prolongation or an increased proportion of pathological QTc values during ChEI treatment.

  "abstract": "Mental health issues represent a prevalent challenge for employees and their employers, leading to substantial impacts on individuals, society, and the economy. Different employee mental health programs (EMHPs) can support employees in preventing and treating mental health issues. However, the impact of such EMHPs depends largely on the use behavior of employees. This study aimed to gain deeper insights into employees' attitude and use behavior regarding EMHPs by investigating (1) employee preference and intention to use EMHPs, (2) factors that predict use, and (3) key facilitators and barriers influencing use. An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach was applied, including a scoping review, qualitative interviews, and a quantitative web-based survey. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 employees to gain insights into EMHPs from the employee perspective and inform the creation of a web-based questionnaire. The quantitative web-based survey was conducted to collect representative primary data on employees' perspectives on different EMHPs using 7-point Likert scales. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics, including repeated measures ANOVAs and chi-square tests. The final sample of the web-based survey consisted of 1134 participants and was representative across several sociodemographic characteristics. Analysis of the sample revealed that when given the choice, employees preferred digital (n=666, 58.73%) and self-intervention (n=590, 52.03%) EMHPs. Employees were most likely to use EMHPs focused on prevention (mean 4.89, SD 1.61). Intention to use EMHPs was predicted by age (young: mean 4.59, SD 1.2; old: mean 4.19, SD 1.4; P<.001; Cohen d=0.32), education (academic degree: mean 4.68, SD 1.24; no academic degree: mean 4.26, SD 1.32; P<.001; Cohen d=0.32), and mostly by company culture (positive company culture: mean 4.61, SD 1.27; negative company culture: mean 3.99, SD 1.27; P<.001; Cohen d=0.49). Cost coverage (n=345, 30.42%) and ease of use (n=337, 29.72%) were critical facilitators of use. Employers can have a positive contribution to employee mental health by starting to offer EMHPs, preferably digital self-intervention programs for prevention; creating and maintaining the right work environment and culture; and ensuring cost coverage for the EMHP.",

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, primarily due to late-stage diagnosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of natural compounds in enhancing the efficacy and reducing the side effects of conventional cancer treatments. Baicalin, a bioactive compound from Scutellaria baicalensis, exhibits significant anticancer properties. This study aimed to investigate the role of baicalin in modulating lung cancer cell behavior through the arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12)-mediated ferroptosis pathway. We employed cyber pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to predict and validate the interaction between baicalin and ALOX12. In vitro experiments were conducted on A549 lung cancer cells to assess the effects of baicalin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression levels of ALOX12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroptosis markers, such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long-Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4), were measured. Baicalin treatment significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression in lung cancer cells, and this upregulation was associated with a reduction in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, baicalin-induced ferroptosis was characterized by increased ROS levels, iron accumulation, and elevated expression of GPX4 and ACSL4. These findings suggest that baicalin enhances ferroptosis through ALOX12 activation, synergistically inhibiting cancer cell growth. Baicalin significantly upregulated ALOX12 expression, promoted ferroptosis, and inhibited the proliferation and migration of A549 lung cancer cells. This finding provides evidence for the potential use of baicalin as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer and highlights the importance of ALOX12 in lung cancer treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Several lines of treatment can be used sequentially in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. We investigated the evolution of patient/tumor characteristics and their prognostic impact across treatment lines to develop an overall prognostic score (OPS). Individual patient data from 48 randomized trials were analyzed. The end point was overall survival (from random assignment to death). Missing data were imputed. The complete data set was then separated into construction (80%) and validation sets (20%). The Cox's model was used to define risk groups for survival using the OPS. The discrimination capability was assessed in each treatment-line via bootstrapping to obtain optimism-corrected calibration and discrimination C-indices. Internal validation was done in the validation set. A total of 37,560 patients (26,974 in first-line [1L], 7,693 in second-line [2L], and 2,893 in third-line [3L]) were analyzed. Some clinical, biological, and molecular characteristics of patients/tumors included in therapeutic trials evolve over the lines. Seven independent prognostic variables were retained in the final multivariate model common to all lines: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, hemoglobin, platelet count, WBC/absolute neutrophil count ratio, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and the number of metastatic sites. The OPS was used to define four patient subgroups with significantly different prognoses in 1L, 2L, and 3L, separately, with adequate C-indices: 0.65, 0.66, and 0.69 in the construction set and 0.65, 0.66, and 0.68 in the validation set, respectively. The OPS was not predictive, with 3L drugs (  placebo) or subsequent line (2L/1L or 3L/2L) extending survival in all prognostic groups. The same prognostic model using practical variables can be used before all treatment lines. The OPS could better stratify patients in future clinical trials and help to therapeutic decision in routine practice.",

  "abstract": "To compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of three anesthetic techniques during microwave ablation (MWA) for subpleural stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This prospective, single-center clinical trial enrolled patients with subpleural stage I NSCLC between January 2024 and December 2024. Patients were assigned to one of three anesthesia groups: intercostal nerve block (INB), pleural infiltration anesthesia (PIA), or local anesthesia (LA). The primary endpoints were perioperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores and the incidence of adverse events within 30 days of MWA. Sixty patients (mean age 73.88 ± 6.44 years; 28 men) were included in the analysis. The PIA group had intraoperative VAS scores comparable to the INB group and significantly lower than the LA group (2.70 ± 1.34 vs. 2.85 ± 1.73 vs. 6.26 ± 1.41, respectively). Postoperatively, VAS scores at 2 h were significantly lower in the PIA and INB groups compared to the LA group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed between the PIA and INB groups (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.35 ± 1.63 vs. 2.25 ± 1.02). There was no significant difference in VAS scores at 24 h post-ablation (0.80 ± 1.24 vs. 1.40 ± 1.57 vs. 1.50 ± 1.64). The technical success and efficacy rates were 100%. No procedure-related deaths occurred within 30 days of MWA, and most adverse events were minor. INB and PIA significantly reduced perioperative pain compared to LA. No significant difference in adverse events incidence was observed among the three groups.",

  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are rising in China, with high body mass index (BMI) established as a significant risk factor. However, comprehensive evidence regarding the BMI-attributable CRC burden in the Chinese population remains limited. This study aims to analyze the trend of CRC burden attributable to high BMI (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m ) in China from 1990 to 2021 and to predict its development from 2022 to 2035, in order to provide a scientific foundation for the formulation of public health policies. We analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) to assess the BMI-attributable CRC burden in China from 1990 to 2021. Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models. Future projections through 2035 were generated using Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling. The Das Gupta method was used to explore the contribution of population growth, aging, and epidemiologic factors to these burden changes. From 1990 to 2021, China's BMI-attributable CRC burden increased substantially, with ASMR and ASDR rising at annual rates of 2.393% (95% CI 2.306-2.481) and 2.305% (95% CI 2.188-2.422), respectively. The mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) rate both increased with age. Males showed higher burden rates in most age groups. Projections indicate continued increases in ASMR (2.43% annually) and ASDR (2.44% annually) through 2035. Epidemiological factors were the primary drivers, contributing 99.73% to mortality changes and 44.81% to DALYs changes. The BMI-attributable CRC burden in China shows a concerning upward trajectory that is predicted to continue, with epidemiologic factors playing a major role. Urgent public health interventions targeting obesity prevention, lifestyle modification, and expanded CRC screening are needed to mitigate this growing burden.",

In this study, we included a total of 4,625 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database spanning from 2001 to 2008. We calculated indices related to central obesity for each participant and then employed univariate logistic regression, multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) analysis. we found that the indices of Weight, Waist Circumference (WC), waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR), and Body Roundness Index (BRI) were significantly elevated in the BPH group. In terms of dietary intake, we found that the intake of total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and cholesterol was significantly higher in the BPH group, with polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol meeting the criteria for both univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Weight, WC, WHtR, and BRI can effectively improve the prediction of BPH, which may be associated with the high intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Appropriately adjusting the types and total amount of fat intake may prevent the occurrence of prostatic hyperplasia.",

  "abstract": "The microbiome is a significant multimicrobial community that coexists with the human body in a symbiotic relationship. These microbial communities participate in mechanisms, such as defense against infections, absorption of nutrients, and maintenance of internal homeostasis. Although the microbiome is involved in physiological processes that are beneficial to host health, it can also lead to serious problems. Despite being far apart, the oral cavity and colon are both highly colonized by different microbial communities. Studies have shown that oral bacteria can migrate to and colonize the colon, which is most evident in diseases such as periodontitis. These oral pathogenic bacteria, which contain a large number of carcinogenic factors such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, can penetrate the large intestine and cause intestinal microbial imbalance and dysfunction, thereby stimulating carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence suggests that oral microbiota, especially certain periodontal pathogens, may be used as biomarkers for colorectal cancer (CRC). Understanding the exact mechanisms of microbiome interactions and their impact on CRC will provide future opportunities for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, and is an important prerequisite for its use as a precise noninvasive biomarker, which is crucial for the early detection of CRC. This review aims to summarize the current research status of oral microbiota, gut microbiota, and their association with CRC, and to evaluate the effectiveness of oral microbiome-derived biomarkers.",

  "abstract": "Identifying individuals with dementia is crucial for prevalence estimation and service planning, but reliable, scalable methods are lacking. We developed novel set algorithms using both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, applying Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for dementia case identification. Our cohort (n = 1082) included individuals aged ≥ 60 with dementia identified through specialist clinics and a comparison group without dementia. Clinicians from Australia and the United States informed predictor selection. We developed algorithms through a biostatistics stream for structured data and a natural language processing (NLP) stream for text, synthesizing results via logistic regression. The final structured model retained 16 variables (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.853, specificity 72.2%, sensitivity 80.6%). NLP classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest models) performed comparably. The final, combined model outperformed all others (AUC = 0.951, P < 0.001 for comparison to structured model). Embedding text-derived insights within algorithms trained on structured medical data significantly enhances dementia identification capacity. Algorithmic tools for detection of individuals with dementia are available; however, previous work has used heterogeneous case definitions which are not clinically meaningful, and has relied on proxies such as diagnostic codes or medications for case ascertainment. We used a novel, dual-stream algorithmic development approach, simultaneously and separately modeling a clinically meaningful outcome (diagnosis of dementia according to specialized clinical impression) using structured and unstructured electronic health record datasets. Our clinically grounded case definition supported the inclusion of key structured variables (such as dementia International Classification of Disease codes and medications) as modeling predictors rather than outcomes. Our algorithms, published in detail to support validation and replication, represent a major step forward in the use of routinely collected data for detection of diagnosed dementia.",

  "abstract": "Many of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are children and adolescents, and the incidence of pediatric IBD is increasing. However, understanding epidemiological trends is crucial for effective prevention and treatment and reducing the local and global burden of IBD. Little data exist regarding the incidence of IBD in the child population in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Voivodeship. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of IBD in the period 2011 - 2022 and to compare the data regarding three types of IBD, namely ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and unclassified inflammatory bowel disease (IBD-U), from the first half, i.e. 2011 - 2016, to the second half, i.e. 2017 - 2022. This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 118 IBD patients hospitalized at the Department of Pediatrics, Allergology and Gastroenterology from the central-northern part of Poland. Of the 118 patients diagnosed with IBD, 48 (40.68%) had CD, 57 (48.31%) had UC, and 13 (11.01%) had IBD-U. Between 2011 and 2016, 48 new IBD patients were diagnosed, with a further 70 new cases added between 2017 and 2022, representing a significant increase over the period (P = 0.033). Also, a significant increase was seen for UC, i.e. rising from 19 new cases between 2011 and 2016, to 38 between 2017 and 2022 (P = 0.015). The increase in CD was not significant. The incidence of pediatric IBD in the central-northern district of Poland is lower than other countries, it nonetheless appears to be increasing, particularly in children with UC. The number of IBD diagnoses in children has increased by nearly 50% over the last 6 years.",

  "abstract": "Early identification of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children is important to prevent chronic symptoms and long-term negative consequences. However, PTSD often goes unrecognized in the emergency setting of hospitals and screening methods for young children are lacking. To evaluate the accuracy of an early screening tool for PTSD in a sample of young children (0-7 years) after unintentional injury. The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale - Early Screener (PEDS-ES) was administered to parents of children referred to the Emergency Department within 7 days post-accident (  = 82), and a validated interview for PTSD was administered 3 months after the accident as criterion measure: the Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment (DIPA). Diagnostic accuracy of the PEDS-ES was inspected using area under the curve analyses including sensitivity, specificity, Positive and Negative Predictive Value. After three months PTSD diagnosis was established in 21% of the children. Use of the PEDS-ES within 7 days after the injury showed fair accuracy with AUC = .727. Sensitivity (0.65) and specificity (0.73) for the suggested cutoff of 8 were moderate for predicting PTSD diagnosis 3 months after the injury. The examination of cutoff values that achieve enhanced sensitivity in a screening context - where sensitivity is prioritized - while maintaining a high level of specificity suggests that a lower cutoff of around 6 points may serve as a more sensitive (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.56) valid alternative cutoff score. The PEDS-ES allows for successful early screening of risk for traumatic stress symptoms in young children after single accidental injury. It enables early identification of individuals who are at risk for developing PTSD and need further monitoring of symptoms, diagnostic assessment and treatment. In young children at emergency settings of hospitals, development of PTSD often goes unrecognized, while consequences can be debilitating.The Pediatric Emotional Distress Scale-Early Screener (PEDS-ES) for PTSD risk in young children after accidental injury shows fair predictive power.Young children at increased risk for PTSD can be identified early and offered secondary preventive interventions.",

This single-center, retrospective, observational cohort study included chronic hepatitis C patients <18 years old evaluated by pediatric hepatologists at an academic health system between 1/1/2017 and 9/30/2022. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response (SVR) ≥12 weeks following treatment completion in patients initiating DAAs. Secondary endpoints were CoC advancement, variables impacting DAA initiation, patient-reported side effects, and adherence. An ordinal logistic regression model assessed whether initiation time was associated with a patient's ability to swallow, prior authorization outcome, and medication availability to HSSP at referral. The odds ratio reflects the likelihood of a shift in time to initiation for a given group relative to its respective reference group. Of 98 patients evaluated by a hepatologist, 73 (75%) were referred to the HSSP. Loss to follow-up was the primary reason (88%; 22/25) for non-referral, most commonly (73%; 16/22) in those aged ≤5 years. Following HSSP referral, 88% (64/73) initiated DAA and 92% (59/64) of those achieved SVR. Time from HSSP referral to medication initiation was impacted by DAA availability [OR=41.47; 95% CI: 9.51, 180.87; p<0.001] and inability to swallow the dosage form at evaluation [OR=3.94; 95% CI: 1.56, 9.98; p=0.004]. Over half (53%; 34/64) of patients initiating DAA reported ≥1 adverse event; none discontinued treatment. Most (69%; 44/64) reported no missed doses. The largest CoC drop-off occurred following initial clinic evaluation, primarily in children ≤5 years. Enhanced linkage to care efforts are needed in these patients. Conversely, nearly all patients referred to the HSSP were initiated on DAA, completed therapy, and achieved SVR.",

A total of 837 pediatric patients with ALL who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from July 2010 to November 2017 were retrospectively analyzed, 48 children with positive   fusion gene were detected by the real-time quantitative PCR techniques and their data were retrospectively collected for analysis. Among 48 cases with positive   fusion gene, there were 26 males and 22 females, with onset ages ranging from 9 months to 13 years old. There were 2 cases (4.2%) in the low-risk group, 32 cases (66.7%) in the intermediate-risk group, and 14 cases (29.1%) in the high-risk group at initial diagnosis. The white blood cell (WBC) counts of 25 cases (53.2%) at initial diagnosis were <50×10 /L, 11 cases (23.4%) were (50-100)×10 /L, and 11 cases (23.4%) ≥100×10 /L. The main immunophenotype was common-B ALL (44 cases, 91.7%). Other leukemia fusion genes such as   and   were not observed in this cohort of patients. All patients received the treatment of NPCLC-ALL2008 protocol, and 5 cases (10.4%) occurred poor prednisone response. All the 48 cases achieved complete remission (CR) after the induction treatments. The last follow-up date was April 30, 2023. A total of 5 children relapsed, including 1 case with intermediate risk and 4 cases with high risk. The recurrence rate in the high-risk group was significantly higher than that in the intermediate- and low-risk groups (both   < 0.05). Most relapsed children had elevated WBC counts at initial diagnosis. Among them, WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was observed in 4 cases. The recurrence rate among children with WBC counts ≥100×10 /L was significantly higher than that with WBC counts <100×10 /L (  < 0.01). Four deaths occurred in this cohort, of which 3 died of leukemia recurrence.

However, SGLT2-inhibition increases glucagon levels, which facilitate postprandial hyperfiltration. The impact of SGLT2 inhibition on protein-related hyperfiltration and postprandial (intra) kidney haemodynamic function is unclear. Moreover, the interaction with dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors, known to reduce glucagon levels and to affect meal-related factors modulating GFR, is unknown. We aimed to assess the effects of empagliflozin and linagliptin in mono- and combination therapy compared to the initiation and intensification of SU-derivative gliclazide treatment on fasting and postprandial kidney haemodynamic function. We compared three 16-week glucose-lowering strategies added to ongoing metformin monotherapy: (1) EMPA-LINA: 8-week empagliflozin 10 mg QD (EMPA0-8w) followed by the addition of 8-week linagliptin 5 mg QD (LINA8-16w); (2) LINA-EMPA: 8-week linagliptin (LINA0-8w) followed by the addition of 8-week empagliflozin (EMPA8-16w) versus (3) GLIC-GLIC: 8-week gliclazide 30 mg QD (GLIC0-8w) followed by the addition of 8-week gliclazide 30 mg (GLIC8-16w). We studied (intra) kidney haemodynamic interactions of this combination using iohexol and PAH clearance techniques to assess measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). We studied n = 61 overweight people with T2D (HbA1c 62 + 11 mmol/mol, eGFR 89 [78-100] mL/min/1.73 m  and urinary albumin-creatinine-ratio 1.0 [0.4-1.9] mg/mmol). In the fasting state, EMPA0-8w (-13.2; -21.3 to -5.1 mL/min) but not LINA0-8w reduced within-group mGFR. EMPA8-16w (-10.2; -16.5 to -4.0 mL/min) but not LINA8-16w reduced within-group mGFR. Following a proteinload, EMPA0-8w (-11.4; -20.2 to -2.6 mL/min) and EMPA8-16w (-16.2; -22.9 to -9.4 mL/min) but not LINA0-8w or LINA8-16w reduced within-group mGFR. Versus the comparatorarm, fasting mGFR EMPA0-8w, EMPA8-16w and EMPA-LINA and postprandial mGFR EMPA8-16w and LINA-EMPA, were significantly reduced. mGFR reductions resulted from intrakidney efferent vasodilation rather than afferent vasoconstriction. In T2D people without CKD, the favourable kidney haemodynamic effects of empagliflozin persist in the postprandial state and are irrespective of concurrent use of linagliptin.",

  "abstract": "Exposure to air pollution and meteorological conditions, such as humidity, has been linked to adverse respiratory health outcomes in children. This study aims to develop predictive models for pediatric hospitalizations based on both environmental exposures and clinical features. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2500 children (aged 1-18) who presented with respiratory symptoms at the emergency department, during 2016-2017. Air pollution data, including NOx and NO  concentrations, and relative humidity (RH) were collected from nine monitoring stations and were cross-referenced with the children's residential locations to assess their specific exposure level. Statistical tests, including Chi-square and Wilcoxon tests, were used to analyze the data. Machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were developed to predict the children's hospitalizations. Boys were more likely to be hospitalized than girls (60.6% vs. 39.4%, p = 4.31e-06). Hospital visits peaked during winter (p = 3.56e-37). Increased emergency room visits were statistically significantly associated with highly polluted days (p = 0.038). Hospitalized children were exposed to lower RH (median 64.9%) compared to nonhospitalized children (median 69.4%, p = 0.005). The RF and XGBoost models were reliable, with accuracy rates of 0.7-0.98, Precision scores of 0.88-0.99, and AUC scores of 81%-99%. Key features included temperature, NOx levels, RH, and exposure to SO . This study investigates the effects of air pollution and humidity on pediatric respiratory health. The models developed offer valuable tools for predicting hospitalizations and are intended to support public health planning and resource allocation.",

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the accessibility of telehealth (TH) and forced a trial of incorporating remote care into routine CF care. The CF Learning Network (CFLN) organized for data sharing into a telehealth innovation lab (TH-iLab) to improve access to the interdisciplinary care team and co-produced shared agenda-setting. All persons with CF (PwCF) with a CF diagnosis in the CF Foundation Registry (CFFPR) from 1/2020-12/2021 were included and categorized into CFLN TH-iLab, CFLN TH-iLab non-participants, and non-CFLN programs. standardized TH implementation in the CFLN TH-iLab is associated with increased access to the CF care model and results in similar lung function and nutrition health outcomes. In 2020 and 2021, the average number of TH visits per person per year and the percentage of PwCF with one or more TH visits per year were higher in the CFLN TH-iLab than in the other groups. Lung function was highest in PwCF, followed by a program that was part of the CFLN TH-iLab in 2020 and 2021. Anthropometric measurements, spirometry, and attainment of microbiology cultures were similar among all three groups. Access to interdisciplinary care was highest in the CFLN non-TH-iLab group. Integrating TH into CF care in the CFLN TH-iLab provided access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic without compromising clinical outcomes. Further research on optimizing the telehealth experience for PwCF can help better understand TH's long-term impact on CF care.",

  "abstract": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of death globally in children aged 0-5 years. Early access to pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in low-resource, pre-hospital settings may result in improved pediatric pneumonia outcomes. However, few data exist regarding their application in such settings. We performed an exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to examine use of pulse-oximetry and supplemental oxygen in pre-hospital environments of Malawi. Our model yielded an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for pre-hospital pulse-oximetry use of $35 (USD) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted compared to no pulse-oximetry use. One-way sensitivity analysis showed highest sensitivity to the parameter of downstream hospitalization cost. Given that inpatient management is the standard of care for hypoxemic pneumonia, when only pre-hospital costs were considered the result was an ICER of $9.9/DALY averted. Both values were considered cost-effective according to a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold set for 1x the average GDP per capita in Malawi ($588, 2018). When oxygen was analyzed in combination with pulse-oximetry, we found a baseline WTP threshold for pre-hospital oxygen of $71 per patient. For every 1% reduction in total pediatric pneumonia mortality consequent to pre-hospital oxygen use, we determined the recommended WTP allowance for oxygen would increase by approximately $4.53. We conclude that pulse-oximetry is likely cost-effective in low-resource, pre-hospital environments. We acknowledge the need for further research on the effectiveness of pre-hospital oxygen in reducing pediatric pneumonia mortality and suggest ranges of cost and efficacy for which oxygen is likely to be found cost-effective in tandem with pulse-oximetry.",

Of 200 consecutively recruited children with a previously proven diagnosis of PBB 62 (12.2 years, female 48%) were interviewed after 7.7 (5.4-14.7) years about their previous and current symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs: spirometry, body plethysmography, nitrogen multi-breath washout, exhaled nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide) were performed. Children with persistent symptoms were offered lung imaging. 11 (17.7%) patients suffered from chronic or recurring wet cough years after their first PBB episode. 15 (24.19%) had at least one abnormal spirometry parameter. FEV1 was abnormal in eight of 62 (12.9%), LCI 2.5% in seven of 56 (12.5%), FVC in 12 of 62 (19.35%) and FEV1/FVC in five of 62 (8.06%) cases. PFT did not differ between children with and without wet cough. Lung MRI/CT demonstrate in four of nine cases abnormalities of the bronchial walls, including one with incipient bronchiectasis. After PBB in early childhood, a significant proportion of children suffer from respiratory symptoms many years later, some have an objectively reduced lung function and structural changes of the bronchial wall despite adequate initial therapy. Wet cough alone seems not to be a sensitive clinical predictor. Due to the retrospective study design, we cannot proof any causal relationship. However, to detect late bronchopulmonary sequelae, continuous follow-up of these children should become mandatory.",

We aimed to assess whether changes in estimated arterial CO₂ (PaCO₂) derived from transcutaneous measurements (P CO₂) were associated with pediatric weaning failure. Children (age 72 h -18 years) with MV > 12 h were continuously monitored using a transcutaneous sensor to estimate PaCO₂ from skin CO₂ tension (P CO₂). Values were recorded during SBT (30 min on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) +5 cmH O, with pressure support of +5 cmH O for endotracheal tubes with internal diameter ≤ 3.5 mm), then up to 6 h after extubation. Mean P CO  and P CO  changes during SBT, and after extubation, were retrospectively collected to evaluate their association with SBT failure and extubation failure (reintubation within 48 h). Eighty children (median [IQR] age 1.1 [0.3; 8.7] years) were included, with 89 SBT (14 failures, 75 successes). Sixty-four patients were extubated following their first SBT, with 10 (16%) extubation failures. P CO  changes were not associated with SBT and extubation failures.

The IVW method indicated a positive correlation between USPR levels and MI (IVW, odds ratio = 1.504, 95% confidence interval: 1.108-2.041, P = 0.009). In contrast, the inverse analysis provided evidence suggesting that MI affected USPR (P > 0.05). The Cochran Q test showed heterogeneity, while the intercept test revealed no horizontal pleiotropy, and the leave-one-out analysis demonstrated that the analyses were reliable. This study provides evidence for the causal effect of the USPR on MI; however, this was not the case in the opposite situation. It is plausible that the USPR serves as a promoting factor for MI.",

This study aimed to examine the association between different CHG bathing frequencies and CLABSI rates in medical intensive care units (MICUs). A retrospective analysis was conducted in three MICUs in northern Taiwan from March 2018 to June 2022. One MICU implemented daily CHG bathing for 21 months, followed by every-other-day CHG bathing for 30 months, while two MICUs used water and soap as standard care. CLABSI rates per 1000 central line days and other clinical outcomes were compared. Across 46 409 central line days and 5482 admissions, 357 CLABSI events were recorded. No significant difference in CLABSI rates was found between the CHG and standard care groups (IRR = 1.1, p = 0.36) or between the different CHG bathing frequencies (IRR = 0.68, p = 0.06). Other clinical outcomes showed no significant differences. CHG bathing, whether daily or alternate-day, was not significantly associated with lowering CLABSI rates in MICU. The association may vary depending on hospital-specific conditions and infection profiles. CHG bathing should not be regarded as a universal infection control strategy in ICUs. It should be evaluated within the context of each ICU's specific conditions and infection prevention strategy.",

  "abstract": "Migraine has an assumed polygenic basis, but the genetic risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies only explain a proportion of the heritability. We aimed to develop machine learning models, capturing non-additive and interactive effects, to address the missing heritability. This was a cross-sectional population-based study of participants in the second and third Trøndelag Health Study. Individuals underwent genome-wide genotyping and were phenotyped based on validated modified criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Four datasets of increasing number of genetic variants were created using different thresholds of linkage disequilibrium and univariate genome-wide associated p-values. A series of machine learning and deep learning methods were optimized and evaluated. The genotype tools PLINK and LDPred2 were used for polygenic risk scoring. Models were trained on a partition of the dataset and tested in a hold-out set. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was used as the primary scoring metric. Classification by machine learning was statistically compared to that of polygenic risk scoring. Finally, we explored the biological functions of the variants unique to the machine learning approach. 43,197 individuals (51% women), with a mean age of 54.6 years, were included in the modelling. A light gradient boosting machine performed best for the three smallest datasets (108, 7,771 and 7,840 variants), all with hold-out test set area under curve at 0.63. A multinomial naïve Bayes model performed best in the largest dataset (140,467 variants) with a hold-out test set area under curve of 0.62. The models were statistically significantly superior to polygenic risk scoring (area under curve 0.52 to 0.59) for all the datasets (p<0.001 to p=0.02). Machine learning identified many of the same genes and pathways identified in genome-wide association studies, but also several unique pathways, mainly related to signal transduction and neurological function. Interestingly, pathways related to botulinum toxins, and pathways related to the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor also emerged. This study suggests that migraine may follow a non-additive and interactive genetic causal structure, potentially best captured by complex machine learning models. Such structure may be concealed where the data dimensionality (high number of genetic variants) is insufficiently supported by the scale of available data, leaving a misleading impression of purely additive effects. Future machine learning models using substantially larger sample sizes could harness both the additive and the interactive effects, enhancing precision and offering deeper understanding of genetic interactions underlying migraine.",

The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study. The artificial intelligence model for real-time visual neurorecognition in total mesorectal excision was successfully established for the first time in China.

The present study was designed to explore the expression of FKBP51 in murine utricle hair cells (HCs) and the possible mechanisms underpinning the actions of FKBP51 relevant to gentamicin-mediated toxicity, with special attention given to nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activities in vitro. Here, we found, for the first time, that FKBP51 was widely expressed in both cytoplasm and cytomembrane. Moreover, the expression of FKBP51 in cultured HCs of utricle was downregulated after exposure to 1 mM gentamicin for 24 h. Then, the fkbp51 knockout mice were utilized to further investigate the role of FKBP51 in HCs in response to gentamicin. And the absence of FKBP51 led to severe HCs loss, accumulated ROS levels, and increased apoptotic factors, which could be alleviated by 2 mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) to certain degree. In addition, mechanistic studies with 10 mM BAY 11-7082 showed that FKBP51 protected HCs against gentamicin-induced damage, at least in part, via blocking the NF-κB pathway activation. Taken together, our new findings suggest that FKBP51 might serve as a new target for the prevention of HCs of utricle from aminoglycoside-induced vestibular toxicity.",

We developed novel set algorithms using both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data, applying Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for dementia case identification. Our cohort (n = 1082) included individuals aged ≥ 60 with dementia identified through specialist clinics and a comparison group without dementia. Clinicians from Australia and the United States informed predictor selection. We developed algorithms through a biostatistics stream for structured data and a natural language processing (NLP) stream for text, synthesizing results via logistic regression. The final structured model retained 16 variables (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.853, specificity 72.2%, sensitivity 80.6%). NLP classifiers (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest models) performed comparably. The final, combined model outperformed all others (AUC = 0.951, P < 0.001 for comparison to structured model). Embedding text-derived insights within algorithms trained on structured medical data significantly enhances dementia identification capacity. Algorithmic tools for detection of individuals with dementia are available; however, previous work has used heterogeneous case definitions which are not clinically meaningful, and has relied on proxies such as diagnostic codes or medications for case ascertainment. We used a novel, dual-stream algorithmic development approach, simultaneously and separately modeling a clinically meaningful outcome (diagnosis of dementia according to specialized clinical impression) using structured and unstructured electronic health record datasets. Our clinically grounded case definition supported the inclusion of key structured variables (such as dementia International Classification of Disease codes and medications) as modeling predictors rather than outcomes. Our algorithms, published in detail to support validation and replication, represent a major step forward in the use of routinely collected data for detection of diagnosed dementia.",

However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

Sin embargo, su importancia en el cáncer rectal localmente avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia neoadyuvante sigue sin explorarse.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronóstico de la reacción desmoplásica en muestras de pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia.DISEÑO:Este es un estudio retrospectivo.ESCENARIO:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un solo centro oncológico integral.PACIENTES:El estudio incluyó a 255 pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado que se sometieron a quimiorradioterapia basada en fluoropirimidina seguida de una escisión mesorrectal total entre 2005 y 2014. La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó en categorías madura, intermedia e inmadura según el análisis histológico.RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES:Los resultados primarios fueron la supervivencia sin recurrencia y la supervivencia general. RESULTADOS: La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó como madura (69,0%), intermedia (5,5%) o inmadura (25,5%). El grupo maduro tuvo un mayor porcentaje de buenos respondedores (34,1%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (0%) e inmaduro (4,6%) (p < 0,0001). El grupo maduro se correlacionó con mejores resultados, con una mayor supervivencia libre de recurrencia a 5 años (85,4%) y supervivencia general (93,0%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (45,1% y 76,2%, respectivamente) e inmaduro (65,8% y 88,8%, respectivamente). En el análisis multivariable, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció significativamente con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia ( p = 0,03). Entre los malos respondedores, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia (p = 0,03). La quimioterapia adyuvante no mejoró significativamente la tasa de supervivencia sin recurrencia a 5 años para el grupo maduro (quimioterapia adyuvante vs. ninguna quimioterapia, 86,4% vs. 84,8%; p = 0,64), observándose tendencias peores en el grupo combinado intermedio/inmaduro (55,9% vs. 69,4%, respectivamente, p = 0,27).LIMITACIONES:Las limitaciones incluyen la naturaleza subjetiva de la evaluación de la reacción desmoplásica y el diseño retrospectivo del estudio.CONCLUSIONES:La reacción desmoplásica en muestras quirúrgicas después de la quimiorradioterapia se asocia con respuestas a la quimiorradioterapia y sirve como un factor pronóstico significativo en el cáncer rectal avanzado, particularmente para aquellos que responden mal a la quimiorradioterapia.

  "abstract": "Mandibular bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) is a common procedure used in orthognathic surgery. The greatest complication of BSSO is damage to the inferior alveolar nerve, resulting in facial numbness and poor quality of life. This study aimed to create a low-cost, biomechanically accurate 3D-printed mandible model for surgical training to prevent such complications. A 3D mandible model was created from CT scans and printed using 12 different resin mixtures. Biomechanical testing was performed to determine percent elongation, tensile strength, yield strength, and Young's modulus. Four surgeons performed user testing to determine the most realistic model. The authors compared the osteotomy force profile of the best model to the human cadaveric mandible and commercially available model. A mix of 45% Anycubic Colored UV and 55% Siraya Tech Tenacious resins was found to best mimic human bone. Surgeons reported feeling an accurate proprioceptive transition between cancellous and cortical bone. The osteotomy force profiles were similar across our 3D-printed (left: 2.66±1.67 N, right: 3.23±1.80 N), cadaveric (left: 3.18±1.81 N, right: 2.16±0.96 N), and commercial (left: 2.69±1.68 N, right: 3.10±1.88 N) mandibles. On maximal force testing, this model (left: 6.18 N, right: 6.80 N) closely resembled the cadaveric mandible (left: 6.59 N, right: 3.99 N) and commercially available model (left: 6.31 N, right: 6.39 N). A low-cost 3D-printed mandible was developed and validated for surgical simulation in BSSO. Future applications include resident education and preoperative planning.",

  "abstract": "After neoadjuvant therapy, pathologic analysis of rectal cancer resected specimens may show a complete response in the primary tissue cancer with residual tumor in the lymph nodes (ypT0N+). The aim of this study was to describe the 5-year overall survival and factors associated with survival of ypT0N+ patients with rectal cancer who had neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and to compare these patients' survival with patients in other pathologic categories. We conducted a retrospective analysis. We used the National Cancer Database. We identified patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total neoadjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery between 2006 and 2016. Besides ypT0N+, 5 pathologic categories were identified: ypT0N0, ypT1-2N0, ypT3-4N0, ypT1-2N+, and ypT3-4N+. The primary outcome measure was 5-year overall survival. We included 30,751 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A total of 342 patients developed ypT0N+, of whom 181 (52.9%) received total neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients who received total neoadjuvant therapy, developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, ypT0N+ disease was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between ypT0N+ and ypT3-4N0 or ypT1-2N+. Similar findings were noticed among patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ypT0N+, older age, male gender, and higher number of positive lymph nodes were all associated with a decrease in the overall survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study, lack of variables describing the chemotherapy and radiation regimens used, and paucity of data on disease-specific survival or recurrence. Developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, it was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+.

  "abstract": "Cisplatin is an effective antineoplastic drug used worldwide in the treatment of various malignancies. However, it is associated with side effects, including cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been suggested as a promising drug to prevent or reduce cisplatin-derived ototoxicity. To evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy of NAC in preventing CIHL, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Library. Articles reporting the administration of systemic or transtympanic injection of NAC for CIHL prevention were considered. The outcomes of interest included the presence of hearing loss events and changes in hearing thresholds at 0.5 through 12 kHz following cisplatin treatment. A total of 7 studies involving 217 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 175 received systemic administration of NAC, and the remaining received transtympanic injection of NAC. No significant differences were found in CIHL prevention between the use of either systemic or transtympanic NAC administration compared to placebo (risk ratio [RR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54-1.19; P = .28, and RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.51-1.54; P = .67, respectively). No significant differences were found at 0.5 to 8 kHz between groups. Qualitative analyses suggested a tendency to otoprotection in ultra-high frequencies (10 and 12 kHz). Our findings suggest that, regardless of administration route, current published evidence does not show that NAC is effective in preventing CIHL in the standard clinical audiogram range. Further studies with larger samples are needed to confirm our findings. I.",

  "abstract": "Despite technical progress and novel ablation strategies, pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection still occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the elimination of antral low-voltage, fragmented electrograms (LFEGMs) identified by high-density (HD) mapping on the rate of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) durability. Sixty patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) were randomly assigned to a verification of PV entrance block and presence of LFEGMs on antral isolation lines with an HD mapping catheter (HD group) or to a verification of PV entrance block with a circumferential mapping catheter alone (CM group). In the HD group, LFEGMs were additionally ablated. Mandatory reassessment procedure to assess PVI durability and the presence of LFEGMs was performed 12 months after the index procedure or earlier in case of arrhythmia recurrence. A total of 107 out of 116 (92.2%) PVs were found durably isolated in the HD group, and 97 out of 120 (80.8%) PVs in the CM group (p = 0.02). At the reassessment procedure, a total of 7 [3, 12] and 34 [24, 44] LFEGMs were found in the HD and CM groups, respectively (p = 0.00002). Elimination of LFEGMs at the index procedure reduced the likelihood of antral conduction gaps in the same segments at the reassessment. Arrhythmia recurrence rate was similar between the HD and the CM group (7/29, 24.1% vs. 10/30, 33.3%), p = 0.62, respectively. Additional elimination of LFEGMs identified by HD mapping of antral isolation lines after PVI resulted in a significantly higher rate of PVI durability.

  "abstract": "Understanding pathological changes in the brain is essential for guiding treatment decisions in brain injuries and diseases. Despite significant advances in brain imaging techniques, clinical practice still faces challenges due to infrastructure reliance and high resource demands. This review explores the current knowledge on blood-based biomarkers that indicate brain pathology, which can assist in identifying at-risk patients, diagnosing patients, predicting disease progression, and treatment response. We focus on the inherited metabolic disorders X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) which share remarkable phenotypic variability. Disease-specific increases in the lipid metabolites lyso-PC26:0 in X-ALD and sulfatides in MLD might contribute to predicting clinical manifestation. Disease-unspecific biomarkers for axonal damage (neurofilament light chain protein, NfL) and glial degeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) are able to distinguish X-ALD and MLD phenotypes at the group level. The implementation of X-ALD into newborn screening programs in various countries, including several U.S. states, has increased the demand for predictive blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting the early conversion from the pre-symptomatic to the early neuroinflammatory cerebral form of X-ALD. Among different biomarkers, NfL has proven most effective in reflecting neuroinflammation and correlating with brain lesion volume and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based severity scores. We discuss how NfL has moved from initial proof-of-principle towards proof-of-concept studies in brain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and how this knowledge could be applied for the clinical implementation of NfL in rare inherited metabolic disorders such as X-ALD.",

  "abstract": "Prospective payment models have incentivized reductions in length of stay after surgery. The benefits of abbreviated postoperative hospitalization could be undermined by increased readmissions or postacute care use, particularly for older adults or those with comorbid conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hospitals with accelerated postsurgical discharge accrue total episode savings or incur greater postdischarge payments among patients stratified by age and comorbidity. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. National data from the 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files for July 2012 to June 2015 were used. We included Medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective colectomy and stratified the cohort by age (65-69, 70-79, ≥80 y) and Elixhauser comorbidity score (low: ≤0; medium: 1-5; and high: >5). Patients were categorized by the hospital's mode length of stay, reflecting \"usual\" care. In a multilevel model, we compared mean total episode payments and components thereof among age and comorbidity categories, stratified by hospital mode length of stay. Among 88,860 patients, mean total episode payments were lower in shortest versus longest length of stay hospitals across all age and comorbidity strata and were similar between age groups (65-69 y: $28,951 vs $30,566, p = 0.014; 70-79 y: $31,157 vs $32,044, p = 0.073; ≥80 y: $33,779 vs $35,771, p = 0.005) but greater among higher comorbidity (low: $23,107 vs $24,894, p = 0.001; medium: $30,809 vs $32,282, p = 0.038; high: $44,097 vs $46641, p < 0.001). Postdischarge payments were similar among length-of-stay hospitals by age (65-69 y: ∆$529; 70-79 y: ∆$291; ≥80 y: ∆$872, p = 0.25) but greater among high comorbidity (low: ∆$477; medium: ∆$480; high: ∆$1059; p = 0.02). Administrative data do not capture patient-level factors that influence postacute care use (preference, caregiver availability). Hospitals achieving shortest length of stay after surgery accrue lower total episode payments without a compensatory increase in postacute care spending, even among patients at oldest age and with greatest comorbidity.

  "abstract": "To illustrate improved posttonsillectomy hemorrhage rates with a novel cost-effective monopolar intracapsular tonsillectomy (ICT) technique. Retrospective cohort. Single physician's experience at a Midwest private practice. A single surgeon's chart review of 576 pediatric patients who underwent a tonsillectomy in the last 20 years was completed. In total, 331 cases were treated with ICT performed with a novel monopolar bovie electrocautery technique, as opposed to the more widely used microdebrider or coblator techniques. In total, 246 were treated with the traditional extracapsular tonsillectomy (ECT) technique using monopolar electrocautery. Of the 331 ICTs performed, one postoperative hemorrhage requiring intervention was identified, resulting in an ICT postoperative bleed rate of 0.3%. Of the 246 ECTs performed, 9 postoperative bleeds requiring intervention were identified, resulting in an ECT postoperative bleed rate of 3.7%. In this cohort, the relative risk of developing a bleed with ECT was 12 times higher than the bleed risk with ICT (  = .018). Every 30 cases of ICT prevented one tonsil bleed (number needed to treat [NNT] = 29.8). Potential savings of ICT with monopolar cautery is $1.5 to $1.6 million for every 10,000 cases that transition to ICT with electrocautery from a microdebrider or coblator technique. ICT with monopolar electrocautery resulted in a significantly decreased bleed rate compared to the ECT technique in this single surgeon experience and at a much lower cost compared to the more widely used microdebrider or coblator techniques.",

  "abstract": "The treatment of complex transposition of the great arteries with a ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis/left outflow tract obstruction poses significant challenges. The decision between performing a Rastelli procedure, a Nikaidoh procedure or a double root rotation depends on the cardiac anatomy, especially the location of the ventricular septal defect, its spatial relationship with the great arteries, the presence of straddling of the atrioventricular valve and the appreciation of the pulmonary valve. In our centre, our goal is to provide the most physiologic repair tailored to each patient's unique anatomy and to try to preserve the pulmonary valve in the pulmonary position, despite some degree of residual stenosis. We demonstrate three different surgical techniques adapted for various anatomies: one en bloc double root rotation, one double root translocation with separation of the roots and one modified Nikaidoh procedure.",

The cases were visually classified into predefined dementia patterns using  F-FDG PET by three experts. A region-of-interest (ROI)-based automated analysis of  F-FDG PET was also performed. The participants were followed up for 12 months, and the clinical diagnosis of dementia was re-evaluated.ResultsThe sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the visual reading of  F-FDG PET for differentiating AD from FTLD were 94%, 78%, and 92%, respectively. In contrast, those of p-tau181 in CSF were 62%, 79%, and 65%, respectively. The sensitivity, the primary endpoint, was 32% higher for  F-FDG PET than for p-tau181 in CSF. Additionally, the accuracy, the secondary endpoint, was 27% higher for  F-FDG PET than for p-tau181 in CSF. In addition to the visual reading of  F-FDG PET, the ROI-based automated analysis showed sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 81%, 79%, and 81%, respectively.ConclusionsThis study showed that the diagnostic performance of  F-FDG PET in differential diagnosis of AD and FTLD was higher than that of p-tau181 in CSF.Trial registrationUMIN-CTR (UMIN 000016427, https://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/) and Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs041180098, https://jrct.mhlw.go.jp/).",

  "abstract": "The Clavien-Dindo classification is widely used to report postoperative morbidity but may underestimate the severity of colectomy complications. The purpose of this study was to assess how well the Clavien-Dindo classification represents the severity of all grades of complications after colectomy using cost of care modeling. This was a retrospective cohort study. The study was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients (N = 1807) undergoing elective colon or rectal resections without a stoma performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 who were followed up for ≥90 days, were not transferred to other hospitals, and did not receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy were included in the study. Complication severity was measured by the highest-grade complication per patient and attributable outpatient and inpatient costs. Associations were evaluated between patient complication grade and cost during 3 time periods: the 90 days after surgery, index admission, and postdischarge (<90 d). Of the 1807 patients (median age = 62 y), 779 (43%) had a complication; 80% of these patients had only grade 1 or 2 complications. Increasing patient complication grade correlated with 90-day cost, driven by inpatient cost differences (p < 0.001). For grade 1 and 2 patients, most costs were incurred after discharge and were the same between these grade categories. Among patients with a single complication (52%), there was no difference in index hospitalization, postdischarge, or total 90-day costs between grade 1 and 2 categories. The study was limited by its retrospective design and generalizability. The Clavien-Dindo classification correlates well with 90-day costs, driven largely by inpatient resource use. Clavien-Dindo does not discriminate well among patients with low-grade complications in terms of their substantial postdischarge costs. These patients represent 80% of patients with a complication after colectomy. Examining the long-term burden associated with complications can help refine the Clavien-Dindo classification for use in colectomy studies. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B521.

  "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) is the primary treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), while its impact on sinonasal mucosa is unclear. We aimed to investigate the progression of sinus mucosal inflammation pre- and post-RT in NPC patients and aid in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced rhinosinusitis (RiRS). This study was based on a prospective cohort with 1410 NPC patients. RiRS was evaluated by the Lund-Mackay score (LMS). A prediction model incorporating clinicopathological factors, radiomics features, and dosimetric parameters was developed using least absolute shrinkage regression and validated internally and externally using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration tests, and decision curve analysis. LMS trajectories were analyzed using latent-class growth analysis. 1017 patients with a median follow-up of 106.5 months were enrolled. Before RT, 7.5 % of patients (n = 76) had rhinosinusitis, which has increased to 47.2 % after RT. The V30Gy of the sinuses (relative sinus volume receiving doses > 30 Gy), pre-RT LMS abnormalities, and tumor invasion of sphenoidal base independently influenced RiRS. The prediction model based on these three factors exhibited good discrimination and calibration. Three distinct trajectories of RiRS were identified: increasing LMS, decreasing LMS with a high starting score, and decreasing LMS with a low starting score. V70Gy showed significant association with the LMS trajectories. RiRS is a common complication in NPC patients, influenced by radiation dose in the sinuses, baseline sinus mucosa status, and tumor invasion. Patients with large sinus volumes receiving high radiation doses are more likely to develop RiRS.",

  "abstract": "Transvenous lead extraction (TLE) is recognized as an effective method of lead extraction, but can be challenging with old and tined pacemaker leads. We present the case of a 44-year-old male with cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) infection who underwent TLE of his 15-year-old tined pacemaker leads using a novel approach. A carotid shuttle sheath with the tip fashioned into a bevel shape was used as a makeshift dilator to dissect and free the leads from adhesions. A bioptome, introduced through the TightRail sheath, was employed to dislodge the right ventricular (RV) lead tip, while a snare introduced subsequently through the same access was used to grip the distal end of the RV lead. The lead was extracted using the snare without the need for additional femoral or jugular access. To the best of our knowledge, the use of this bioptome and snare technique, through the TightRail sheath, without employing femoral or jugular access for lead extraction, has not been previously reported. This case highlights the importance of innovative techniques in successfully addressing challenging TLE cases.",

To investigate the influence of adding High power pain threshold ultrasound technique to traditional therapy on axioappendicular muscles amplitude and fatigue of patients with mechanical neck pain. Single-blind, Randomized clinical trial. Outpatient clinic. Sixty patients (19-38 years old) with mechanical neck pain participated in this study and were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the faculty of physical therapy after a referral from an orthopedist. Patients were randomly assigned by the opaque sealed envelope to two treatment groups: Group A Received High power pain threshold ultrasound (HPPTUS), traditional therapy in form of (active range of motion, stretching exercises, and postural correction exercises (PCES), whereas Group B Received traditional therapy only; therapeutic sessions were performed Twice/week for 4 weeks. The visual analog scale, pressure pain threshold, neck disability index, upper trapezius and Levator scapulae median frequency, and root mean square were used to evaluate the patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment status. Multiple pairwise comparisons within each group revealed statistically significant differences in all outcome variables in both groups with favor to the HPPTUS group as p = 0.0001. Between group analysis at post treatment revealed statistical significant difference between both groups in all outcome variables as p = 0.0001. The High-power Pain Threshold Ultrasound technique combined with traditional therapy is an effective method more than traditional therapy alone for management the patients with MNP. The present study has implications, especially for clinical decision-making with regard to the therapy of choice in MNP to reduce pain, improve function and muscle activity through HPPTUS technique, and its impact on normal lifestyle and highlight the need for active intervention.",

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

  "abstract": "Hypertension is a significant public health issue, particularly among middle-aged and older adults. This study investigated the impact of multidimensional social participation, including its diversity and frequency, on hypertension in this population in China, with a focus on urban-rural differences. Using data from the 2015 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), which included 12 165 participants aged 45 and older, social participation was categorized by diversity (e.g., voluntary activities, Mahjong, cards, chess, or other clubs) and frequency. Hypertension was determined based on self-reported diagnoses, medication use, and blood pressure measurements. Logistic regression analyses, adjusted for demographic and health-related factors, revealed that more diverse social participation was associated with lower hypertension rates (OR = 0.718, 95% CI = 0.612, 0.840). Participating more than once a week also correlated with reduced hypertension risk (OR = 0.877, 95% CI = 0.803, 0.958). Specific activities, such as volunteering, internet use, and Mahjong, were notably protective against hypertension. Subgroup analyses highlighted urban-rural disparities, with differing impacts of social participation observed. However, interaction analyses showed that urban-rural residency did not significantly modify the relationship between social participation and hypertension. These findings emphasize the role of social participation in mitigating hypertension risk among middle-aged and older Chinese adults, and underscore the need for targeted public health strategies to address urban-rural disparities and promote social participation.",

  "abstract": "Numerous techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been described. The present study aims to determine the proportion of wrists with CTS in which the application of DN avoids surgery. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial clinical trial was performed. Eighty-six wrists with diagnosis of mild or moderate CTS and indication for surgery were recruited from a hospital traumatology service. The intervention group was treated with DN, with a frequency of one session/week over six weeks, while the control group did not follow any specific treatment, remaining on the waiting list for the surgery. The main variable was the recommendation for surgery. Other secondary variables included changes in electromyography and ultrasound; intensity of pain; Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ); hand dynamometries; and possible adverse effects. The wrists treated by DN had a reduced risk of needing surgery at 12 weeks by 62% compared to the control group (RR = 0.38, 95% CI[0.2-0.72]), with this value being significant (p-value = 0.003). This group also obtained a significant improvement in the intensity of pain (p-value = 0.006), and in the BCTQ-severity of syntoms scale and BCTQ-functional situation scale (p-value = 0.039 and p-value = 0.019 respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in the dynamometries performed, nor in the results of the electromyography and ultrasound studies. Adverse effects were infrequent or unimportant. Application of DN to wrists with mild or moderate CTS reduces the need for surgery, and improves the clinical symptoms and functionality of the hand.",

  "abstract": "Watchful waiting in patients with rectal cancer with complete clinical response after chemoradiation therapy has gained increased popularity to avoid morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. Irradiation of the pelvis causes bowel dysfunction, but the effect on anorectal sensory function remains obscure in this patient category. The aim of this study was to characterize the sensory pathways of the gut-brain axis in patients with rectal cancer treated solely with chemoradiation therapy (nonconventional regime/dose) compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study. Sensory evaluation by rectal distension was performed and cortical evoked potentials were recorded during rapid balloon distensions of the rectum and anal canal. Latencies and amplitudes of cortical evoked potentials were compared, and the relative amplitude of 5 spectral bands from recorded cortical evoked potentials was used as an additional proxy of neuronal processing. Patients with rectal cancer solely with chemoradiation therapy (n = 13) a median of 3.2 years ago (range, 2.3-5.6 y) and healthy volunteers (n = 13) were included. Cortical evoked potentials were measured. Patients had 35% lower rectal capacity at a maximum tolerable volume (p = 0.007). We found no differences in rectal cortical evoked potential latencies (p = 0.09) and amplitudes (p = 0.38) between groups. However, spectral analysis of rectal cortical evoked potentials showed a decrease in θ (4-8 Hz) and an increase in β (12-32 Hz) band activity in patients (all p < 0.001). Anal cortical potentials showed an increase in α (8-12 Hz) and β and a decrease in γ (32-70 Hz) band activity (all p < 0.001) in patients compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study of limited size. Chemoradiation therapy for distal rectal cancer causes abnormal cortical processing of both anal and rectal sensory input. Such central changes may play a role in symptomatic patients, especially when refractory to local treatments. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270. RESPUESTA NEURONAL ANORMAL A ESTÍMULOS RECTALES Y ANALES, EN PACIENTES TRATADOS POR CÁNCER RECTAL DISTAL, CON QUIMIORRADIOTERAPIA DE DOSIS ALTA, SEGUIDA DE ESPERA VIGILANTE: La espera vigilante en pacientes de cáncer rectal, con respuesta clínica completa después de la quimiorradiación, ha ganado una mayor popularidad en evitar la morbilidad y mortalidad asociadas con la cirugía.

Se compararon las latencias y amplitudes de los potenciales evocados corticales, y la amplitud relativa de cinco bandas espectrales registradas, de potenciales evocados corticales, se usaron como proxy adicional del procesamiento neuronal.Pacientes de cáncer rectal, únicamente con terapia de quimiorradiación (n = 13) mediana de 3.2 años (rango 2.3-5.6) y voluntarios sanos (n = 13).Potenciales evocados corticales.Pacientes tuvieron una capacidad rectal menor del 35%, al volumen máximo tolerable (p = 0.007). No encontramos diferencias en las latencias potenciales evocadas corticales rectales (p = 0.09) y amplitudes (p = 0.38) entre los grupos. Sin embargo, el análisis espectral de los potenciales evocados corticales rectales, mostró una disminución en theta (4-8 Hz) aumento en beta (12-32 Hz), y actividad en banda en pacientes (todos p <0.001). Los potenciales evocados corticales anales mostraron un aumento en alfa (8-12 Hz) y beta, disminución en gamma (32-70 Hz), y actividad en banda (todos p <0.001), en pacientes comparados a voluntarios sanos.Este es un estudio exploratorio de tamaño limitado.La quimiorradiación para el cáncer rectal distal, ocasiona procesos corticales sensoriales anormales anales y rectales. Tales cambios centrales pueden desempeñar un papel en pacientes sintomáticos, especialmente cuando son refractarios a tratamientos locales. Consulte Video Resumen en http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270.",

  "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss is a prevalent occupational hazard characterized by gradual, sensorineural hearing impairment, primarily affecting higher frequencies (3-6 kHz) due to prolonged exposure to excessive noise. The severity of hearing impairment is directly linked to sound pressure intensity, frequency, exposure duration, and pattern. Otolaryngologists, among other healthcare specialists, frequently use instruments that surpass safety limits, rendering them more susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss. This condition detrimentally impacts communication, performance, healthcare personnel well-being, and patient safety. This study aims to assess whether otolaryngologists and other operating room staff face a higher risk of hearing loss compared to their peers in non-surgical fields, particularly considering advances in surgical instrumentation. A case-control study conducted at King Saud University Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with the Otolaryngology and Audiology departments from June 2021 to December 2023. Comprehensive medical histories, physical measurements, and various audiological tests, including tympanometry, standard pure-tone audiometry, extended high-frequency pure-tone audiometry, and distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOM), were administered to ensure precise results. The study included 20 otolaryngologists of varying ages and experience levels (n = 20) and a comparison group of 20 apparently healthy non-otolaryngologist medical professionals. Both groups were drawn from the same population and matched for age, socioeconomic factors, and environments. All subjects underwent extensive audiological testing for result accuracy. The mean age of otolaryngologists was 31 ± 11 years with a balanced gender distribution. In contrast, the mean age of the non-otolaryngologist group was 32 ± 10 years, with a male predominance. Otolaryngologists exhibited higher odds of low-frequency hearing loss. Additionally, most otolaryngologists displayed the absence of DPOM at 8 kHz, 9 kHz, and 10 kHz, whereas in non-otolaryngologists, DPOM was predominantly present. This study provides objective evidence of varying hearing levels among otolaryngologists and their peers in different specialties. Preventive measures should be implemented to mitigate communication challenges and enhance patient safety.",

We aim to depict the prognostic characteristics of cognition, neuroimaging, and pathology biomarkers, as well as the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia for MCI reverters. A total of 796 non-demented participants (mean age = 73.3 years, female = 54.4%, MCI = 55.7%), who were divided into MCI reverters (n = 109), stable MCI (n = 334), and stable NC (n = 353) based on 2-year diagnosis changes, were subsequently followed up for 6 years. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to assess the AD dementia hazard. Linear mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the differences in changing rates of cognitive scores, brain volumes, brain metabolism, and AD biomarkers among three groups. The 2-year MCI reversion rate was 18.17%. MCI reversion was associated with an 89.6% lower risk of AD dementia (HR = 0.104, 95% confidence interval = [0.033, 0.335], p < 0.001) than stable MCI. No significant difference in incident AD risk was found between MCI reverters and stable NC (p = 0.533). Compared to stable MCI, reverters exhibited slower decreases in cognitive performance (false discovery rate corrected p value [FDR-Q] < 0.050), brain volumes (FDR-Q < 0.050), brain metabolism (FDR-Q < 0.001), and levels of cerebrospinal fluid β-amyloid  (FDR-Q = 0.008). The above-mentioned differences were not found between MCI reverters and stable NC (FDR-Q > 0.050). Reversion from MCI to NC predicts a favorable prognosis of pathological, neurodegenerative, and cognitive trajectory.",

  "abstract": "Health care costs and wait times for colorectal cancer treatment are increasing in Canada, but the association between the 2 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between wait times and health care costs and utilization. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study. This study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014 were sorted and ranked into quintiles based on the time from index contact for a colorectal cancer-related symptom to first treatment. The primary outcome is risk-adjusted health care costs, and the secondary outcomes include health care utilization and overall mortality. We included a total of 6936 patients. Total wait times ranged between 0 and 762 days. In comparison with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly increased costs (short: mean cost ratio 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32; moderate: mean cost ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; long: mean cost ratio 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.64; and very long: mean cost ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Compared with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly lower risk of mortality (short: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; moderate: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80; long: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; very long: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85). The median number of pretreatment radiological and endoscopic investigations and surgeon clinic visits increased over the study period across all wait time categories. This is a nonrandomized, retrospective cohort study with potentially limited generalizability. Patients with very short and short wait times are likely those diagnosed with life-threatening complications of colorectal cancer. Outside this window, patients with longer wait times experience increased health care costs and utilization with similar overall mortality. Improved care coordination and patient navigation may help contain the increasing wait times and associated increasing health care costs and utilization.

  "abstract": "Leukoplakia, a common type of oral dysplasia, is simply defined as a white patch in the mouth or other mucosal surface. Oral dysplasia is the most common premalignancy in the oral cavity and yet it is insufficiently researched and thus both diagnosing and treating oral dysplasia are still problematic issues. This study focuses on the immune signature of oral dysplasia and explores whether stimulating the immune system with an immune therapy, vidutolimod (± immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)), can prevent the progression of oral dysplasia or even cause regression. Vidutolimod, a virus-like particle encapsulating G10, is believed to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) through the activation of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). To investigate this, an established murine model for inducing oral cancer was used to study oral dysplasia development and response to in situ injection of vidutolimod at the premalignant phase. The effect of treatment was analyzed histologically and immunologically. ELISA revealed significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-12, and TNF-α in the sera of mice after 24 h of one treatment with vidutolimod + ICB as well as increased levels of proliferating T cells and pDCs in draining lymph nodes 72 h after the third and final treatment, thus indicating the immune-boosting effect of this therapy. Vidutolimod + ICB caused a significant decrease in Ki-67 expression by epithelial cells in the lesion area compared to untreated mice, implicating that this treatment regime may prevent lesion progression.",

There is a need to find miRNAs and other target genes to reduce mortality rates. The current study aims to find potential miRNAs and target genes among MI patients, MI patients with pre-diabetes (metformin non-users), and MI patients with diabetes (metformin users).MethodThe candidate miRNAs were identified by microarray profiling, and their differential expression was evaluated through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in control and patient groups. The potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a were retrieved from the TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRDB databases. The sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.ResultsMicroarray profiling identified 16 miRNAs with significantly altered expression in all MI patient groups compared with healthy controls. According to this data, two miR-1 and miR-133a (with a high ratio) were selected for further verification. All patient groups exhibited a significant increase in the expression levels of miR-1 and miR-133a. Also, miR-1 and miR-133a levels were lower in metformin-user patients than in non-user patients (  < 0.05). Moreover, interleukins, growth factors, and other related genes were identified as potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) was 0.973 (95% CI: 0.718-0.884) for circulating miR-1, and 0.969 (95% CI: 0.723-0.876) for miR-133a in patients with diabetes (  < 0.001).ConclusionPrediction of miRNA profiles and network of target genes are valuable in the early diagnosis of MI in individuals without and with diabetes. Metformin treatment is associated with lower expression of MI-related miRNAs, suggesting a potential mechanism for cardiac protection by this agent.",

  "abstract": "Data on the proportion of patients liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and the prognosis of those who have undergone IMV are limited. Objective data on prognosis are important when discussing preference for IMV. Therefore, this study explored both the proportion of liberation and prognosis after IMV in older patients in Japan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using claim data from April 2014 to March 2019 from the National Health Insurance, Late Elders' Health Insurance, and Long-Term Care Insurance in Tsukuba City, Japan. Patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent IMV were included, and patients who died within 3 days after intubation were excluded. A descriptive analysis of the liberation and the discharge status on day 180 was conducted including a stratification by age categories and care level (CL) < 3 or ≥ 3. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test was conducted to assess whether liberation and discharge status differed among age categories or CLs. In total, 272 patients were included in the study, and the median age was 78 years (interquartile range: 73-84). The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 9.0 days. Pneumonia was the most frequent main diagnosis (12.5%). In total, 73.5% achieved liberation and 42.6% were discharged alive until day 180, while 19.9% were hospitalized and 37.5% were deceased on day 180. The proportion of liberation did not differ among age categories and CLs. However, the IMV duration for those requiring CL ≥ 3 was longer, and the proportion of hospitalized patients on day 180 among patients requiring CL ≥ 3 was significantly higher than that in patients requiring CL < 3 (35.1% vs 17.4%, p = 0.012). This study shows that many older patients can be successfully liberated from IMV. However, one third of patients died in the hospital and one fifth of patients required prolonged hospitalization. IMV and hospitalization were likely to be longer among patients requiring CL ≥ 3. Therefore, it may be important to discuss not only the potential difficulty of liberation, but also to convey the risks of undesired outcomes and physical function decline when considering IMV.",

  "abstract": "Early detection of postoperative recurrence is beneficial for patients with cancer; however, optimal surveillance remains an issue. To optimize the follow-up plan, the estimation of an individual patient's risk of recurrence is indispensable. This study aimed to establish a statistical model for predicting the risk of organ-specific recurrence after curative resection of colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral hospital. This study included 1720 patients with colon cancer treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical charts. The risk score was developed using a competing risk model in a derivation cohort (973 patients treated in 1997-2009) and then validated in a validation cohort (747 patients treated in 2010-2015). Patients who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon cancer were included. The prediction of the incidence of postoperative liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer was measured. The factors selected for the prediction model for liver metastasis included differentiation, T category, venous invasion, N category, and preoperative CEA level. The model for lung metastasis included sex, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, N category, preoperative CEA level, and malignant bowel obstruction. During external validation, the area under the curve at 60 months was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for liver metastasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.81) for lung metastasis. The generalizability of the model to different healthcare settings remains to be elucidated. We developed a prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence in the liver and lung after curative resection of colon cancer, which demonstrated good discrimination ability in the external validation cohort. Our model can aid clinicians and patients in customizing postoperative surveillance according to an individual patient's risk of organ-specific recurrence.

  "abstract": "NAG-1/GDF15, a tumor suppressor, is synthesized as a pro-form in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and undergoes cleavage to generate its mature form. While the biological function of pro-NAG-1/GDF15 remains unclear, our study reveals its crucial role in suppressing oncogenic signaling. We demonstrate that pro-NAG-1/GDF15 is predominantly retained within cells, whereas its mature form is secreted into the media. The expression of NAG-1/GDF15, or uncleavable R193A mutant, inhibits β-catenin and NF-κB signaling, key pathways in CRC progression. Mechanistically, the pro-NAG-1/GDF15 interacts with EpCAM, preventing its cleavage and nuclear translocation, thereby reducing β-catenin and NF-κB activity. This inhibition correlates with decreased expression of oncogenic targets such as cyclin D1 and c-myc. In vivo, NAG-1/GDF15 expression significantly reduces tumor growth in cancer xenograft models, accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, analysis of public datasets suggests that high NAG-1/GDF15 expression is associated with improved CRC patient survival. These findings highlight NAG-1/GDF15 via the formation of pro-NAG-1/GDF15 as a promising therapeutic target for cancer, with potential applications in modulating tumorigenic signaling pathways.",

  "abstract": "To assess the associations between cerebral vessels morphological features, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and the one-year risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. A total of 677 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke from January 2018 to April 2021 were consecutively enrolled. Head computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance imaging including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), were obtained on admission. Cerebral vessels morphological features such as volume, length, radius, density, tortuosity, branch complexity, and degree of stenosis were extracted and calculated using CTA data. Additionally, automated segmentation was employed for delineating WMHs lesions based on FLAIR images. By incorporating clinical characteristics, six predictive models were developed using Cox proportional hazards analysis to estimate the one-year risk of stroke recurrence. The performance of these models was evaluated by comparing the concordance index (C-index). The study found significant associations between the lack of antiplatelet therapy at discharge, reduced length and branching of cerebral vessels, and increased burden of WMHs, with a higher one-year risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (all P < 0.05). The integrated model demonstrated superior prognostic capability (C-index: 0.750; 95% CI: 0.684-0.817), outperforming models based solely on clinical characteristics (C-index: 0.636; 95% CI: 0.555-0.717), cerebral vessels morphology (C-index: 0.601; 95% CI: 0.526-0.676), and WMHs burden (C-index: 0.680; 95% CI: 0.603-0.757). The quantitative assessment of cerebral vessels morphological features and WMHs provides a promising neuroimaging tool for estimating the one-year risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. The incorporation of cerebral vessels morphological features enhances the predictive accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Biopsies are routinely obtained in the workup of large colorectal polyps before endoscopic resection. This study aimed to examine how reliable biopsies are in terms of reflecting the true histopathology of large colorectal polyps, in the clinical routine. This is a retrospective study. Data from patients undergoing polypectomy of large colorectal polyps at the endoscopy unit, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, between January 2014 and December 2016 were scrutinized. A total of 485 colorectal lesions were biopsied within 1 year before complete endoscopic removal. Biopsy-obtained specimens were compared with completely resected specimens in terms of concordance and discordance and if the final result was upgraded or downgraded. The primary outcome measured was the concordance between biopsy-obtained specimens and completely resected specimens. Median lesion size was 3 cm (range 1-11). In 189 cases (39%), biopsies did not provide a correct dysplastic grade compared with final pathology after complete resection. One hundred forty-three cases (29%) and 46 cases (9%) were upgraded and downgraded. The percentage of cases with discordant biopsy results was 40% in cases with 1 biopsy taken and 38% in cases where multiple biopsies had been sampled. Time from biopsy to complete resection did not influence the erroneous outcome of biopsies. Notably, the percentage of discordant biopsy results was 37% and 35% in lesions measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm. However, this percentage increased to 48% in colorectal lesions larger than 4 cm. This study was designed to reflect the clinical routine, the number of biopsies obtained and forceps technique were hence not standardized, which constitutes a limitation. This study demonstrates that cancer-negative forceps biopsies of large colorectal polyps, referred for endoscopic resection, are not reliable. Considering that endoscopic resection of lesions containing superficial cancer is plausible, the clinical value of forceps biopsies in lesions suitable for endoscopic resection is questionable.

LAS BIOPSIAS CON FÓRCEPS NO SON CONFIABLES EN EL ESTUDIO DE LAS LESIONES COLORRECTALES GRANDES REFERIDAS PARA RESECCIÓN ENDOSCÓPICA: ¿DEBERÍAN ABANDONARSE?: Las biopsias se obtienen de forma rutinaria en el estudio de pólipos colorrectales grandes previo a resección endoscópica. Analizar que tan confiables son las biopsias en cuanto a reflejar la verdadera histopatología de los pólipos colorrectales grandes, en la rutina clínica. DISEÑO:: Este es un estudio retrospectivo. Los datos de pacientes sometidos a polipectomía de pólipos colorrectales grandes en la unidad de endoscopia, en Skåne University Hospital Malmö, entre enero de 2014 y diciembre de 2016 fueron examinados. Un total de 485 lesiones colorrectales se biopsiaron dentro de un año antes de la resección endoscópica completa. Las muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia se compararon con las muestras completas resecadas en términos de concordancia y discordancia, y si el resultado final ascendió o disminuyó de categoría. Concordancia entre muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia y muestras completamente resecadas. La mediana de tamaño de lesiones fue de 3 cm (rango 1-11). En 189 casos (39%) las biopsias no proporcionaron un grado de displasia correcto en comparación con la patología final después de la resección completa. 143 casos (29%) y 46 casos (9%) ascendieron y descendieron de categoría, respectivamente. El porcentaje de casos con resultados de biopsia discordantes fue del 40% en los casos con una sola biopsia tomada y del 38% en los casos en los que se tomaron múltiples biopsias. El tiempo desde la biopsia hasta la resección completa no influyó en el resultado erróneo de las biopsias. Notablemente, el porcentaje de resultados de biopsia discordantes fue de 37% y 35% en lesiones que midieron 1-2 cm y 2-4 cm, respectivamente. Sin embargo, este porcentaje aumentó a 48% en lesiones colorrectales mayores de 4 cm. Este estudio se diseñó para reflejar la rutina clínica, el número de biopsias obtenidas y la técnica de fórceps no fueron estandarizadas, lo que constituye una limitación. Este estudio demuestra que las biopsias con fórceps negativas a cáncer, de pólipos colorrectales grandes referidas para resección endoscópica, no son confiables. Teniendo en cuenta que la resección endoscópica de lesiones que contienen cáncer superficial es posible, el valor clínico de las biopsias con fórceps en lesiones aptas para la resección endoscópica es cuestionable.

  "abstract": "Desmoplastic reaction is recognized as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

Sin embargo, su importancia en el cáncer rectal localmente avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia neoadyuvante sigue sin explorarse.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronóstico de la reacción desmoplásica en muestras de pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado después de la quimiorradioterapia.DISEÑO:Este es un estudio retrospectivo.ESCENARIO:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un solo centro oncológico integral.PACIENTES:El estudio incluyó a 255 pacientes con cáncer rectal avanzado que se sometieron a quimiorradioterapia basada en fluoropirimidina seguida de una escisión mesorrectal total entre 2005 y 2014. La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó en categorías madura, intermedia e inmadura según el análisis histológico.RESULTADOS PRINCIPALES:Los resultados primarios fueron la supervivencia sin recurrencia y la supervivencia general. RESULTADOS: La reacción desmoplásica se clasificó como madura (69,0%), intermedia (5,5%) o inmadura (25,5%). El grupo maduro tuvo un mayor porcentaje de buenos respondedores (34,1%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (0%) e inmaduro (4,6%) (p < 0,0001). El grupo maduro se correlacionó con mejores resultados, con una mayor supervivencia libre de recurrencia a 5 años (85,4%) y supervivencia general (93,0%) en comparación con los grupos intermedio (45,1% y 76,2%, respectivamente) e inmaduro (65,8% y 88,8%, respectivamente). En el análisis multivariable, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció significativamente con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia ( p = 0,03). Entre los malos respondedores, la reacción desmoplásica intermedia/inmadura se asoció con una peor supervivencia libre de recurrencia (p = 0,03). La quimioterapia adyuvante no mejoró significativamente la tasa de supervivencia sin recurrencia a 5 años para el grupo maduro (quimioterapia adyuvante vs. ninguna quimioterapia, 86,4% vs. 84,8%; p = 0,64), observándose tendencias peores en el grupo combinado intermedio/inmaduro (55,9% vs. 69,4%, respectivamente, p = 0,27).LIMITACIONES:Las limitaciones incluyen la naturaleza subjetiva de la evaluación de la reacción desmoplásica y el diseño retrospectivo del estudio.CONCLUSIONES:La reacción desmoplásica en muestras quirúrgicas después de la quimiorradioterapia se asocia con respuestas a la quimiorradioterapia y sirve como un factor pronóstico significativo en el cáncer rectal avanzado, particularmente para aquellos que responden mal a la quimiorradioterapia.

  "abstract": "Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a prevalent knee condition in physically active individuals, with a multifactorial etiology. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of lumbopelvic stabilization in treating patients with PFPS. The study involved 28 PFPS patients and 28 healthy controls, all aged between 18 and 45 years. Sociodemographic data were collected, and measurements were taken using ultrasonography (USG) to assess muscle thickness of the transverse abdominis (TrA) and multifidus lumborum (ML), as well as static and dynamic endurance of the trunk muscles in both groups. Pain levels were evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and knee function was assessed using the Kujala Patellofemoral Rating Questionnaire (KPSQ). The TrA and ML muscle thicknesses were symmetrical and statistically similar in both the PFPS and control groups at rest and during contraction (p > 0.05). However, significant differences were found between the muscle thicknesses of the PFPS and control groups for both the right (p < 0.01) and left sides (p < 0.01), both at rest and during contraction. Additionally, significant differences were observed in the dynamic and static trunk endurance tests between the PFPS and control groups (p < 0.001). Pain levels and knee functionality also differed significantly between the two groups (p < 0.001). The findings of this study indicate that individuals with PFPS exhibited differences in the thickness of the TrA and ML muscles compared to asymptomatic controls, suggesting potential lumbopelvic involvement in PFPS pathology.",

  "abstract": "Numerous techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been described. The present study aims to determine the proportion of wrists with CTS in which the application of DN avoids surgery. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial clinical trial was performed. Eighty-six wrists with diagnosis of mild or moderate CTS and indication for surgery were recruited from a hospital traumatology service. The intervention group was treated with DN, with a frequency of one session/week over six weeks, while the control group did not follow any specific treatment, remaining on the waiting list for the surgery. The main variable was the recommendation for surgery. Other secondary variables included changes in electromyography and ultrasound; intensity of pain; Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ); hand dynamometries; and possible adverse effects. The wrists treated by DN had a reduced risk of needing surgery at 12 weeks by 62% compared to the control group (RR = 0.38, 95% CI[0.2-0.72]), with this value being significant (p-value = 0.003). This group also obtained a significant improvement in the intensity of pain (p-value = 0.006), and in the BCTQ-severity of syntoms scale and BCTQ-functional situation scale (p-value = 0.039 and p-value = 0.019 respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in the dynamometries performed, nor in the results of the electromyography and ultrasound studies. Adverse effects were infrequent or unimportant. Application of DN to wrists with mild or moderate CTS reduces the need for surgery, and improves the clinical symptoms and functionality of the hand.",

  "abstract": "ObjectivePatients with diabetes are 3-5 times higher at risk for cardiovascular diseases and myocardial infarction (MI). There is a need to find miRNAs and other target genes to reduce mortality rates. The current study aims to find potential miRNAs and target genes among MI patients, MI patients with pre-diabetes (metformin non-users), and MI patients with diabetes (metformin users).MethodThe candidate miRNAs were identified by microarray profiling, and their differential expression was evaluated through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in control and patient groups. The potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a were retrieved from the TargetScan, miRWalk, and miRDB databases. The sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses.ResultsMicroarray profiling identified 16 miRNAs with significantly altered expression in all MI patient groups compared with healthy controls. According to this data, two miR-1 and miR-133a (with a high ratio) were selected for further verification. All patient groups exhibited a significant increase in the expression levels of miR-1 and miR-133a. Also, miR-1 and miR-133a levels were lower in metformin-user patients than in non-user patients (  < 0.05). Moreover, interleukins, growth factors, and other related genes were identified as potential targets for miR-1 and miR-133a. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) was 0.973 (95% CI: 0.718-0.884) for circulating miR-1, and 0.969 (95% CI: 0.723-0.876) for miR-133a in patients with diabetes (  < 0.001).ConclusionPrediction of miRNA profiles and network of target genes are valuable in the early diagnosis of MI in individuals without and with diabetes. Metformin treatment is associated with lower expression of MI-related miRNAs, suggesting a potential mechanism for cardiac protection by this agent.",

  "abstract": "Emerging trials demonstrate that neuromodulation, especially spinal cord stimulation, improves function for those with chronic spinal cord injury. Their design - uncontrolled and unblinded - is justified by the claim that sham conditions are unethical and/or impossible. In the absence of controlled trials, the functional benefits of spinal cord stimulation cannot be distinguished from the effects of placebo. To discuss the validity of the claim that placebo control conditions are infeasible in spinal cord stimulation research, and to propose feasible solutions for including sham conditions that would account for placebo effects. Placebo effects are likely to occur in spinal cord stimulation studies, given the high levels of participant expectations of an effect, natural fluctuations in symptoms associated with spinal cord injury, regression towards the mean, the Hawthorne effect, presence of concurrent interventions, and the absence of blinding in existing studies. Options for placebo control conditions could include adding an \"untreated\" control group, using \"placebo-resistant\" outcomes, adding an active comparator group or sham stimulation, or investing in parasthesia-free stimulation. Additionally, wherever feasible, blinding of both participants and assessors should be pursued. The current evidence base for spinal cord stimulation is undermined by the lack of rigorous sham controls, and the argument that such controls are unethical or unfeasible do not withstand scrutiny. We propose strategies for the inclusion of placebo controls in future trials and encourage investigators to prioritize these approaches to ensure the true benefit of spinal cord stimulation can be determined.",

  "abstract": "Although it is well-documented that robotic-assisted total knee arthroplasty (TKA) can improve surgical precision, evaluations of the postoperative kinematics of patients implanted using robotics remain less common. The objective of this study is to analyze the weight-bearing kinematics for multiple TKAs implanted using two different surgical robots. In vivo knee kinematics were assessed using fluoroscopy for 28 subjects implanted with a Bi-Cruciate Stabilized (BCS) TKA, 23 with a Bi-Cruciate Retaining (BCR) TKA, 13 with a posterior stabilized (PS) TKA, and 22 with a cruciate retaining (CR) TKA. All subjects were implanted by the same surgeon using the respective company's surgical robot. All subjects performed a weight-bearing deep knee bend. Parameters of interest include the femoral condylar anterior/posterior motion, femorotibial axial rotation, and weight-bearing range-of-motion. The BCS TKA experienced the most posterior rollback, 13.4 ± 4.4 mm for the lateral condyle and 5.8 ± 2.5 mm for the medial condyle. These subjects also experienced the most femorotibial axial rotation, +9.3 ± 5.3°. Conversely, CR subjects experienced the least overall rollback and most anterior sliding, 0.4 ± 3.8 mm of lateral rollback and 1.9 ± 4.1 mm of medial anterior sliding. Implant design appears to play a significant role in postoperative kinematics. Improved stability is evident in TKAs that account for the ACL. However, no system behaved significantly better nor worse than previously published literature evaluating standard instrumentation. Level of Evidence: Level 3, retrospective cohort study.",

A multiple-threshold meta-analysis and standard bivariate meta-analysis were used. This meta-analysis included 14 studies comprising 25 528 follicles. Results showed follicle size is predictive for oocyte developmental competence, including oocyte maturity (area under the receiver operation characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.66-0.77; n = 24 116; follicle size ≥ 15 mm), normal fertilisation (0.62, 0.55-0.69; n = 25 321; follicle size ≥ 16 mm), blastocyst formation (0.61, 0.53-0.69; n = 12 859; follicle size ≥ 15 mm) and good-quality embryo (0.64, 0.54-0.71; n = 16 631; follicle size ≥ 16 mm) per oocyte. Based on per mature oocyte or two-pronuclei zygote, follicle size showed little predictive capacity for embryological parameters. Follicle size could predict oocyte developmental competence with corresponding optimal thresholds identified. However, the benefits for embryological fate may plateau at follicle sizes ≥ 15-16 mm once the oocytes achieve maturation or fertilisation.",

  "abstract": "The mechanism of the lipid paradox remains uncertain, and malnutrition may be 1 explanation. In this prospective cohort study, we explored the associations between baseline remnant cholesterol (RC) concentrations and clinical outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke, stratified by nutritional status. Patients with ischemic stroke in a single-center prospective cohort (Shanghai, China) from January 2018 to December 2022 were studied. Individuals were classified into 3 groups based on their Controlling Nutritional Status score. Poor outcome and all-cause mortality during up to 3 months of follow-up were compared among patients with varied nutritional status and RC levels utilizing multivariate logistic regression analyses, RC splines, and subgroup analyses. A total of 6892 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the cohort, of which 5257 patients were included in the present study (without malnutrition: 2418 [46.0%]; mild malnutrition: 2516 [47.9%]; moderate-severe malnutrition: 323 [6.1%]). The median age was 69±12 years, and 3398 (64.6%) were male. Patients with moderate-severe malnutrition had the highest risks of poor outcome (198 [61.3%];  <0.001) and all-cause mortality (106 [32.8%];  <0.001) during the 3-month follow-up. A higher baseline RC level was an independent protective factor for adverse outcomes in patients with any degree of malnutrition ( <0.05), which was not observed in patients without malnutrition. In addition, compared with the moderate-severely malnourished with RC <0.471 mmol/L, the adjusted odds ratios for poor outcome and all-cause mortality were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.450-1.438) and 0.898 (0.502-1.607) for participants with 0.471 to 0.632 mmol/L, 0.259 (0.095-0.704) and 0.222 (0.061-0.810) for 0.633 to 0.868 mmol/L, and 0.160 (0.037-0.689) and 0.202 (0.042-0.967) for ≥0.869 mmol/L, respectively. The lipid paradox was only observed in the malnourished patients with ischemic stroke. Strict lipid reduction therapy is still recommended for patients without malnutrition.

This study aims to assess the frequency of new hip problems, including pain and HD progression, as well as the need for additional hip surgery following scoliosis correction in neuromuscular patients, and to identify predictive factors for these issues. This retrospective study included 71 neuromuscular patients (142 hips) who underwent posterior spinal fusion (PSF) at a specialized center between 2015 and 2022. Clinical data such as age, sex, underlying pathology, ambulatory status, and prior hip surgeries were collected. Radiological parameters, including curve characteristics, coronal imbalance, Cobb angle, pelvic obliquity (PO), and migration percentage (MP), were measured pre- and post-operatively. Descriptive, comparative, and multivariate analyses, including logistic regression, were performed to identify significant predictors and determine optimal cutoff points. The mean age of patients was 15 ± 2 years, with 59% female and 84.5% nonambulatory. After scoliosis surgery, 15.5% of hips developed new hip problems: 20 hips experienced pain and 9 had HD progression, with 7 requiring additional surgery (3 reconstructive and 4 palliative). Factors including a preoperative up-hip and increased MP, with a cutoff > 25%, were strong predictors of hip pain. HD progression was linked to a postoperative up-hip and increased MP, with MP > 60% emerging as a critical predictor. The need for additional hip surgery was associated with cerebral palsy (CP) and with increased MP. Approximately 1 in 7 hips developed new-onset problems following PSF in neuromuscular patients. Factors including a preoperative up-hip and increased MP were significant predictors of adverse outcomes, underscoring the importance of thorough preoperative assessment, personalized surgical planning, and proactive counseling regarding potential postoperative complications.

Most clinical practice guidelines from medical professional societies do not recommend routine PGx testing, with a few key exceptions. Inconsistent recommendations across clinical practice guidelines, FDA product labeling, and payer reimbursement policies have hampered widespread adoption of testing. Multiple resources exist to aid in the adoption and use of actionable PGx test results in clinical practice; however, most of these resources do not provide guidance on who should receive PGx testing and when-a critical question the clinical community continues to struggle with. There are multiple considerations when answering this question beyond the clinical validity of the drug-gene interaction itself, such as the actionable result frequency, severity of the adverse clinical outcome, predictive power of the PGx test, suitability of alternative treatments, cost, and turnaround time of test results. This perspective discusses these considerations and models for testing including preemptive screening, pretreatment testing, and reactive testing, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The authors provide their perspectives on identifying candidates for PGx testing in the current real-world environment and how that differs from a clinically ideal scenario.",

  "abstract": "Vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia globally after Alzheimer's disease, is associated with neuroinflammation. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an important pattern recognition receptor in human innate immunity, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. The NLRP3 inflammasome pathway destroys neuronal cells primarily through the production of IL-18 and IL-1β. Moreover, it exacerbates vascular dementia by producing IL-18, IL-1β, and the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD, which also contributes to neuronal cell death. Thus, blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway presents a new therapeutic strategy for treating vascular dementia, thereby delaying or curing the disease more effectively and mitigating adverse effects. This review explores the role and mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vascular dementia, summarizing current research and therapeutic strategies. Investigating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can reveal the pathogenesis of vascular dementia from a new perspective and propose innovative preventive and treatment strategies.",

When a fracture of the acromion occurs, despite being rare, matching the best-fit fixation plate is challenging due to few options and limited availability of fixation plate types. Alternative fixation methods can carry risk of nonunion complications. The objective of this study was to investigate the morphological curvature pattern of the acromion to assess the level of the fixation plates fitness and provide the suitable imaging modalities for evaluating the acromion curvature. The correlation between the acromion curvature and five fixation plates were calculated and their fitness level was evaluated statistically. The curvature of acromion and the five available fixation plates were photographed and assessed digitally by software (FIJI ImageJ and Microsoft Excel). The method entails plotting seven points along the curving surface and margins of the acromion, while the Excel Solver function calculates the regression, ultimately giving curvature values. First, the acromion parameters were studied on 180 paired healthy dry scapulae. Then, the acromion curvature values were compared to the fixation plates curvatures. Likewise, the acromion curvature was assessed as applicable on 153 (100 AP- views, 50 Y- views, and 3 superior-views) retrospective plain X-rays and 40 3D-CT scapula reconstructions of healthy acromia. The mean length of the acromion was 48.70 ± 5.29mm, mean thickness was 8.51 ± 1.67mm, and mean width was 25.97 ± 5.97mm. The calculated values of the mean curvatures were 0.050 ± 0.015mm  for the mean acromion surface, 0.042 ± 0.027mm  for the internal margin, and 0.055 ± 0.010mm  for the external margin. The curved geometry of the acromion was plotted on a graph giving a spectrum of curvature patterns with distribution values revealing fixation plates fitness represented by area under the curve with frequencies of 4.32% for the acromion-specific fixation plate, 14.28% for the large clavicle fixation plate, 0.26% for the small clavicle fixation plate, 53.38% for the flexible universal fixation plate, and none for the rigid universal fixation plate. Approximately 27.76% of the acromion surface curvatures distribution does not overlap with any of our measured fixation plates. Evaluating the acromion surface curvature was possible on plain X-rays in the Y-view only.",

  "abstract": "Genetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients are usually conducted in small or regional studies; there is currently a lack of research on whether genetic abnormalities in each continent have regional specificity. In this study, we collected and jointly analysed studies published between 1995 and 2023 that reported on molecular and cytogenetic abnormalities of AML patients. Our findings reveal that the incidence of molecular genetic abnormalities has been increasing annually, whereas cellular genetic abnormalities show an overall declining trend. We performed cluster analysis and developed a prognostic risk model to uncover that AML patients with molecular genetic abnormalities, or both types of genetic abnormalities, have a relatively lower risk in Europe. In contrast, AML patients in Asia with cytogenetic abnormalities exhibit a comparatively lower risk. We also found that spliceosome co-mutations were dominant among molecular genetic abnormalities, but the synergistic correlation between cytogenetic abnormalities is minimal. Our study offers valuable insights in AML risk levels across different regions, based on prognostic classification and regional risk stratification, and underscores the clinical significance of gene mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and their co-occurrence, highlighting their role in understanding the disease's pathogenesis and informing treatment strategies.",

  "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis can occur due to many traumatic and nontraumatic causes. Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in new type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of rhabdomyolysis on mortality and renal outcomes in patients hospitalized in our hospital's COVID-19 wards. In our single-center and retrospective study, we included patients who were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19 by a thorax-computed tomography finding who were older than 18 years of age and with a measured creatinine kinase (CK) > 1000 U/L on any day of hospitalization. The same number of patients hospitalized in COVID-19 services with CK < 1000 U/L and with similar gender and age were determined as the control group. We analyzed the data of 2065 patients, and compared 154 patients in the rhabdomyolysis group (group 1) and 154 patients in the control group (group 2). Acute kidney injury (AKI) (44.2% vs 21.4%; P < .001), intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (53.2% vs 13.6%; P < .001), intubation (75.6% vs 23.8%; P < .001), mortality (36.4% vs 3.2%; P < .001) and the need for dialysis (3.9% vs 0.6%; P = .005) were seen more in the rhabdomyolysis group. When that group was divided into the early rhabdomyolysis group (group 1a), where the CK value reached its highest value in ≤3 days, and the late rhabdomyolysis group (group 1b), where it was ≥ 4 days, AKI (29.7% vs 65.1%; P < .001), ICU (35.2% vs 79.4%; P < .001), intubation (56.2% vs 88%; P = .001), mortality (18% vs 61.9%; P < .001), and dialysis (1.1% vs 7.9%; P = .031), the results were higher in the group 1b. The available data suggest that rhabdomyolysis seen in COVID-19 patients is not a direct predictor of mortality and poor renal outcomes, but is a secondary outcome to multiple-organ failure caused by worsening clinical status.",

However, mechanical tumor ablation requires highly intense FUS pulses, which may generate off-target effects. In addition, residual cancer cells that survive ablation can cause recurrence. To overcome these challenges, we developed a dual-functional nanomaterial by assembling peptide amphiphiles on hydrophobically modified nanoparticles. The hydrophobic nanoparticle core allows for the generation of cavitating bubbles at low FUS intensities to effectively ablate tumors. Peptide amphiphile shells interact dynamically with the hydrophobic nanoparticle surfaces and cell membranes, which improved tumor retention and cellular internalization of payloads attached to them. By conjugating a highly potent agent, Monomethyl auristatin E, to the peptide amphiphiles, we showed synergistic mechano- and chemotherapy using   and   models of human melanoma.

This study explores associations of artificial intelligence (AI)-based skeletal muscle assessment with hematologic toxicity and chemotherapy relative dose intensity (RDI) in adults with mCRC receiving standard combination chemotherapy.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of adults with mCRC receiving first-line FOLFOX or FOLFIRI over 6 months (≤12 cycles) from 1/2011 to 11/2018. We used a validated AI-based skeletal muscle assessment on baseline (prior to starting chemotherapy) computed tomography scans to determine skeletal muscle index (SMI, cm /m ), categorizing low SMI using independent sex-specific cut-off values. We sought to evaluate the association between low SMI and the incidence of grade ≥3 (G ≥ 3) cytopenia over 6 months. Secondary endpoints included time to G ≥ 3 cytopenia and RDI.ResultsOverall, 126 adults met inclusion (median age = 61 years [range, 29-85]; 56 [44%] female) with a median BMI of 26.6 kg/m  (IQR, 24.1-30.5 kg/m ), including 59 (47%) with a low SMI. G ≥ 3 neutropenia incidence was higher in adults with low SMI (31% vs. 15%, p = 0.036). There was no difference for other G ≥ 3 cytopenias (39% vs 24%, p = 0.067) or median time to G ≥ 3 neutropenia (p = 0.053).

Twenty-two patients with AVN underwent core decompression and BMAI. The patients were followed for at least 12 months. Radiological assessments were performed using plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and staging was conducted based on the Association Research Circulation Osseous system. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Harris Hip Score and Merle d'Aubigne-Postel scoring systems. At the 12-month follow-up, hip function scores showed significant improvement. The mean Harris Hip Score increased by 23 points (P < .001), and the mean Merle d'Aubigne-Postel score increased by 1 point (P < .001). Radiologically, all stage I lesions regressed to stage 0 (P < .001). Among stage II lesions, 83% remained stable, while progression was observed in 17%. 75% of the stage IIIA lesions showed radiological progression. Core decompression combined with BMAI effectively halts the progression of early-stage AVN, preserving joint integrity and delaying the need for total hip arthroplasty.

To address these challenges, researchers are exploring alternative approaches such as in vitro models, organoids, and computational simulations, which offer promising and ethical substitutes for animal models. Despite these developments, animal models remain indispensable for certain investigations due to their ability to replicate complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.

  "abstract": "Understanding pathological changes in the brain is essential for guiding treatment decisions in brain injuries and diseases. Despite significant advances in brain imaging techniques, clinical practice still faces challenges due to infrastructure reliance and high resource demands. This review explores the current knowledge on blood-based biomarkers that indicate brain pathology, which can assist in identifying at-risk patients, diagnosing patients, predicting disease progression, and treatment response. We focus on the inherited metabolic disorders X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) which share remarkable phenotypic variability. Disease-specific increases in the lipid metabolites lyso-PC26:0 in X-ALD and sulfatides in MLD might contribute to predicting clinical manifestation. Disease-unspecific biomarkers for axonal damage (neurofilament light chain protein, NfL) and glial degeneration (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) are able to distinguish X-ALD and MLD phenotypes at the group level. The implementation of X-ALD into newborn screening programs in various countries, including several U.S. states, has increased the demand for predictive blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting the early conversion from the pre-symptomatic to the early neuroinflammatory cerebral form of X-ALD. Among different biomarkers, NfL has proven most effective in reflecting neuroinflammation and correlating with brain lesion volume and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based severity scores. We discuss how NfL has moved from initial proof-of-principle towards proof-of-concept studies in brain disorders such as multiple sclerosis and how this knowledge could be applied for the clinical implementation of NfL in rare inherited metabolic disorders such as X-ALD.",

While pharmacological therapies have evolved to mitigate symptoms, they fail to address the core pathology-orexin deficiency. This narrative review examines the potential of orexin cell transplantation as an innovative therapeutic approach to restore orexin signalling and treat the root cause of narcolepsy. We begin by examining the clinical features, pathophysiology, and diagnostic criteria of narcolepsy, focusing on the essential role of orexins in regulating the sleep-wake cycle and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cataplexy. The review then explores experimental therapeutic approaches, including hypothalamic tissue grafts, gene therapy, and immortalised orexin-expressing cell lines, highlighting their potential to address the orexin deficit in narcolepsy. While preclinical studies show that transplanted orexin cells can integrate into host neural networks, enhance sleep stability, and decrease the frequency of cataplexy in animal models, several challenges remain. Immortalised orexin cell lines offer a scalable and consistent option for transplantation therapies. However, immune rejection, long-term cell survival, and complete functional integration persist. These translational hurdles must be addressed to bring these therapies to clinical practice. This review underscores the need for continued research to overcome these barriers and optimise cell-based therapies for narcolepsy.",

EOSQ-SELF was developed to assess HRQoL directly from patients, yet its responsiveness remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties and responsiveness of the cross-culturally adapted traditional Chinese version of EOSQ-SELF. Patients were consecutively recruited at an orthopaedic specialist clinic. Included patients must be diagnosed with EOS, aged 8 to 18 years at recruitment, and could read traditional Chinese. EOSQ-SELF underwent double-forward single-backward translations. At recruitment and at 6-month follow-up, patients completed the traditional Chinese EOSQ-SELF, refined Scoliosis Research Society-22 item (SRS-22r) questionnaire, and EuroQol-5-dimension 5-level. Psychometric properties of the EOSQ-SELF were assessed, with sensitivity analysis via known group comparison. Responsiveness was evaluated through an anchor-based approach using a global rating of change (GRC) scale. A total of 139 patients were recruited, with 132 (92.4% responsiveness) included for analyses. Traditional Chinese EOSQ-SELF has good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent, and construct validity. The EOSQ-SELF total score showed no ceiling/floor effects, correlated with SRS-22r total score (rs: 0.788, P<0.001), EQ index score (rs: 0.680, P<0.001), and EQ VAS (rs: 0.527, P<0.001). Discriminative validity was demonstrated: syndromic EOS had a lower transfer domain score (vs. idiopathic and congenital), and a lower EOSQ-SELF total score (median: 71.3 vs. idiopathic 81.1, P=0.023). On the basis of the GRC, 7.4%, 46.7%, and 45.9% of patients had worsened, unchanged, and improved overall health, respectively. The improvement group showed significantly higher EOSQ-SELF total score at 6 months (median: 83.4 vs. baseline 78.7, P=0.015), and none had total scores decrease reaching MCID. Traditional Chinese EOSQ-SELF is a reliable instrument for assessing HRQoL and its changes reported by older patients (aged 8 years or above﻿). It is sensitive in differentiating patients with improved overall health from those who are stable/worsened. EOSQ-SELF can enhance clinical care and monitoring of EOS patients through assessing their HRQoL and detecting changes effectively. Level II.",

While co-stimulatory signals play critical roles in promoting NK cell proliferation and activating their functions, the exploitation of these signals for expanding NK cells has not been fully explored. To identify the optimal engineered feeder cells for expanding umbilical cord blood-derived NK cells, we generated different feeder cells expressing the co-stimulatory molecules CD80, 4-1BBL, or membrane-bound IL-21 (mbIL21). We then evaluated the transduction efficacy of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) construct into expanded NK cells using various lentiviral vectors. Our results showed that CD80, in combination with 4-1BBL and mbIL21, induced the highest expansion of NK cells from cord blood.

Single-blind, Randomized clinical trial. Outpatient clinic. Sixty patients (19-38 years old) with mechanical neck pain participated in this study and were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the faculty of physical therapy after a referral from an orthopedist. Patients were randomly assigned by the opaque sealed envelope to two treatment groups: Group A Received High power pain threshold ultrasound (HPPTUS), traditional therapy in form of (active range of motion, stretching exercises, and postural correction exercises (PCES), whereas Group B Received traditional therapy only; therapeutic sessions were performed Twice/week for 4 weeks. The visual analog scale, pressure pain threshold, neck disability index, upper trapezius and Levator scapulae median frequency, and root mean square were used to evaluate the patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment status. Multiple pairwise comparisons within each group revealed statistically significant differences in all outcome variables in both groups with favor to the HPPTUS group as p = 0.0001. Between group analysis at post treatment revealed statistical significant difference between both groups in all outcome variables as p = 0.0001.

MCGRs allow noninvasive lengthenings with external lengthening device and reduce the need for surgical procedures. The association of preoperative body mass index (BMI) and the outcomes of the MCGR treatment is not well known. Prospectively collected international database was reviewed for EOS patients treated with MCGR. Patients without preoperative BMI data or follow-up <2 years were excluded. Patients were classified as healthy weight, overweight, and underweight using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts. Quality of life was assessed using EOSQ-24. Results were analyzed from the 2-year follow-up. A total of 663 patients were categorized into underweight (n=91), healthy weight (n=417), and overweight (n=155) groups. There were no significant differences in major curve correction or thoracic height increase among the BMI groups, irrespective of etiology. Distribution of BMI categories differed significantly by etiology (P=0.009), with lower healthy weight proportions in the syndromic group (92/167, 55%) compared with idiopathic (131/177, 74%) (adjusted P=0.004), and a higher underweight proportion in neuromuscular (36/244, 15%) compared with idiopathic (15/177, 8.5%) (adjusted P=0.044).

Implant-related complications were less common in underweight patients compared with overweight patients (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20-0.90). Higher BMI z-score was a significant predictor of implant breakage, whereas preoperative major curve, kyphosis, and etiology were not. EOSQ-24 scores did not differ significantly among BMI groups, and changes in scores were comparable across groups during follow-up. BMI status did not influence curve correction, thoracic height increase, or EOSQ-24 outcomes in early-onset scoliosis patients. However, the higher incidence of implant breakage in overweight patients suggests that elevated BMI should be carefully considered when planning treatment. Level III.",

  "abstract": "The role of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) experienced with low-level viremia (LLV) remains poorly defined. This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic utility of serum HBV RNA as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcomes in this population. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on 117 pediatric patients with LLV (mean age: 13.14 years; 34% female) treated with continuous entecavir (ConT) or modified regimens (switching to or combining with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) for ≥ 120 weeks. Virological response was defined as HBV DNA < 10 IU/mL at week 120. No significant baseline differences existed between ConT and modified regimen groups. Compared to ConT, modified regimens achieved greater reductions in serum HBV DNA, HBV RNA, and quantitative HBsAg, with higher cumulative undetectable rates at week 120 (HBV DNA: ≥ 80.0%; HBV RNA: ≥ 54.8%; P < 0.05). Notably, qHBsAg levels remained elevated in most patients, with only 3 individuals achieving undetectable levels (< 0.05 IU/mL). Multivariate analysis identified higher HBV RNA levels at week 48 as an independent risk factor for non-virological response (adjusted odds ratio: 5.86; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-24.62; P = 0.016). Although HBV RNA alone was less predictive than HBV DNA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.76 vs. 0.80; P = 0.459), combining both markers improved prediction accuracy (AUC: 0.82; P < 0.05 vs. single markers). In children with LLV, serum HBV RNA level is an independent risk factor for non-virological response and may serve as a complementary biomarker to HBV DNA for guiding antiviral therapy adjustments.",

  "abstract": "Numerous techniques for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) have been described. The present study aims to determine the proportion of wrists with CTS in which the application of DN avoids surgery. An assessor-blind randomized clinical trial clinical trial was performed. Eighty-six wrists with diagnosis of mild or moderate CTS and indication for surgery were recruited from a hospital traumatology service. The intervention group was treated with DN, with a frequency of one session/week over six weeks, while the control group did not follow any specific treatment, remaining on the waiting list for the surgery. The main variable was the recommendation for surgery. Other secondary variables included changes in electromyography and ultrasound; intensity of pain; Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ); hand dynamometries; and possible adverse effects. The wrists treated by DN had a reduced risk of needing surgery at 12 weeks by 62% compared to the control group (RR = 0.38, 95% CI[0.2-0.72]), with this value being significant (p-value = 0.003). This group also obtained a significant improvement in the intensity of pain (p-value = 0.006), and in the BCTQ-severity of syntoms scale and BCTQ-functional situation scale (p-value = 0.039 and p-value = 0.019 respectively). Statistical significance was not reached in the dynamometries performed, nor in the results of the electromyography and ultrasound studies. Adverse effects were infrequent or unimportant. Application of DN to wrists with mild or moderate CTS reduces the need for surgery, and improves the clinical symptoms and functionality of the hand.",

  "abstract": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) significantly increase morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) being a leading HAI pathogen requiring targeted eradication in healthcare settings. The growing bacterial tolerance to chemical disinfectants, like chlorhexidine, highlights an urgent need for novel disinfection strategies. Bacteriophages, which employ unique mechanisms to lyse bacteria, offer a potential solution. Combining phages with disinfectants could reduce the use of chemical agents and delay the development of bacterial resistance. However, the use of phages for contamination control in clinical environments remains underexplored. ΦK2046 was isolated from hospital wastewater and characterized by transmission electron microscopy, one-step growth curve, optimal multiplicity of infection, and stability analysis. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify the genomic characteristics of ΦK2046. The antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of ΦK2046 combined with chlorhexidine were assessed through growth curves, time-kill assays, crystal violet staining, and scanning electron microscopy. A contaminated medical device model was established to assess the ΦK2046-chlorhexidine combination's biofilm reduction efficacy, and different dosing sequences and timing intervals were evaluated for their impact on biofilms formed on urinary catheters. ΦK2046, characterized by a short latency period, strong environmental stability, safety, and tolerance to chlorhexidine, significantly enhanced the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of chlorhexidine against FK2046, and reduce the emergence of resistant strains. In contaminated medical device models, the combination of ΦK2046 and chlorhexidine diminished bacterial load and biofilm formation on surfaces. A \"phage-first\" dosing sequence, particularly with a 90-min interval before chlorhexidine treatment, showed superior efficacy in biofilm reduction. This study, using ΦK2046 as an example, demonstrates the potential of phages to enhance the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of chlorhexidine and their feasibility in medical device disinfection. This innovative approach not only improves chlorhexidine's disinfecting power but also effectively tackles the issue of reduced susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to chlorhexidine. The research advances the development and application of phage-based disinfectants and lays a foundation for establishing a phage library with adjuvant properties for disinfectants.",

  "abstract": "Forward neck flexion (FNF) is a common postural abnormality in Parkinson's disease (PD), which disturbs the overall body alignment and can lead to more severe deformities through both central nervous system control and biomechanical compensation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of forward neck muscles related to FNF in individuals with PD, both with and without FNF, in comparison to age-matched individuals with normal posture. Hand-held myotonometry (Myoton Pro®) was conducted to determine the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscles of all thirty participants: individuals with PD and FNF (n = 10), individuals with PD without FNF (n = 10), and normal controls (n = 10). Individuals with PD, both with and without FNF, exhibited higher passive tone and muscle stiffness and lower elasticity, relaxation time, and creep in both muscles, particularly in the sternocleidomastoid, compared to age-matched normal controls. No significant differences in any muscle variables were found between the two PD groups. These findings indicate that the biomechanical and viscoelastic properties of neck muscles are altered even in the presymptomatic stage of postural abnormalities in PD. This may provide potential evidence of underlying peripheral factors that involve postural deformities via proprioceptive disturbances and exacerbate rigidity in PD.",

  "abstract": "Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a hereditary channelopathy that affects cardiac electrical signal transmission, with SCN5A gene mutation being the most common cause. Current BrS therapy primarily relies on Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators, which are limited to arrhythmia prevention. Recent research has explored gene therapy as an alternative approach for managing BrS. Resveratrol, a non-ketone polyphenol compound, exhibits cardioprotective effects due to its antioxidant properties, which can influence gene expression through cellular signaling pathways, thereby modulating adeno-associated virus (AAV). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of resveratrol in enhancing the induction of AAV-based viral vectors as a potential definitive therapy for SCN5A mutations in BrS patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PLOS ONE. The final stage involved assessing the eligibility of 47 studies, followed by a full-text review, which included seven studies for further analysis. The findings indicate that this therapeutic approach highlights resveratrol's crucial role as an activator of deacetylase proteins, influencing DNA repair processes, cell cycle regulation, and energy metabolism. Resveratrol facilitates the modulation of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, enabling calcium ion (Ca ⁺) influx into cardiomyocytes, thereby maintaining normal cardiac rhythm. Resveratrol enhances AAV-mediated gene delivery and expression through p53 pathway activation. Experimental studies have demonstrated that AAV-MOG1 gene therapy can restore sodium channel function, improve cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities, and ameliorate the clinical manifestations of BrS. Thus, resveratrol is potentially an inducer of AAV-mediated gene therapy for BrS.",

  "abstract": "Autologous free flap transplantation is the most economical and effective method for clinical treatment of large-area trauma, but the shortage of flap donors prevents widespread use of this method. Hair follicle stem cells have great potential to repair wounds, but wound repair by hair follicle stem cells has not yet met expectations. We used a wound model of Bama mini-pigs and treated the wound with autologous hair follicles or flaps. The wound healing was observed on days 7, 14, and 21 post-surgery and wound healing rates were analyzed using Image J software. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate re-epithelialization of the wound. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of hair follicle stem cell markers (CK15, Sox9) and explore the mechanism of wound repair. This research found that autologous hair follicles can accelerate wound healing. The efficiency of hair follicles in wound repair is related to their structure. Dermal papilla acts as a biological barrier to hair follicle-mediated wound repair. Dermal papilla removal enhances wound healing efficiency, likely by relieving dermal papilla-imposed restrictions on hair follicle stem cell migration. Autologous hair follicles for wound repair has the advantages of minimal damage, simple fabrication, and abundant source, which may be able to replace the flap transplantation as a therapeutic strategy in the future. This study is helpful to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of hair follicles involved in wound repair, and has important academic and clinical value for solving the problem of shortage flap donor.",

The identification of specific therapeutic targets and the development of efficient delivery systems are essential. In this study, a nanoparticle delivery system targeting necrotic cardiomyocytes was engineered. This system effectively downregulated long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AK156373 and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation during MI progression. Mechanistically, silencing lncRNA AK156373 enhanced the viability and mitochondrial function of hypoxic cardiomyocytes and lowered intracellular inflammatory cytokine levels and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.  , cardiac-specific lncRNA AK15673 knockout mice were generated (AK156373  mice), and lncRNA AK156373 knockout obviously reduced the infarct size, collagen fiber deposition, and ischemia severity in MI mice, leading to improved cardiac function. Additionally, lncRNA AK156373 modulated miR-204-5p to regulate C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) protein expression via the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism, exacerbating myocardial damage and accelerating MI progression. Subsequently, nanoparticles loaded with lncRNA AK156373 siRNA were synthesized. The nanoparticles significantly inhibited MI progression by modulating the miR-204-5p/CXCR2 axis to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation. Overall, these findings establish a key regulatory role for lncRNA AK156373 in MI progression and present a direct preclinical approach for MI therapy.",

However, recent studies have found that thrombotic events triggered by medial arterial calcification (MAC) is the primary cause of chronic limb ischemia below the knee. MAC is localized around the elastic fibers surrounding smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in arteries. Matrix GLA protein (MGP) binds circulating calcium and prevents hydroxyapatite mineral deposition, while also modulating pro-osteogenic signaling by attenuating BMP-2-mediated activation of   gene expression.   mice develop severe MAC and die around 8 weeks after birth due to aortic rupture or heart failure. We previously discovered a rare genetic disease Arterial Calcification due to Deficiency of CD73 (ACDC), in which patients present with extensive MAC in their lower extremity arteries. Using a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell model, we found that rapamycin inhibited calcification. Here we investigated whether rapamycin could reduce MAC in vivo using the   murine model.   and   mice received 5mg/kg rapamycin or vehicle. Calcification content was assessed via microCT, and vascular morphology and extracellular matrix content were assessed histologically. Immunostaining and western blot analysis were used to examine SMC phenotype and extracellular matrix content. Rapamycin prolonged   mice lifespan, decreased mineral density in the arteries, maintained SMC contractile phenotype, and improved vessel structure, however, calcification volume was unchanged.   mice with SMC-specific deletion of Raptor or Rictor did not recapitulate treatment with rapamycin. These findings suggest rapamycin promotes beneficial vascular remodeling in vessels with MAC.",

In this scientific statement, we review the generic ethical and practical principles underlying allocation principles and examine and describe different European HASs with the purpose of discussing impact of outcomes for patients with advanced HF. It is shown that European HASs differ significantly with respect to which patients are prioritized and the methods by which the prioritization is performed. It is argued that the most commonly used parameter to describe success of a HAS, namely 1-year survival after heart transplantation, is a poor metric of HAS performance. The impact of HASs should be evaluated by several measures such as survival from listing, time to transplantation, the characteristics of patients undergoing heart transplantation, and over a longer time interval to understand the balance of early and late post-transplant risks and benefit. Mapping European HASs is a step towards understanding these factors and further research should determine the optimal HAS in a given HF population at a given time.",

ICM patients and mice exhibited elevated Treg numbers but suppressed Foxp3. miR-223-3p was upregulated in ICM-sEVs and inversely correlated with functional Tregs. ICM-sEVs administration aggravated ventricular remodeling post myocardial infarction (MI) in mice while reducing Treg frequency and elevating miR-223-3p in vitro. miR-223 knockdown increased Treg cell number and Foxp3 expression, whereas miR-223 overexpression reversed the phenotype. ICM-sEVs aggravate ventricular remodeling post-MI and promote miR-223-3p-mediated Treg cell dysfunction.",

  "abstract": "The study aimed to explore the association between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and heart failure (HF) using echocardiography and NT-proBNP. The study also derived an NT-proBNP cut-off for diagnosing HF by echo in Asian Indians with T2D. A retrospective study was performed using data from individuals with T2D, aged ≥ 18 years, who visited diabetes clinics in India between March 2019 and December 2023. NT-proBNP levels were quantified by chemiluminescence, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed from echo using two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. Heart failure was classified based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to determine the optimal NT-proBNP cut-off for diagnosing HF by echo. Among the 1189 study individuals included in the study (714 men and 475 women), 5.9% were identified as having HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), 5.5% had mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and 14.1% had HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) while the rest (74.5%) had LVEF > 50%. Elevated NT-proBNP levels were observed in those with reduced ejection fraction. ROC analysis identified an optimal NT-proBNP threshold of 398 pg/mL for diagnosing HF, with 87% sensitivity and 78% specificity. HF prevalence increased with age, peaking at 30.6% in individuals aged 61-70 years. Women with HF had higher NT-proBNP levels than men. In this diabetes clinic population, 11.5% of individuals with T2D had moderate to reduced LVEF. Early identification of HF using echocardiography and NT-proBNP in a diabetes clinic could help improve prognosis.",

A comprehensive search across multiple databases was conducted, identifying 20 published and ongoing RCTs that examined the effects of siRNA therapies such as inclisiran, olpasiran, and SLN360 on Lp(a) levels. The included studies were analyzed to assess Lp(a) reductions and other lipid-related outcomes. The RCTs demonstrated significant reductions in Lp(a) levels following siRNA therapy. Additional reductions were noted in LDL-c and apolipoprotein B levels. Side effects were typically mild, including injection site reactions. siRNA therapies show promise in effectively lowering Lp(a) levels, with minimal adverse effects.

  "abstract": "Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a hereditary channelopathy that affects cardiac electrical signal transmission, with SCN5A gene mutation being the most common cause. Current BrS therapy primarily relies on Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators, which are limited to arrhythmia prevention. Recent research has explored gene therapy as an alternative approach for managing BrS. Resveratrol, a non-ketone polyphenol compound, exhibits cardioprotective effects due to its antioxidant properties, which can influence gene expression through cellular signaling pathways, thereby modulating adeno-associated virus (AAV). This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of resveratrol in enhancing the induction of AAV-based viral vectors as a potential definitive therapy for SCN5A mutations in BrS patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PLOS ONE. The final stage involved assessing the eligibility of 47 studies, followed by a full-text review, which included seven studies for further analysis. The findings indicate that this therapeutic approach highlights resveratrol's crucial role as an activator of deacetylase proteins, influencing DNA repair processes, cell cycle regulation, and energy metabolism. Resveratrol facilitates the modulation of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels, enabling calcium ion (Ca ⁺) influx into cardiomyocytes, thereby maintaining normal cardiac rhythm. Resveratrol enhances AAV-mediated gene delivery and expression through p53 pathway activation. Experimental studies have demonstrated that AAV-MOG1 gene therapy can restore sodium channel function, improve cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities, and ameliorate the clinical manifestations of BrS. Thus, resveratrol is potentially an inducer of AAV-mediated gene therapy for BrS.",

  "abstract": "Autologous free flap transplantation is the most economical and effective method for clinical treatment of large-area trauma, but the shortage of flap donors prevents widespread use of this method. Hair follicle stem cells have great potential to repair wounds, but wound repair by hair follicle stem cells has not yet met expectations. We used a wound model of Bama mini-pigs and treated the wound with autologous hair follicles or flaps. The wound healing was observed on days 7, 14, and 21 post-surgery and wound healing rates were analyzed using Image J software. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate re-epithelialization of the wound. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the expression of hair follicle stem cell markers (CK15, Sox9) and explore the mechanism of wound repair. This research found that autologous hair follicles can accelerate wound healing. The efficiency of hair follicles in wound repair is related to their structure. Dermal papilla acts as a biological barrier to hair follicle-mediated wound repair. Dermal papilla removal enhances wound healing efficiency, likely by relieving dermal papilla-imposed restrictions on hair follicle stem cell migration. Autologous hair follicles for wound repair has the advantages of minimal damage, simple fabrication, and abundant source, which may be able to replace the flap transplantation as a therapeutic strategy in the future. This study is helpful to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of hair follicles involved in wound repair, and has important academic and clinical value for solving the problem of shortage flap donor.",

Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to assess agreement between non-certified (n = 4) vs. DGK-certified readers (n = 4). ICC for assessment of luminal narrowing, plaque composition, and high-risk features were, respectively, 0.65 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.59-0.69), 0.64 (95%CI 0.45-0.80), and 0.45 (95%CI 0.22-0.66) for non-certified versus 0.78 (95%CI 0.74-0.81), 0.88 (95%CI 0.79-0.93), and 0.89 (95%CI 0.81-0.95) for DGK-certified readers (p < 0.001 for all).

  "abstract": " Pressure injuries pose a significant challenge in healthcare, adversely impacting individuals' quality of life and healthcare systems, particularly in intensive care units. The effective identification of at-risk individuals is crucial, but traditional scales have limitations, prompting the development of new tools. Artificial intelligence offers a promising approach to identifying and preventing pressure injuries in critical care settings. This review aimed to assess the extent of the literature regarding the use of artificial intelligence technologies in the prediction of pressure injuries in critically ill patients in intensive care units to identify gaps in current knowledge and direct future research.   The review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology for scoping reviews, and the study protocol was prospectively registered on the Open Science Framework platform.   This review included 14 studies, primarily highlighting the use of machine learning models trained on electronic health records data for predicting pressure injuries. Between 6 and 86 variables were used to train these models. Only two studies reported the clinical deployment of these models, reporting results such as reduced nursing workload, decreased prevalence of hospital-acquired pressure injuries, and decreased intensive care unit length of stay.   Artificial intelligence technologies present themselves as a dynamic and innovative approach, with the ability to identify risk factors and predict pressure injuries effectively and promptly. This review synthesizes information about the use of these technologies and guides future directions and motivations.",

  "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to the lower extremities. PAD has been traditionally associated with atherosclerosis. However, recent studies have found that thrombotic events triggered by medial arterial calcification (MAC) is the primary cause of chronic limb ischemia below the knee. MAC is localized around the elastic fibers surrounding smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in arteries. Matrix GLA protein (MGP) binds circulating calcium and prevents hydroxyapatite mineral deposition, while also modulating pro-osteogenic signaling by attenuating BMP-2-mediated activation of   gene expression.   mice develop severe MAC and die around 8 weeks after birth due to aortic rupture or heart failure. We previously discovered a rare genetic disease Arterial Calcification due to Deficiency of CD73 (ACDC), in which patients present with extensive MAC in their lower extremity arteries. Using a patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell model, we found that rapamycin inhibited calcification. Here we investigated whether rapamycin could reduce MAC in vivo using the   murine model.   and   mice received 5mg/kg rapamycin or vehicle. Calcification content was assessed via microCT, and vascular morphology and extracellular matrix content were assessed histologically. Immunostaining and western blot analysis were used to examine SMC phenotype and extracellular matrix content. Rapamycin prolonged   mice lifespan, decreased mineral density in the arteries, maintained SMC contractile phenotype, and improved vessel structure, however, calcification volume was unchanged.   mice with SMC-specific deletion of Raptor or Rictor did not recapitulate treatment with rapamycin. These findings suggest rapamycin promotes beneficial vascular remodeling in vessels with MAC.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted on individuals aged 35-65 years as part of the population-based Mashhad Stroke and Heart Atherosclerotic Disorder (MASHAD) study. Participants were allocated into two groups based on the presence of MetS. ECGs were coded using the Minnesota coding system.

Among the 9,035 available ECG data, the overall prevalence of ischemic ECG presentations was significantly higher in those with MetS than in those without (  < 0.05), except for minor ischemia (  = 0.787). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that MetS was independently associated with major ischemia presentation in ECG (OR = 1.254, 95% CI 1.103-1.425,   < 0.001), but no association was found with minor ischemia after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, CVD family history, and physical activity level. Among MetS components, triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly associated with ischemic ECG presentations. Elevated high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level had a negative association with ischemic ECG presentations, while it had a significant positive association only with ST-segment elevation (OR = 1.021, 95% CI 1.011-1.031,   < 0.001).

To examine the association between incident HF and prevalent depression among veterans. This cohort study analyzed sociodemographic and clinical data of US veterans participating in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Birth Cohort. Data were obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse between January 1, 2000, and October 1, 2015. Participants were born between 1945 and 1965, were free of HF at baseline, and met a medical home definition (had 3 outpatient visits within 5 years). Statistical analysis was performed from May 2022 to February 2025. Prevalent depression, defined as 1 inpatient or 2 outpatient visits with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for depression. The primary outcome was time to incident HF, defined as time from baseline to documented date of the first inpatient or second outpatient visit with ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes for HF. A Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for relevant covariates was used to assess the association of depression and incident HF. A total of 2 843 159 veterans (median [SD] age, 54 [49-59] years; 2 677 919 males [94.2%]; 556 914 [19.6%] self-identified as Black, 144 485 [5.1%] as Hispanic, 1 975 068 [69.5%] as White, and 99 011 [3.5%] as other race and ethnicity) were included. Participants were followed up for incident HF over a median (IQR) duration of 6.9 (3.4-11.0) years. Generally, 8.0% of participants (226 247 of 2 843 159) had prevalent depression at baseline. Females made up a larger percentage of those with vs without depression (11.4% vs 5.3%). Participants with depression demonstrated higher unadjusted incident HF rates compared with those without depression (136.9 [95% CI, 132.2-141.7] cases per 10 000 person-years vs 114.6 [95% CI, 113.4-115.9] cases per 10 000 person-years, respectively). After adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiovascular risk factors, depression was associated with an increase in incident HF hazard of 14.0% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.16), with an estimated adjusted median (IQR) incidence rate difference of 16.0 (14.9-18.3) cases per 10 000 person-years. Among patients without comorbidities, depression was associated with a higher increase in incident HF hazard (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.39-1.80), with an estimated adjusted median (IQR) rate difference of 14.2 (9.5-19.5) cases per 10 000 person-years.

  "abstract": "Early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC), defined as being diagnosed before the age of 50 years, is becoming increasingly prevalent. Among these patients, synchronous early-onset colorectal liver metastases (EO-CRLM) have emerged as a leading cause of mortality. This study aims to investigate the epidemiology, clinicopathological characteristics, and survival outcomes related to synchronous EO-CRLM to provide a clearer understanding of the challenges faced by patients with synchronous EO-CRLM. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with synchronous CRLM diagnosed from 2010 to 2019. Patients were then stratified by age of onset: EO-CRLM (younger than 50 years old) and late-onset colorectal liver metastases (LO-CRLM) (50 years old or older). The incidence, limited-duration prevalence rates (over a 10-year period), clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Among 115,422 patients with CRLM, EO-CRLM and LO-CRLM were observed in 17,536 (15.2%) patients and in 97,886 (84.8%) patients, respectively. The annual age-adjusted incidence of EO-CRLM increased from 0.48 to 0.69 per 100,000 population from 2010 to 2019 [average annual percentage change (AAPC): 5.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1 to 6.1], significantly faster than that of LO-CRLM (AAPC difference: 3.5, 95% CI: 2.5 to 4.5; P<0.001). The 10-year limited-duration prevalence for EO-CRLM increased from 0.0004% in 2010 to 0.0020% in 2019 (AAPC: 15.7, 95% CI: 10.2 to 21.5). A comparison of the clinicopathological features revealed that, compared with LO-CRLM, EO-CRLM patients were more likely to reside in urban areas, have higher rates of high school completion, have higher income, and be covered by private insurance/managed care. Genetic analysis revealed EO-CRLM with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high had the largest increase of AAPC of 28.7 (95% CI: 13.1 to 46.3) compared to MSI-low and microsatellite stability (MSS) (P<0.001). Similarly, EO-CRLM patients had a rapid rise in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations with AAPC of 10.6 (95% CI: 8.8 to 12.5). Compared with LO-CRLM, EO-CRLM was associated with improved OS in inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio: 0.876, 95% CI: 0.838 to 0.915; P<0.001). The incidence of EO-CRLM has increased rapidly, and represents a distinct population in terms of socioeconomic and clinicopathological characteristics. Among this cohort, the prognosis of patients with EO-CRLM was favorable compared to that of patients with LO-CRLM.",

Two focus group discussions were organized with participants from the SSA community in Gent, Belgium. Relevant, irrelevant, unclear, and new items were identified. The data was analyzed through the inductive method while consensus agreements were used to arrive at refined themes. Out of the 49 items on the tool, both groups unanimously agreed that 15 items were relevant and 23 irrelevant. Thirteen new items were identified, whereas 15 items were considered unclear. Participants agreed the tool was relevant but should be adapted. Verification and validation of these results in a larger SSA older migrant population in Belgium is strongly recommended.",

  "abstract": " Falls among older adults are a major public health issue. In South Africa, where the elderly population is expected to quadruple within the next three decades, fall prevention is critical.  This study evaluated South African audiologists' perceived knowledge, views and reported practices regarding fall risk screening (FRS) in older adults. A quantitative online survey was conducted using an adapted questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of FRS practice. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics.  The survey received responses from 106 audiologists. Most respondents reported using familiar tools, such as case history and vestibular assessments, to conduct FRS, with fewer utilising functional balance measures. Only 11% of audiologists reported prior knowledge of FRS, while 69% - 74% perceived their knowledge as insufficient to screen or counsel older adults. While 58% recognised FRS as part of the audiologist's scope, only 21% felt comfortable conducting it. Key barriers included insufficient training (80%) and time constraints (48%). Despite this, 98% expressed interest in learning about FRS and 90% believed FRS could enhance the profession.  The findings underscore the need for improved clinical guidelines, educational initiatives and practice standards to better equip audiologists in fall prevention efforts and a collaborative approach to fall risk management for older adults.Contribution: This study emphasises the importance of incorporating FRS into undergraduate audiology curricula and continuous professional development programmes and encourages the use of a biopsychosocial approach and collaboration among multidisciplinary teams in fall risk management for older adults.",

  "abstract": "Delirium often goes unrecognized in the hospital, leading to missed opportunities for management. The objective of this study was to test a multicomponent program for delirium screening and reporting for older, hospitalized adults. We implemented a multicomponent delirium screening and alerting program within two university hospital units for all patients ≥ 70 years of age. The initiative compared performance of the 4 'A's Test, Nursing Delirium Screening Scale, and Confusion Assessment Method. Additionally, the study team provided recurrent educational sessions with nurses and implemented pager and electronic health record alerts for patients who screened positive for delirium. Nurses were then surveyed about their perspectives, and clinical outcomes were abstracted from the medical record. Compared to the Confusion Assessment Method, the proportion of positive screens was significantly higher (positive screens/admissions) with the 4 'A's Test (49/448, 11% vs. 12/399, 3%, p < 0.001) and the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (83/539, 15% vs. 12/399, 3%, p < 0.001). Among surveyed nurses, 32/41 (78%) expressed that the alerting system provided at least \"moderate\" motivation to screen for delirium, and 35/41 (85%) voiced that it provided at least \"moderate\" motivation to record positive screens. Most respondents (23/42, 55%) reported recurrent educational sessions as \"very helpful.\" Positive screens were associated with higher mortality (6.6% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.003), longer hospitalizations (13 [± 11] days vs. 7 [± 11], p < 0.001), and higher likelihood of discharge to care facilities (45% vs. 23%, p < 0.001). Positive delirium screening rates were higher with the 4AT and NuDesc compared to the CAM. Additionally, alerting systems and educational initiatives served as motivating factors for delirium screening and charting.",

  "abstract": "Cirrhosis is the end stage of many chronic liver diseases, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. The alkaline phosphatase to albumin ratio (APAR) index is a new indicator related to the prognostic risk of many diseases. This study was aimed at exploring the association between the APAR index and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis who were 18 years of age or older and admitted to the intensive care unit were included from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) - Version 3.0 database in this study. The primary endpoint of this study was all-cause mortality at 365- days, with secondary endpoints at 90-days and 28-days after admission. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI between the APAR index and endpoints were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression model was created to explore the relationship between the APAR index and cirrhosis. Furthermore, we explored the predictive value of the APAR index in different populations of cirrhosis through subgroup analysis. A total of 2,109 patients with cirrhosis were included from the MIMIC-IV database. After adjusting for potential covariates, APAR as a continuous variable was significantly positively associated with all-cause mortality at 28-days (HR: 2.007, 95% CI: 1.369, 2.948; P < 0.001), 90-days (HR: 2.392, 95% CI: 1.642, 3.495; P < 0.001), and 365-days (HR: 2.418, 95% CI: 1.660, 3.534; P < 0.001) in cirrhotic patients. When APAR was a categorical variable, compared with patients in the lower APAR group, the risk of 365-days all-cause mortality in patients of the higher APAR group significantly increased (HR: 1.451, 95%CI: 1.197, 1.758). APAR was linearly related to all-cause mortality at 28-days, 90-days and 365-days after admission (P for non-linearity = 0.221, 0.390, and 0.344, respectively). Subgroup analysis indicated that among patients with cirrhosis complicated with hepatorenal syndrome, those without spontaneous peritonitis or portal hypertension/esophageal varices, and those receiving human albumin infusion, elevated APAR levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of long-term death. A higher APAR index is significantly associated with the risk of all-cause mortality in cirrhosis. APAR may be a potential biomarker for evaluating the long-term prognosis of critically ill patients with cirrhosis.",

  "abstract": "Managing older patients presenting at the Emergency Department (ED) poses challenges due to their predisposition to present with nonspecific complaints (NSC). With an ageing population and ED overcrowding, significance of NSC is expected to grow. Therefore, we implemented a structured care pathway to address the complexity of NSC presentations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectivity of this care pathway. We conducted a before-and-after study to evaluate the NSC care pathway, which included risk stratification, standardized assessment and diagnostic measurements. A control group receiving standard care was established in two hospitals (hospital 1 and 2) before implementation. Patient enrollment occurred from April 2021 to November 2024. Outcomes included length of stay in the ED (LOS-ED) and in hospital (LOS-H), revisits, diagnostic completeness (i.e. 100% agreement between all ED and hospital discharge diagnoses) and perceived quality of care. In total, 164 control and 235 intervention patients were included in this study. Median LOS-ED and LOS-H did not show significant differences between the control and intervention patients. Implementation of the care pathway showed non-significant trends towards improved diagnostic completeness (47.1% vs 37.2%, p = 0.096). This might be associated with the non-significant observed decrease in 30-day readmissions (7.5% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.256). Patient-reported outcomes indicated a positive experience with the quality of care. The care pathway did not improve LOS-ED and LOS-H as hypothesized, possibly due to logistical barriers and patient variability. However, trends suggested improved diagnostic completeness and fewer 30-day readmission rates. Further research initiatives are needed to enhance patient outcomes and care for NSC patients.

This study compared microsurgical and radiosurgical treatments, focusing on three. (1) evaluating post-treatment clinical outcomes, (2) assessing the effect on QoL and (3) analyzing complication rates, particularly in geriatric patients. In this retrospective study, 586 patients underwent either microsurgery or gamma knife radiosurgery between 1990 and 2013. Demographic and treatment data were collected, including quality of life (QoL) assessments using the Short Form 36 (SF-36) and evaluations of the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS). Complication rates were also analyzed. The study included 194 microsurgery patients and 392 radiosurgery patients. Radiosurgery patients showed significantly better postoperative hearing and facial nerve function (p < 0.05). QoL scores were higher in the radiosurgery group for physical and emotional role functioning, while microsurgery patients (including aged 65 years and older) reported better scores for bodily pain and general health perceptions. Neurological complications were 41.9% in the microsurgery group, most of them being permanent (92.9%). Radiosurgery generally showed better preservation of hearing, facial nerve function, and quality of life compared to microsurgery, although both treatments appeared equally effective in older patients.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop consensus definitions and diagnostic criteria for sarcopenic obesity tailored to Asia-Oceania populations, a condition characterized by reduced skeletal muscle mass and function with excess adipose tissue. Experts from various fields formed a working group under the Asia-Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity (AOASO) and the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics Asia/Oceania Region (IAGG-AOR). The group convened four meetings, employing the Delphi technique to achieve consensus on diagnostic criteria and management strategies for sarcopenic obesity. The consensus defines sarcopenic obesity with a 3-step algorithm, including screening, diagnosis, and intervention. The screening criteria included BMI and waist circumference for obesity and calf circumference, the SARC-F, and the Finger Ring test for sarcopenia. The diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia include assessments of muscle mass (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or bioelectrical impedance analysis), muscle strength (handgrip strength), and physical performance (gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery, or the 5-Times Sit-to-Stand Test). Central obesity is the main concern for the diagnosis of obesity. The working group recommends a combination of dietary consultations, increased physical activity, resistance training, and the potential use of oral nutritional supplements and medications for managing sarcopenic obesity. The primary objective is to increase skeletal muscle mass and reduce adipose tissue mass. The established criteria facilitate early recognition and management of sarcopenic obesity, highlighting the need for tailored interventions. Future research should focus on the long-term outcomes of these interventions and the development of pharmacological treatments.",

  "abstract": "The preservation of the pelvic autonomic nervous system in total mesorectal excision remains challenging to date. The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study. The artificial intelligence model for real-time visual neurorecognition in total mesorectal excision was successfully established for the first time in China. Better identification of these autonomic nerves should allow for better preservation of urogenital function, but further research is needed to validate this claim. See Video Abstract .

  "abstract": "Desmoplastic reaction is recognized as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

  "abstract": "Prospective payment models have incentivized reductions in length of stay after surgery. The benefits of abbreviated postoperative hospitalization could be undermined by increased readmissions or postacute care use, particularly for older adults or those with comorbid conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hospitals with accelerated postsurgical discharge accrue total episode savings or incur greater postdischarge payments among patients stratified by age and comorbidity. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. National data from the 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files for July 2012 to June 2015 were used. We included Medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective colectomy and stratified the cohort by age (65-69, 70-79, ≥80 y) and Elixhauser comorbidity score (low: ≤0; medium: 1-5; and high: >5). Patients were categorized by the hospital's mode length of stay, reflecting \"usual\" care. In a multilevel model, we compared mean total episode payments and components thereof among age and comorbidity categories, stratified by hospital mode length of stay. Among 88,860 patients, mean total episode payments were lower in shortest versus longest length of stay hospitals across all age and comorbidity strata and were similar between age groups (65-69 y: $28,951 vs $30,566, p = 0.014; 70-79 y: $31,157 vs $32,044, p = 0.073; ≥80 y: $33,779 vs $35,771, p = 0.005) but greater among higher comorbidity (low: $23,107 vs $24,894, p = 0.001; medium: $30,809 vs $32,282, p = 0.038; high: $44,097 vs $46641, p < 0.001). Postdischarge payments were similar among length-of-stay hospitals by age (65-69 y: ∆$529; 70-79 y: ∆$291; ≥80 y: ∆$872, p = 0.25) but greater among high comorbidity (low: ∆$477; medium: ∆$480; high: ∆$1059; p = 0.02). Administrative data do not capture patient-level factors that influence postacute care use (preference, caregiver availability). Hospitals achieving shortest length of stay after surgery accrue lower total episode payments without a compensatory increase in postacute care spending, even among patients at oldest age and with greatest comorbidity.

  "abstract": "The Clavien-Dindo classification is widely used to report postoperative morbidity but may underestimate the severity of colectomy complications. The purpose of this study was to assess how well the Clavien-Dindo classification represents the severity of all grades of complications after colectomy using cost of care modeling. This was a retrospective cohort study. The study was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients (N = 1807) undergoing elective colon or rectal resections without a stoma performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 who were followed up for ≥90 days, were not transferred to other hospitals, and did not receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy were included in the study. Complication severity was measured by the highest-grade complication per patient and attributable outpatient and inpatient costs. Associations were evaluated between patient complication grade and cost during 3 time periods: the 90 days after surgery, index admission, and postdischarge (<90 d). Of the 1807 patients (median age = 62 y), 779 (43%) had a complication; 80% of these patients had only grade 1 or 2 complications. Increasing patient complication grade correlated with 90-day cost, driven by inpatient cost differences (p < 0.001). For grade 1 and 2 patients, most costs were incurred after discharge and were the same between these grade categories. Among patients with a single complication (52%), there was no difference in index hospitalization, postdischarge, or total 90-day costs between grade 1 and 2 categories. The study was limited by its retrospective design and generalizability. The Clavien-Dindo classification correlates well with 90-day costs, driven largely by inpatient resource use. Clavien-Dindo does not discriminate well among patients with low-grade complications in terms of their substantial postdischarge costs. These patients represent 80% of patients with a complication after colectomy. Examining the long-term burden associated with complications can help refine the Clavien-Dindo classification for use in colectomy studies. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B521.

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

La supervivencia general disminuyó al aumentar el estadio del cáncer, pero no fue diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal. La razón de riesgo para la sobrevida libre de recurrencia por aumento de cm2 en el área de la superficie grasa perirrenal fue de 1.00 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0.99-1.01) ajustada por edad, sexo, categoría de la Sociedad Americana de Anestesiólogos, ubicación del tumor y complicación postoperatoria según Clavien-Dindo ≥ 2) La incidencia acumulada de recurrencia con muerte como un riesgo competitivo no fue estadísticamente diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal (p = 0.06). Los análisis de subgrupos mostraron una tendencia no significativa para que los hombres con un área de superficie menor en grasa perirrenal tengan un menor riesgo de recurrencia y las mujeres un mayor riesgo.LIMITACIONES:En todos los estudios basados en registros puede haber errores distribuidos aleatoriamente. Los resultados solo pueden generalizarse a resecciones de colon. Nuestra cohorte osciló durante un gran lapso de años.CONCLUSIONES:No se encontró asociación entre el área de superficie de la grasa perirrenal y la sobrevida general, ni con la sobrevida libre de recurrencia o la incidencia acumulada de recurrencia específica de la causa en pacientes sometidos a resección de colon por cáncer.

  "abstract": "Watchful waiting in patients with rectal cancer with complete clinical response after chemoradiation therapy has gained increased popularity to avoid morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. Irradiation of the pelvis causes bowel dysfunction, but the effect on anorectal sensory function remains obscure in this patient category. The aim of this study was to characterize the sensory pathways of the gut-brain axis in patients with rectal cancer treated solely with chemoradiation therapy (nonconventional regime/dose) compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study. Sensory evaluation by rectal distension was performed and cortical evoked potentials were recorded during rapid balloon distensions of the rectum and anal canal. Latencies and amplitudes of cortical evoked potentials were compared, and the relative amplitude of 5 spectral bands from recorded cortical evoked potentials was used as an additional proxy of neuronal processing. Patients with rectal cancer solely with chemoradiation therapy (n = 13) a median of 3.2 years ago (range, 2.3-5.6 y) and healthy volunteers (n = 13) were included. Cortical evoked potentials were measured. Patients had 35% lower rectal capacity at a maximum tolerable volume (p = 0.007). We found no differences in rectal cortical evoked potential latencies (p = 0.09) and amplitudes (p = 0.38) between groups. However, spectral analysis of rectal cortical evoked potentials showed a decrease in θ (4-8 Hz) and an increase in β (12-32 Hz) band activity in patients (all p < 0.001). Anal cortical potentials showed an increase in α (8-12 Hz) and β and a decrease in γ (32-70 Hz) band activity (all p < 0.001) in patients compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study of limited size. Chemoradiation therapy for distal rectal cancer causes abnormal cortical processing of both anal and rectal sensory input. Such central changes may play a role in symptomatic patients, especially when refractory to local treatments. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270. RESPUESTA NEURONAL ANORMAL A ESTÍMULOS RECTALES Y ANALES, EN PACIENTES TRATADOS POR CÁNCER RECTAL DISTAL, CON QUIMIORRADIOTERAPIA DE DOSIS ALTA, SEGUIDA DE ESPERA VIGILANTE: La espera vigilante en pacientes de cáncer rectal, con respuesta clínica completa después de la quimiorradiación, ha ganado una mayor popularidad en evitar la morbilidad y mortalidad asociadas con la cirugía. La irradiación de la pelvis causa disfunción intestinal, pero el efecto sobre la función sensorial ano-rectal sigue siendo no claro, en esta categoría de pacientes.El objetivo de este estudio, fue caracterizar las vías sensoriales del eje intestino-cerebro en pacientes con cáncer rectal, tratados únicamente con quimiorradiación (régimen / dosis no convencional), en comparación con voluntarios sanos.Es un estudio exploratorio.Se realizó una evaluación sensorial por distensión rectal y se registraron los potenciales evocados corticales, durante las distensiones rápidas con balón en recto y canal anal. Se compararon las latencias y amplitudes de los potenciales evocados corticales, y la amplitud relativa de cinco bandas espectrales registradas, de potenciales evocados corticales, se usaron como proxy adicional del procesamiento neuronal.Pacientes de cáncer rectal, únicamente con terapia de quimiorradiación (n = 13) mediana de 3.2 años (rango 2.3-5.6) y voluntarios sanos (n = 13).Potenciales evocados corticales.Pacientes tuvieron una capacidad rectal menor del 35%, al volumen máximo tolerable (p = 0.007). No encontramos diferencias en las latencias potenciales evocadas corticales rectales (p = 0.09) y amplitudes (p = 0.38) entre los grupos. Sin embargo, el análisis espectral de los potenciales evocados corticales rectales, mostró una disminución en theta (4-8 Hz) aumento en beta (12-32 Hz), y actividad en banda en pacientes (todos p <0.001). Los potenciales evocados corticales anales mostraron un aumento en alfa (8-12 Hz) y beta, disminución en gamma (32-70 Hz), y actividad en banda (todos p <0.001), en pacientes comparados a voluntarios sanos.Este es un estudio exploratorio de tamaño limitado.La quimiorradiación para el cáncer rectal distal, ocasiona procesos corticales sensoriales anormales anales y rectales.

  "abstract": "Health care costs and wait times for colorectal cancer treatment are increasing in Canada, but the association between the 2 remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between wait times and health care costs and utilization. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study. This study was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2004 and 2014 were sorted and ranked into quintiles based on the time from index contact for a colorectal cancer-related symptom to first treatment. The primary outcome is risk-adjusted health care costs, and the secondary outcomes include health care utilization and overall mortality. We included a total of 6936 patients. Total wait times ranged between 0 and 762 days. In comparison with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly increased costs (short: mean cost ratio 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32; moderate: mean cost ratio 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43; long: mean cost ratio 1.48; 95% CI, 1.33-1.64; and very long: mean cost ratio 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.54). Compared with very short wait times, longer wait times were associated with significantly lower risk of mortality (short: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; moderate: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.80; long: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; very long: HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.85). The median number of pretreatment radiological and endoscopic investigations and surgeon clinic visits increased over the study period across all wait time categories. This is a nonrandomized, retrospective cohort study with potentially limited generalizability. Patients with very short and short wait times are likely those diagnosed with life-threatening complications of colorectal cancer. Outside this window, patients with longer wait times experience increased health care costs and utilization with similar overall mortality. Improved care coordination and patient navigation may help contain the increasing wait times and associated increasing health care costs and utilization.

  "abstract": "Early detection of postoperative recurrence is beneficial for patients with cancer; however, optimal surveillance remains an issue. To optimize the follow-up plan, the estimation of an individual patient's risk of recurrence is indispensable. This study aimed to establish a statistical model for predicting the risk of organ-specific recurrence after curative resection of colon cancer. This was a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral hospital. This study included 1720 patients with colon cancer treated at the University of Tokyo Hospital between 1997 and 2015. Data were retrospectively retrieved from patient medical charts. The risk score was developed using a competing risk model in a derivation cohort (973 patients treated in 1997-2009) and then validated in a validation cohort (747 patients treated in 2010-2015). Patients who underwent curative resection for stage I to III colon cancer were included. The prediction of the incidence of postoperative liver and lung metastasis of colon cancer was measured. The factors selected for the prediction model for liver metastasis included differentiation, T category, venous invasion, N category, and preoperative CEA level. The model for lung metastasis included sex, lymphatic invasion, venous invasion, N category, preoperative CEA level, and malignant bowel obstruction. During external validation, the area under the curve at 60 months was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.71-0.84) for liver metastasis and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.81) for lung metastasis. The generalizability of the model to different healthcare settings remains to be elucidated. We developed a prediction model to estimate the risk of recurrence in the liver and lung after curative resection of colon cancer, which demonstrated good discrimination ability in the external validation cohort. Our model can aid clinicians and patients in customizing postoperative surveillance according to an individual patient's risk of organ-specific recurrence.

DESARROLLO Y VALIDACIÓN DE UN MODELO DE PREDICCIÓN PARA RECURRENCIAS ESPECÍFICAS DESPUÉS DE RESECCIÓN CURATIVA DE UN CÁNCER DE COLON: La detección temprana de una recidiva postoperatoria es beneficiosa para los pacientes afectados de cáncer. Sin embargo, la mejor vigilancia sigue siendo un problema. Para optimizar el plan de seguimiento, la estimación del riesgo individual de recurrencia de un paciente es indispensable. Establecer un modelo estadístico para predecir el riesgo de recurrencia en un organo específico luego de la resección curativa de un cáncer de colon. DISEÑO:: Estudio retrospectivo de cohortes en un hospital de referencia terciaria. Este estudio incluyó 1720 pacientes con cáncer de colon tratados en el Hospital de la Universidad de Tokio entre 1997 y 2015. Los datos se recuperaron retrospectivamente de las historias clinicas de los pacientes. La puntuación de riesgo fué desarrollada utilizando un modelo de riesgo competitivo en cohortes de derivación (973 pacientes tratados en 1997-2009) y luego se lo validó en cohortes de validación (747 pacientes tratados en 2010-2015). Todos aquellos casos que se sometieron a una resección curativa de cáncer de colon en estadio I-III RESULTADOS PRINCIPLES:: La predicción de la incidencia de metástasis hepáticas y pulmonares postoperatorias del cáncer de colon. Los factores seleccionados para el modelo de predicción de metástasis hepáticas incluyeron diferenciación tumoral, categoría T, invasión venosa, categoría N y nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio. El modelo de predicción de metástasis pulmonar incluyó el sexo del paciente, la invasión linfática, la invasión venosa, la categoría N, el nivel de antígeno carcinoembrionario preoperatorio y la obstrucción intestinal maligna. Durante la validación externa, el área inferior de la curva a 60 meses fue de 0,78 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,71 a 0,84) para las metástasis hepáticas y de 0,72 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0,64 a 0,81) para las metástasis pulmonares. La generalización del presente modelo a diferentes entornos de atención en salud aún no ha podido ser dilucidado. Desarrollamos un modelo de predicción para estimar el riesgo de recurrencia en el hígado y el pulmón después de resección curativa de cáncer de colon, éste modelo demostró una buena capacidad de discriminación en las cohortes de validación externa. El modelo puede ayudar a médicos y pacientes a personalizar la vigilancia postoperatoria de acuerdo con el riesgo individual de recurrencia específica en un órgano específico.

  "abstract": "Biopsies are routinely obtained in the workup of large colorectal polyps before endoscopic resection. This study aimed to examine how reliable biopsies are in terms of reflecting the true histopathology of large colorectal polyps, in the clinical routine. This is a retrospective study. Data from patients undergoing polypectomy of large colorectal polyps at the endoscopy unit, Skåne University Hospital Malmö, between January 2014 and December 2016 were scrutinized. A total of 485 colorectal lesions were biopsied within 1 year before complete endoscopic removal. Biopsy-obtained specimens were compared with completely resected specimens in terms of concordance and discordance and if the final result was upgraded or downgraded. The primary outcome measured was the concordance between biopsy-obtained specimens and completely resected specimens. Median lesion size was 3 cm (range 1-11). In 189 cases (39%), biopsies did not provide a correct dysplastic grade compared with final pathology after complete resection. One hundred forty-three cases (29%) and 46 cases (9%) were upgraded and downgraded. The percentage of cases with discordant biopsy results was 40% in cases with 1 biopsy taken and 38% in cases where multiple biopsies had been sampled. Time from biopsy to complete resection did not influence the erroneous outcome of biopsies. Notably, the percentage of discordant biopsy results was 37% and 35% in lesions measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 4 cm. However, this percentage increased to 48% in colorectal lesions larger than 4 cm. This study was designed to reflect the clinical routine, the number of biopsies obtained and forceps technique were hence not standardized, which constitutes a limitation. This study demonstrates that cancer-negative forceps biopsies of large colorectal polyps, referred for endoscopic resection, are not reliable. Considering that endoscopic resection of lesions containing superficial cancer is plausible, the clinical value of forceps biopsies in lesions suitable for endoscopic resection is questionable.

LAS BIOPSIAS CON FÓRCEPS NO SON CONFIABLES EN EL ESTUDIO DE LAS LESIONES COLORRECTALES GRANDES REFERIDAS PARA RESECCIÓN ENDOSCÓPICA: ¿DEBERÍAN ABANDONARSE?: Las biopsias se obtienen de forma rutinaria en el estudio de pólipos colorrectales grandes previo a resección endoscópica. Analizar que tan confiables son las biopsias en cuanto a reflejar la verdadera histopatología de los pólipos colorrectales grandes, en la rutina clínica. DISEÑO:: Este es un estudio retrospectivo. Los datos de pacientes sometidos a polipectomía de pólipos colorrectales grandes en la unidad de endoscopia, en Skåne University Hospital Malmö, entre enero de 2014 y diciembre de 2016 fueron examinados. Un total de 485 lesiones colorrectales se biopsiaron dentro de un año antes de la resección endoscópica completa. Las muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia se compararon con las muestras completas resecadas en términos de concordancia y discordancia, y si el resultado final ascendió o disminuyó de categoría. Concordancia entre muestras obtenidas mediante biopsia y muestras completamente resecadas. La mediana de tamaño de lesiones fue de 3 cm (rango 1-11). En 189 casos (39%) las biopsias no proporcionaron un grado de displasia correcto en comparación con la patología final después de la resección completa. 143 casos (29%) y 46 casos (9%) ascendieron y descendieron de categoría, respectivamente. El porcentaje de casos con resultados de biopsia discordantes fue del 40% en los casos con una sola biopsia tomada y del 38% en los casos en los que se tomaron múltiples biopsias. El tiempo desde la biopsia hasta la resección completa no influyó en el resultado erróneo de las biopsias. Notablemente, el porcentaje de resultados de biopsia discordantes fue de 37% y 35% en lesiones que midieron 1-2 cm y 2-4 cm, respectivamente. Sin embargo, este porcentaje aumentó a 48% en lesiones colorrectales mayores de 4 cm. Este estudio se diseñó para reflejar la rutina clínica, el número de biopsias obtenidas y la técnica de fórceps no fueron estandarizadas, lo que constituye una limitación. Este estudio demuestra que las biopsias con fórceps negativas a cáncer, de pólipos colorrectales grandes referidas para resección endoscópica, no son confiables. Teniendo en cuenta que la resección endoscópica de lesiones que contienen cáncer superficial es posible, el valor clínico de las biopsias con fórceps en lesiones aptas para la resección endoscópica es cuestionable.

  "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to examine how intermediate-risk factors affect the oncological outcomes of patients diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stage IB2 cervical cancer who do not undergo any adjuvant treatment. A multicentric retrospective study that involved 612 patients who were diagnosed with stage IA-IB2 cervical cancer at seven tertiary gynaecological oncology centres between 1993 and 2023 was conducted. A total of 232 patients were classified as FIGO 2018 stage IB2. Patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, parametrial or surgical border involvement, received adjuvant therapy and synchronous tumours were excluded from the present cohort. Therefore, the present study cohort consisted of 120 patients who had undergone radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Among the 120 patients, 89 (74.2%) had squamous cell cancer, 18 (15%) had adenocarcinoma, 2 (1.7%) had a mixed type tumour consisting of squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma and 11 (9.1%) had other types of tumours (adenosquamous cancer and glassy cell cancer). Deep cervical stromal invasion was found in 68 (56.7%) patients. The duration of patient follow-up varied from 1 to 246 months, with a median of 36 months. Overall, 6 patients (5%) experienced recurrence and 1 patient (0.8%) succumbed to the disease. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 94%, whereas the 3-year overall survival rate was 99%. The presence of deep cervical stromal invasion had a statistically significant impact on DFS (P=0.038). Deep cervical stromal invasion was found to be associated with recurrence in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. Hence, the present study demonstrated that the presence of deep cervical stromal invasion may be considered a key parameter in determining whether adjuvant treatment should be applied in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer.",

  "abstract": "This research investigates the relationships between the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) and the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in older adults with hypertension. Utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate the potential mediating role of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in these relationships. A cohort of 5,276 participants, aged 65 years or older and diagnosed with hypertension, was extracted from the NHANES database. The main outcomes examined were the odds of CVD and mortality, utilizing data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the relationship between CDAI and CVD. Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were utilized to analyze the relationship between CDAI and mortality. Mediation analysis was conducted to assess the potential intermediary role of TyG-related indicators-specifically TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR- in the connection between CDAI and mortality. The mean CDAI for the study participants was 1.88 ± 3.90, and the average age was 74.15 ± 5.96 years. During an average follow-up duration of 109.51 months, 4,712 cases of CVD and 725 recorded deaths were observed. In the fully adjusted models, CDAI showed a negative association with both CVD (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.94, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.92-0.97) and mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93-0.97). Mediation analysis indicated that the TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR indices accounted for 33.1%, 34.3%, and 19.1% of the relationship between CDAI and mortality, respectively. A higher CDAI demonstrated an inverse association with both CVD and mortality in elderly hypertensive individuals. The relationship was partially mediated by TyG-related indices, indicating that increased antioxidant intake may lead to improved health outcomes and a decreased risk of poor prognosis in this population.",

A total of 39 patients underwent surgical management for endometriosis between October 2022 and November 2024. Thirty-six patients were followed up for 1-24 months. Among the 39 cases, 18 (42.6%) were identified incidentally in operations for other indications, while 21 (53.8%) were clinically diagnosed or confirmed with previous laparoscopy. Twelve (30.8%) cases were classified as stage I-II and 27 (69.2%) as stage III-IV. Surgical approaches included laparoscopy in 23 (59.0%) cases, robotic assistance in 13 (33.3%), and 2 cases were converted from laparoscopy to laparotomy. Advanced techniques utilized included ureterolysis, enterolysis, diaphragm resection, bowel shaving, bowel disc resection, segmental bowel resection, appendectomy, partial bladder cystectomy, and hypogastric nerve sparing. Intraoperative complications included 1 ureteral thermal injury and 1 bladder laceration. Postoperative complications consisted of 1 pyelonephritis and 1 incisional cellulitis. No complications related to urinary or bowel functional disorders occurred postoperatively. Among the 19 patients who regularly used pain medication before surgery, 16 patients discontinued pain medications, while 3 patients reduced their usage after surgery. Eight patients are actively trying to conceive, and 1 patient conceived spontaneously. Sixteen patients are receiving various forms of hormonal suppression. With excellent skills and collaboration, the surgical management of endometriosis resulted in minimal complications and optimal postoperative outcomes, significantly benefiting patients in low socioeconomic areas.",

We highlight the complex pathophysiology involving impaired placentation, angiogenic imbalance, immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications. Current management strategies are discussed alongside evolving therapeutic interventions, including low-dose aspirin, statins, and novel agents such as hydrogen sulfide donors and C-type natriuretic peptide. Special emphasis is placed on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities that contribute to disproportionate outcomes, particularly among Black and Indigenous women. We also explore the role of personalized medicine, predictive models, and digital health tools in transforming HDP care. By integrating mechanistic insight with public health strategies and clinical innovation, this review aims to inform multidisciplinary approaches to reduce the burden of HDP and promote equitable maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Background Minimally invasive hysterectomy approaches, including vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic hysterectomy, offer advantages over laparotomic hysterectomy. However, vaginal hysterectomy is less feasible for patients with a large uterus, prior pelvic surgery, adnexal surgery requirements, or malignancy, making laparoscopy or robotic surgery preferable. The SSI Mantra robotic system (Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt. Ltd., India) features an ergonomic open-faced console with a 32-inch 3D 4K monitor, a 23-inch 2D touch monitor for system control and DICOM applications, a head-tracking safety feature, and advanced ergonomic controls. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of robotic hysterectomy using this indigenous system. Materials and methods From February to September 2024, 15 patients underwent robotic hysterectomy at Government Medical College, Nagpur. Patients were counseled about using the SSI Mantra robotic system and surgical risks, including possible conversion to laparotomy or robotic arm injury. The procedure followed a standard robotic port approach with accessory laparoscopic ports. Multiple surgeons performed the surgeries. The primary outcome was operative time, defined from incision start to closure. Additional data collected included patient intubation time, draping time, port placement, docking time, console time, surgical end time, patient out time, and estimated blood loss (fluid volume difference between irrigation and suction). Perioperative complications, readmissions, surgeon experience impact on operative time, conversion to laparotomy, hospital stay duration, hemoglobin drop, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores, and intraoperative strategies (e.g., adhesiolysis, myomectomy) were analyzed. The weight of the excised uterus was also recorded. Results All 15 cases were successfully completed. The mean body mass index was 22.36 kg/m² (range: 19-25). The mean operative time (console use) was 169.41 minutes. Docking time improved from 25 minutes in the first case to five minutes by the 12th. The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days. The average uterine weight was 104.58 g (range: 25-250 g). Estimated blood loss averaged 129.16 mL (range: 30-400 mL). Vaginal cuff closure time was recorded in one case (20 minutes). The mean VAS pain score was 3.91. A hemoglobin drop occurred in four cases, but no postoperative blood transfusions were required. There were no conversions, major complications, or readmissions. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the indigenous robotic system provides enhanced ergonomics, seven degrees of freedom, ease of operation, and improved safety with a shorter learning curve for large uteri. Further studies are needed to assess postoperative and long-term outcomes.",

  "abstract": "BackgroundWhile research has identified many associations between socioeconomic factors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nonsuppression, few qualitative studies have defined the mechanisms by which these factors interrelate and lead to HIV nonsuppression. The development of interventions to achieve universal virologic suppression and eliminate transmission will require a deeper understanding of the individual and social processes that drive antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence and consequent viral nonsuppression.MethodsWe used a semistructured interview-based case-study approach to characterize changes across 3 time points in the lived contexts of 11 adolescents and young adults (aged 15-24 years) from intervention and control arms of a longitudinal HIV intervention trial in rural Kenyan and Ugandan communities. We sought to determine commonalities among those who never virally suppressed, those who became nonsuppressed, and those who moved from nonsuppression to viral suppression, exploring social and behavioral micro-processes or causal chains observed among individuals who share these trajectories.ResultsWe found that supportive family environments, high-quality service provision, and residential and partnership stability free of violence, or that permitted freedom to move and maintain extensive social ties both inside and outside one's immediate community, enabled ART adherence. We also found that several factors combine to have effects beyond each individual factor taken singly, for example, medication side effects were influenced by food insecurity; disclosure was most effective with individuals around whom one may potentially take medication, such as co-resident partners; and mobility compromised adherence when patients did not know how or where to access care in new places.RecommendationsOur findings suggest that to improve virologic suppression, clinical care and interventions should include assessment and strategies to address food insecurity, ART disclosure, and home-based violence from intimate partners or other family members. When such factors are present, we suggest referral for services, including violence prevention and protection services, and food provision for those patients who do not adhere because of medication side effects amplified by lack of food. We further recommend that clinics coordinate regionally to anticipate mobility, facilitate transfer of care to other areas, and ensure clients have access to information about care clinics elsewhere in the region. Longitudinal Case Studies Tracking HIV Viral Suppression or Nonsuppression From Rural East African Adolescents and Young Adults With HIVResearch has identified many associations between socioeconomic factors and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) nonsuppression, but few qualitative studies have defined how these factors interrelate and lead to HIV nonsuppression.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of lymphadenectomy on cancer-specific survival (CSS) in this patient population using a large, population-based dataset. We conducted a retrospective analysis using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, identifying 11,014 patients with stage T1a, low-grade endometrioid carcinoma from 2004 to 2015. Patients were divided into lymphadenectomy and non-lymphadenectomy groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox regression were used to assess CSS and identify independent prognostic factors. Before PSM, the non-lymphadenectomy group had higher CSS compared to the lymphadenectomy group (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.16-2.10, p = .003). After 1:1 PSM, CSS was similar between the two groups (HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.78-1.53, p = .605). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in CSS except for the subgroup with tumor size > 2 cm, where non-lymphadenectomy was associated with better CSS (HR = 0.50, p = .035). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified age, marital status, histological grade, and chemotherapy as independent prognostic factors for CSS, while lymphadenectomy was not (p = .980).. Our findings suggest that lymphadenectomy does not improve CSS in patients with low-grade endometrioid carcinoma of stage T1a.",

  "abstract": "To evaluate the perioperative and long-term outcomes of surgical management of patients with endometriosis at a community hospital in a low socioeconomic district. A total of 39 patients underwent surgical management for endometriosis between October 2022 and November 2024. Thirty-six patients were followed up for 1-24 months. Among the 39 cases, 18 (42.6%) were identified incidentally in operations for other indications, while 21 (53.8%) were clinically diagnosed or confirmed with previous laparoscopy. Twelve (30.8%) cases were classified as stage I-II and 27 (69.2%) as stage III-IV. Surgical approaches included laparoscopy in 23 (59.0%) cases, robotic assistance in 13 (33.3%), and 2 cases were converted from laparoscopy to laparotomy. Advanced techniques utilized included ureterolysis, enterolysis, diaphragm resection, bowel shaving, bowel disc resection, segmental bowel resection, appendectomy, partial bladder cystectomy, and hypogastric nerve sparing. Intraoperative complications included 1 ureteral thermal injury and 1 bladder laceration. Postoperative complications consisted of 1 pyelonephritis and 1 incisional cellulitis. No complications related to urinary or bowel functional disorders occurred postoperatively. Among the 19 patients who regularly used pain medication before surgery, 16 patients discontinued pain medications, while 3 patients reduced their usage after surgery. Eight patients are actively trying to conceive, and 1 patient conceived spontaneously. Sixteen patients are receiving various forms of hormonal suppression. With excellent skills and collaboration, the surgical management of endometriosis resulted in minimal complications and optimal postoperative outcomes, significantly benefiting patients in low socioeconomic areas.",

  "abstract": "In Europe, endometrial carcinoma was found to be the fourth most common tumor in the female population in 2022. The depth of myometrial invasion is a well-established and crucial prognostic risk factor in endometrial cancer patients and is important for choosing the most appropriate management for the patient. However, while the preoperative assessment of tumor invasion carried out using radiological imaging is very important, it is a subjective examination and its accuracy is based on the experience of the operator. In this scenario we proposed a radiomic-based model to predict myometrial invasion for ultrasound images. We collected clinical data and qualitative ultrasound indicators of 77 consecutive patients affected by endometrial carcinoma. After a pre-processing phase of ultrasound images, a pre-trained Inception-V3 convolutional neural network (CNN) was used as features extractor. Then, a binary classification model and a multiclass model were trained, after a double step of feature selection; the first selection stage performed feature filtering based on a nonparametric test, the second stage selected features by evaluating not only the relationship with the outcome of interest, but also the relationship with other predictive features. For the multiclass prediction model, a cascade approach has been developed. The two proposed models were validated in 100 ten-fold cross-validation rounds. In addition, to assess the effect of the potential added value of using this tool in clinical practice, we compared the operator's performance with and without the developed automated support. The binary and multiclass model reached optimal classification performances with a mean AUC value equals to 90.76 (88.63-92.89 IC95%). When the operator was assisted by the radiomic-based decision-making system increased by 10% points in terms of precision. The multiclass model showed the per-classes recall were 93.33%, 71.88% and 90.00%, for focal infiltration, infiltration less than 50%, and infiltration greater than 50% class, respectively. The performances of the operator when assisted by the radiomic-based decision-making system were statistically superior both in terms of overall accuracy and per-class recall of intermediate class (rising to 82.82% and 71.88% compared to 71.88% and 56.25%, respectively). The proposed models have the potential to standardize examinations that rely on subjective evaluations, such as ultrasound. They can represent a valid support tool for the clinicians for an accurate estimate of the deep myometrial infiltration already in the diagnosis phase with an easily accessible, low-cost examination that causes no discomfort for the patient such as ultrasound.",

  "abstract": "Despite a significant reduction in neonatal mortality due to advances in neonatal care, preterm birth (PTB) continues to pose a challenge due to the escalating incidence of long-term complications, which refer to health issues that persist or emerge beyond the immediate neonatal period. The impact of PTB, particularly in extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks of gestational age, is not confined to the early years but extends across the lifespan, influencing physical, cognitive, and social development, as well as long-term health outcomes. These complications, which often persist from childhood into adulthood, span multiple systems and create a broad spectrum of health concerns. This comprehensive narrative review of literature delves into the breadth of well-characterized long-term complications associated with PTB, including neurodevelopmental, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and endocrine system disorders. By providing health care providers with a holistic understanding of the potential complications following PTB, this review aims to summarize the current literature and underscore the value of long-term monitoring strategies and proactive evaluations of this population. Our objective is to foster a clinical approach that anticipates these complications, enabling early interventions and better management of these at-risk infants.",

A prospective cohort study. A tertiary hospital centre in Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 130 women with a history of GDM who underwent liver fat assessment at 1 year postpartum. FLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease were assessed at 1 year postpartum, with diagnosis based on transient elastography and specific cardiometabolic criteria. The associations between OGTT glucose values and FLD were evaluated using logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, including age, pre-pregnancy weight, weight and waist circumference at 1 year postpartum and exclusive breastfeeding. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were also conducted to assess the predictive performance of glucose parameters from antepartum and postpartum OGTTs. A total of 44 participants (33.8%) were diagnosed with FLD, with 97.7% meeting metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease criteria. Elevated fasting plasma glucose levels during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.49; 95% CI: 0.93 to 3.57), in the early postpartum period (aOR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.92 to 5.05), or across both periods combined (aOR: 2.16; 95% CI: 0.93 to 7.41) were not independently associated with FLD. In contrast, four abnormal glucose values during pregnancy (aOR: 2.53; 95% CI: 1.03 to 7.87) and two abnormal values on the 6-week postpartum 75 g OGTT (aOR: 2.95; 95% CI: 1.06 to 11.20) were independently associated with FLD. The combined presence of abnormal OGTT values from both periods showed the strongest association with FLD (aOR: 3.04; 95% CI: 1.03 to 13.99), demonstrating high specificity (95.3%) but low sensitivity (13.6%). Elevated glucose levels from the antepartum 100 g OGTT and the 6 week postpartum 75 g OGTT were associated with FLD at 1 year postpartum in women with a history of GDM.

As rates of obesity, chronic hypertension, and advanced maternal age continue to rise, the burden of HDP is expected to escalate. This review provides a comprehensive overview of HDP, encompassing updated classification systems, risk factors, and diagnostic approaches, including emerging biomarkers and predictive imaging tools. We highlight the complex pathophysiology involving impaired placentation, angiogenic imbalance, immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications. Current management strategies are discussed alongside evolving therapeutic interventions, including low-dose aspirin, statins, and novel agents such as hydrogen sulfide donors and C-type natriuretic peptide. Special emphasis is placed on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities that contribute to disproportionate outcomes, particularly among Black and Indigenous women. We also explore the role of personalized medicine, predictive models, and digital health tools in transforming HDP care. By integrating mechanistic insight with public health strategies and clinical innovation, this review aims to inform multidisciplinary approaches to reduce the burden of HDP and promote equitable maternal and neonatal outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Genital herpes in pregnancy is treated with nucleoside analog drugs such as acyclovir to reduce the risk of mother-to-neonate transfer of the virus. Pritelivir is a novel anti-herpes simplex virus drug that is effective against acyclovir-resistant viral strains and is currently in phase 3 clinical trial for nonpregnant subjects. Here, we determined bidirectional transfer of pritelivir across dually perfused term human placental lobule and its effect on placental tissue viability and functionality ex vivo. We also assessed potential cytotoxicity of pritelivir in vitro using human choriocarcinoma-derived trophoblast-like cells (BeWo, b30 clone) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Our data demonstrated the transfer of pritelivir across the placenta ex vivo from the maternal to the fetal circuit and vice versa. Clearance index of pritelivir (ie, the transfer of pritelivir normalized to the transfer of a freely diffusible reference compound antipyrine) in the fetal-to-maternal direction (0.98 ± 0.07, n = 9) exceeded its clearance index in the maternal-to-fetal direction (0.86 ± 0.08, n = 9, P = .006), suggesting involvement of mechanisms other than diffusion in the placental disposition of this drug (possibly, efflux membrane transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein that accept pritelivir as a substrate in vitro). Although our data suggested plausible fetal exposure to the drug, pritelivir did not affect the production of lactate, the consumption of glucose and oxygen, and the release of human chorionic gonadotropin from the perfused placental tissue, indicating its favorable safety profile. Moreover, pritelivir did not alter the viability of the tested cells in vitro. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Preclinical data on placental disposition of pritelivir are crucial to advance the development of this novel antiherpetic drug for its use in pregnancy. The results revealed bidirectional transfer of pritelivir across dually perfused term human placenta ex vivo. Although fetal exposure to the drug is plausible, pritelivir did not impact the viability and functionality of the placenta. Higher transplacental transfer of pritelivir in the fetal-to-maternal direction rather than maternal-to-fetal direction suggested the involvement of placental membrane transporters.",

  "abstract": "Insufficient data exists regarding the trade-off between the survival benefits of exercise in patients with ovarian cancer (OC) and the potential risks associated with increased particulate matter (PM) exposure during physical activity (PA). This study included 822 individuals newly diagnosed with OC. The total PA and subtypes (occupational [OPA], traffic [TPA], household [HPA], leisure-time [LTPA]) were assessed for the year preceding diagnosis using the Physical Activity Questionnaire of the China Kadoorie Biobank. The residential average PM concentrations 1-year before the date of OC diagnosis were assessed by random forest models at a 1 km × 1 km resolution. The comprehensive exposure to three types of PM was evaluated using a PM score (PMS). In addition, we further examined interaction of PMS with different types of PA on OC survival. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to determine hazard ratios (HRs) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Through a median follow-up of 44.95 months, 373 deaths were documented. The highest tertile of the total PA (HR = 0.68, 95 %CI = 0.53, 0.87), TPA (HR = 0.66, 95 %CI = 0.47, 0.95), HPA (HR = 0.41, 95 %CI = 0.25, 0.67), and LTPA (HR = 0.02, 95 %CI = 0.01, 0.05) showed improved overall survival (OS) compared with the lowest tertile, OPA decreased OS (HR = 1.50, 95 %CI = 1.17, 1.92). Additionally, a 34 % reduction in OC survival was observed with each standard deviation rise in PMS (95 %CI = 1.10, 1.63). Notably, OPA intensified PMS-related OS reductions, while total PA, HPA, and LTPA attenuated this association. We revealed that joint exposure to comprehensive PM was significantly linked to decreased OS of patients with OC, particularly for those primarily engaged in OPA. However, the long-term benefits of total PA, HPA, and LTPA may ameliorate the adverse effects of comprehensive PM exposure during PA.",

  "abstract": "An enlarged urogenital hiatus is as important as apical support or fascial attachment failures in the development of prolapse and is strongly related to operative failure, yet we lack a conceptual model for factors responsible for hiatal failure. For a conceptual model to be valid, it cannot be proven false by empirical observation. We present six clinical observations with which future model development must be consistent. (1) Perineal body damage alone does not explain an enlarged urogenital hiatus. Three women have complete 4th degree lacerations but small hiatuses. (2) Levator damage is not a sole causal factor. One woman has bilateral levator avulsion but a normal hiatus, while another has intact muscles and an enlarged hiatus. (3) Hiatal assessment during straining is incomplete. Two women with similar straining urogenital hiatuses of 6-7 cm have respective 1.5 cm and 7 cm resting hiatuses. (4) Urogenital hiatus measurements during straining are confounded by Valsalva effort strength. Urogenital hiatus size increases by 30%, 51%, and 181% in one woman depending on straining strength. (5) Hiatal closure during pelvic muscle contraction differs widely. One woman can close her hiatus from 3.5 cm to 1.5 cm, while another shows no reduction despite evidence of contraction. (6) Prolapse/hiatus interactions occur with advancing age. One woman experiences progressive hiatal enlargement over 31 years. Our clinical observations reveal the complexity of the multiple factors involved in hiatal failure and support the need for a unified disease model consistent with these factors on which to base future research.",

Three patients had bacteraemia, two had central line-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), one had bacteraemia and pneumonia, and one had infective endocarditis. Four infections were community-acquired and three were healthcare-associated. All patients survived. Although rare, G. adiacens can cause severe infections in children.

  "abstract": "Clostridium innocuum, a member of the human gut microbiome with intrinsic resistance to vancomycin, has been increasingly associated with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Clinical observations indicate that co-infection with Clostridioides difficile and C. innocuum could lead to poorer clinical remission in ulcerative colitis; however, the pathogenic mechanism of C. innocuum remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of vancomycin and C. difficile on C. innocuum secretomes and the functions of the modified secretomes on C. innocuum pathogenicity. The results indicated that, compared to co-culturing with C. difficile, vancomycin was more effective in stimulating the secretion of proteins without a signal peptide, whereas C. difficile was better at promoting the secretion of classical secretory proteins. Based on these results, we further analyzed the effects of three abundant classical secretory proteins on C. innocuum virulence utilizing recombinant proteins. The results demonstrated that the NlpC/P60-containing protein (NlpC/P60) can enhance C. innocuum biofilm formation and adherence to HT-29 cells. Additionally, NlpC/P60, D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase, and a polysaccharide deacetylase were able to stimulate IL-8 production of HT-29 cells and TNF-α production of Raw264.7 macrophages. Additionally, recombinant NlpC/P60 and polysaccharide deacetylase exhibited cytotoxicity on Raw264.7 cells at 48 h. As the production of IL-8 and TNF-α is closely associated with IBD development, it is suggested that C. innocuum secretomes, under the influence of vancomycin or C. difficile, could contribute to IBD progression by enhancing inflammation and host-pathogen interactions.",

  "abstract": "Research of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM), two acquired chronic illnesses affecting mainly females, has failed to ascertain their frequent co-appearance and etiology. Despite prior detection of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) activation in these diseases, the potential biomarker value of HERV expression profiles for their diagnosis, and the relationship of HERV expression profiles with patient immune systems and symptoms had remained unexplored. By using HERV-V3 high-density microarrays (including over 350k HERV elements and more than 1500 immune-related genes) to interrogate the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from female patients diagnosed with ME/CFS, FM, or both, and matched healthy controls (  = 43), this study fills this gap of knowledge. Hierarchical clustering of HERV expression profiles strikingly allowed perfect participant assignment into four distinct groups: ME/CFS, FM, co-diagnosed, or healthy, pointing at a potent biomarker value of HERV expression profiles to differentiate between these hard-to-diagnose chronic syndromes. Differentially expressed HERV-immune-gene modules revealed unique profiles for each of the four study groups and highlighting decreased γδ T cells, and increased plasma and resting CD4 memory T cells, correlating with patient symptom severity in ME/CFS. Moreover, activation of HERV sequences coincided with enrichment of binding sequences targeted by transcription factors which recruit SETDB1 and TRIM28, two known epigenetic silencers of HERV, in ME/CFS, offering a mechanistic explanation for the findings. Unexpectedly, HERV expression profiles appeared minimally affected in co-diagnosed patients denoting a new nosological entity with low epigenetic impact, a seemingly relevant aspect for the diagnosis and treatment of this prevalent group of patients.",

For example, health information and behaviors, such as HIV-related prevention and care, may disseminate within a network or across society. By harmonizing egocentric and digital networks, researchers may construct a sociocentric-like \"fuzzy\" network based on a subgroup of the population. We aimed to generate a more complete sociocentric-like \"fuzzy\" network by harmonizing alternative sources of egocentric and digital network data to examine relationships between participants in the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) cohort study. Further, we examined network peer effects of the status-neutral HIV care continuum cascade. Data were collected from January 2018 to December 2019 in Chicago, Illinois, United States, from a community health center and via peer referral sampling as part of the N2 cohort study, comprised of Black sexually minoritized men and gender expansive populations. Participants provided sociodemographics, social networks, sexual networks, mobile phone contacts, and Facebook friends list data. Lab-based information about the HIV care continuum cascade was also collected. We used an experimental approach to develop and test a fuzzy matching algorithm to construct a more complete network across social, sexual, phone, and Facebook networks using R and Excel. We calculated social network centrality measures for each of these networks and then described the HIV care continuum within the context of each network. We then used Spearman correlation and a network autocorrelation model to examine social network peer effects with HIV status and care engagement. A total of 412 participants resulted in 2054 network connections (ties) across the confidant and sexual partner social networks (participants=387; ties=445), peer referral network (participants=412; ties=362), phone contacts (participants=273; ties=362), and Facebook network (participants=144; ties=1383), reaching the entire study sample in one fully connected \"fuzzy\" network. Results from the individual networks' autocorrelation model suggest there are no peer effects on status-neutral HIV care engagement. Results from the final fuzzy-like sociocentric network autocorrelation model, adjusted for HIV serostatus, suggest that participants who were proximate to network members engaged in HIV care were significantly more likely to be engaged in care (ρ=0.128, SE 0.064; P=.045). Using alternative sources of network data allowed us to fuzzy match a more complete network: fuzzy matching may identify hidden ties among participants that were missed by examining alternative sources of network data separately. Although sociocentric studies require significant resources to implement, more complete sociocentric-like networks may be generated using a fuzzy match approach that leverages egocentric, peer referral, and digital networks. Enriching offline networks with digital network data may provide insights into characteristics and norms that egocentric approaches may not be able to capture.",

  "abstract": "High-resolution metabolomics has shown promise for identifying blood-based biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB). We sought to discover a metabolic signature to detect pulmonary TB disease and monitor treatment response. Plasma from Ethiopian persons with pulmonary TB at diagnosis (n=82) was compared to household contacts with TB symptoms (n=104) and 2, 6, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Participants were divided into training and test sets for model building, with additional validation using independent cohorts from the countries of Georgia (n=89) and South Africa (n=85). Signatures were further evaluated in non-human primates infected with M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Among the metabolites that most significantly differed in concentration, tryptophan and retinol were significantly decreased in persons with TB disease (45.2 uM vs 62.5 uM and 4.1 uM vs 8.2 uM respectively), while kynurenine was significantly increased (2.1 uM vs 1.6 uM; q<0.0001 for all). A signature that included the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and retinol showed excellent classification for TB disease (AUC=0.97). The signature had an AUC of 0.97 in HIV+ and 0.95 in HIV- persons with TB disease from South Africa and 0.93 in TB patients from Georgia. In Ethiopian participants, signature scores decreased after 2 (0.85 to 0.42) and 6 months of TB treatment (0.42 to 0.18; p<0.0001 for both) to similar levels as controls. Plasma retinol also declined in NHPs infected with Mtb 15-16 weeks after infection (5.9 uM vs 3.6 uM; p<0.001). The plasma Kyn/Trp ratio and retinol represents a promising metabolic signature that could advance TB diagnostics.",

In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to investigate this and understand stigma and awareness among fatty liver disease patients. A semi-structured interview consisting of questions was carried out with patients to get an understanding of their knowledge of fatty liver disease and their opinions on the terminology used for its diagnosis. Surveys were completed by 222 fatty liver disease patients in a written questionnaire. Out of the participants, only 84 (37.8%) and 37 (16.7%) of patients believed that cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma might result from fatty liver disease, while 82 (36.9%), 87 (39.2%), and 52 (23.4%) of patients thought fatty liver was connected to diabetes or cardiovascular disease. 189 individuals (85.1%) said that including the word \"alcohol\" in the name of a condition carries a stigma. Conversely, 177 (79.7%) of participants said that they do not consider the term \"fatty\" to be stigmatizing. Additionally, the degree of awareness of the disease's consequences seems very low. 159 (71.9%) and 180 (81.1%) participant expressed their lack of knowledge on how the disease can be diagnosed or treated, respectively, and 146 (65.8%) of the participants showed a desire to acquire knowledge about the impact of fatty liver disease on their well-being and health. A part of our concern about fatty liver disease awareness without trivialization. The use of the word \"fat\" in the nomenclature of fatty liver disease linked with metabolic dysfunction is not perceived to be stigmatizing. The suggested change to MASLD does not seem warranted, at least if the stigma is the main concern.",

  "abstract": "Poliomyelitis is an acute infectious disease caused by poliovirus in childhood. After the onset of acute poliomyelitis, weakness of limbs occurs 15 to 30 years later, which is defined as post-polio syndrome. Poliomyelitis accompanying head and neck cancer is rare. Microvascular reconstruction is a well-established procedure following extensive tumor resection. Donor-site selection for flap harvest is a very important issue in paralyzed patients, particularly in patients with post-polio syndrome. To date, limited information is available regarding flap harvest in paralyzed patients. We present a case of a 70-year-old male who presented with oral squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with both lower extremities paralyzed due to childhood poliomyelitis. Reconstruction was successfully performed with an anterolateral thigh flap despite extensive muscle atrophy. The sizes of the vascular pedicle and the cutaneous perforators were anatomically similar to the ones of healthy limbs. Both donor and recipient sites healed uneventfully; however, a postoperative complication due to pneumonia occurred. The present case demonstrates that flap harvest from paralyzed limbs in post-polio syndrome is safe, which is in line with the sparse evidence from the literature. However, our attention should be drawn to postoperative respiratory complications and management. In order to avoid postoperative complications, it is essential to undertake a precise preoperative assessment.",

People living in malaria-endemic areas gradually develop resistance to symptomatic malaria and control both parasite numbers and the inflammatory response. We previously found that adaptive NK cells correlated with reduced parasite load and protection from symptoms. We also found that murine NK cell production of IL-10 protected mice from experimental cerebral malaria. Human NK cells can also secrete IL-10, but it is unknown what NK cell subsets produce IL-10 or if this is affected by malaria experience. We hypothesized that NK cell immunoregulation may lower inflammation and reduce fever induction. Here, we showed that NK cells from participants with malaria experience make significantly more IL-10 than participants with no malaria experience. We then determined the proportions of NK cells that are cytotoxic and produce IFN-γ and/or IL-10 and identified a signature of adaptive and checkpoint molecules on IL-10-producing NK cells. Lastly, we found that coculture with primary monocytes, Plasmodium-infected RBCs, and antibody induced IL-10 production by NK cells. These data suggest that NK cells may contribute to protection from malaria symptoms via IL-10 production.",

  "abstract": "Severe asthma in children is notoriously difficult to treat, and its immunopathogenesis is complex. In particular, the contribution of T cells and relationships to antiviral immunity remain enigmatic. Here, we coupled deep phenotyping with machine learning methods to elucidate the dynamics of T cells in the lower airways of children with treatment-refractory recurrent wheeze, and examine rhinovirus (RV) as a driver. Our strategy revealed a T cell landscape dominated by type 1 and type 17 CD8+ signatures. Interrogation of phenotypic relationships coupled with trajectory mapping identified T cell migratory and differentiation pathways spanning the blood and airways that culminated in tissue residency, and involved transitions between type 1 and type 17 tissue-resident types. These dynamics were reflected in cytokine polyfunctionality. Use of machine learning tools to cross-compare T cell populations that were enriched in the airways of RV-positive children with those induced in the blood following experimental RV challenge precisely pinpointed RV-responsive signatures that contributed to T cell migratory and differentiation pathways. Despite their rarity, these signatures were also detected in the airways of RV-negative children. Together, our results underscore the aberrant nature of type 1 immunity in the airways of children with recurrent wheeze, and implicate an important viral trigger as a driver.",

The majority of alterations identified in these regions remain unclassified, but evidence of the impact of variants in the regulatory regions on cancer risk and response to treatment is emerging. This project aimed to investigate the prevalence of germline variants in the non-coding regulatory regions of BRCA1/2 and other BC predisposition genes in patients with triple-negative BC (TNBC) selected for age at cancer diagnosis and/or family history of cancer. The study also aims to investigate the relationship between these variants and clinical outcomes such as overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and response to treatment. We analyzed a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) custom panel of promoter regions of 28 genes involved in BC predisposition on 144 patients with TNBC previously tested wild type for coding regions of BRCA1/2. The NGS analysis identified 635 rare variants in promoter regions of the 28 genes. Among the 144 patients, for 75 with available clinical data, rare germline variants in BRCA2 promoter were statistically significantly related to worse overall survival (OS) (P-value = .017). No differences in DFS and OS were found for the other genes. Rare variants in the CDH1 promoter were related to the highest percentage of non-pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = .0273); MLH1 and PALB2 rare non-coding variants were found to be both related to bilateral BC (P = .0146 and P = .0005, respectively) and ATM promoter variants were associated with a positive family history (P = .041). Our results underscore the importance of searching for rare germline variants in regulatory regions of cancer predisposition genes in patients with TNBC, since these variants can be associated with an increased cancer risk.",

  "abstract": "Intersystem medical error discovery (IMED) involves clinicians identifying errors that occurred outside of their facility while a patient was under another clinician's care. Despite its major implications for safety and quality of care, explicit guidance is limited. Given the complexity of disorders and specialization within otolaryngology, IMED is a considerable concern, yet little is known about current practices or management strategies. To explore otolaryngologists' perceptions and practices around feedback and reporting of IMED and to identify strategies for preventing or responding to these errors. This qualitative study used semistructured, virtual interviews of 24 otolaryngologists with expertise in patient safety and quality improvement across the US from July to October of 2023. Purposive sampling ensured diversity in subspecialty, career stage, geography, practice context, and demographics. Otolaryngologist perceptions of IMED, encompassing barriers and facilitators to providing feedback or reporting IMED, and strategies for improving practices. Analysis followed an iterative inductive approach of interpretive description. Among the 24 participants (median [IQR] age, 51 [43-59] years; 13 [54%] female), several barriers, facilitators, and strategies emerged. Barriers included logistical (eg, lack of proximity, unavailable contact information, time constraints), psychosocial (eg, interpersonal discomfort, fear of retaliation, burnout), and structural factors (eg, fragmented systems, lack of incentives, leadership modeling, perceived conflict of interest). Facilitators that were associated with increased feedback or reporting included severe, egregious, fraudulent, or repetitive errors and preexisting relationships with the involved clinician. Most participants believed that IMED was inadequately addressed, with proposed strategies encompassing feedback training, standardized guidelines, interoperable medical records, oversight by national or state bodies, and intersystem safety reporting mechanisms. This qualitative study shows that the absence of standardized processes and resources hampers effective responses to IMED, such as feedback and reporting. While egregious errors or preexisting relationships may trigger action, opportunities exist to enhance clinical practice and policies across health systems.",

Anti-TNF injection has undergone phase 2 trials and may be effective in slowing early-stage disease progression. Here we sought to determine how new synthesis of type I collagen in Dupuytren's differs from normal palmar fascia samples and to analyze the role of TNF in aberrant collagen synthesis. Model nonfibrotic but fibrous connective tissues were used to analyze active type I collagen protein synthesis in development, aging, and degenerative disease, where it was restricted to early development and ruptured tissue. Dupuytren's tissue was shown to actively synthesize type I collagen, including abnormal type I collagen homotrimer. TNF-α reduced COL1A2 gene expression only in the presence of serum in 2D cell culture and had opposing effects on collagen protein production in the presence or absence of serum. TNF-α had only limited effects in 3D tendon-like constructs. Anti-TNF did not reduce type I collagen synthesis in 3D tendon-like constructs or prevent type I collagen homotrimer synthesis in Dupuytren's tissue. Hence, modulation of the TNF-α pathway in Dupuytren's disease is unlikely to prevent the pathological collagen accumulation that is characteristic of fibrosis.",

In recent years, AS-IV has attracted considerable attention for its hepatoprotective properties, which are attributed to its low toxicity as well as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumour effects. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated its potential in the prevention and treatment of various liver diseases, including multifactorial liver injury, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. Given the promising hepatoprotective potential of AS-IV and the growing interest in its research, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research on the hepatoprotective effects of AS-IV, based on literature available in databases such as CNKI, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Web of Science. The hepatoprotective mechanisms of AS-IV are multifaceted, encompassing the inhibition of inflammatory responses, reduction of oxidative stress, improvement of insulin and leptin resistance, modulation of the gut microbiota, suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and induction of tumour cell apoptosis. Notably, key molecular pathways involved in these effects include Nrf2/HO-1, NF-κB, NLRP3/Caspase-1, JNK/c-Jun/AP-1, PPARα/FSP1 and Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin. Toxicity studies indicate that AS-IV has a high level of safety. In addition, this review discusses the sources, physicochemical properties, and current challenges in the development and clinical application of AS-IV, providing valuable insights into its potential as a hepatoprotective agent in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.",

  "abstract": "Patients with viral myocarditis (VMC) exhibit evident autonomic nervous system imbalance, and adverse cardiac remodeling is involved in impaired cholinergic function. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), which is a neurotransmitter receptor, exerts immunoregulatory effects. Recent advances have illuminated the evolution and functions of peripheral and cardiac B cells in heart disease. However, the role of α7nAChR expressed by B cells in the progression of VMC has not been established. We revealed the neuroimmune communication landscape in the heart and found that the phenotypes of cardiac and splenic B cells and their α7nAChR expression changed dynamically during the progression of VMC to dilated cardiomyopathy. α7nAChR on B cells serves as a negative regulator by inhibiting their proinflammatory functions and signaling pathways. B cell-specific α7nAChR deficiency exacerbated myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. However, these effects were abrogated in non-B cells from mice with IL-17A knockdown. Enhanced degradation of acetylcholine leads to an imbalance in cholinergic signaling, resulting in impaired neurotransmission. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide could improve cardiac remodeling and prevent the progression of VMC to the chronic phase, which was partly dependent on the α7nAChR on B cells. Our findings provide notable insights into cardiac-neural-immune communication during myocardial injury.",

  "abstract": "Cervical gunshot injuries, although rare, carry a significant risk of vertebral artery injuries (VAIs), which can lead to complex neurological and vascular complications. Effective management requires individualized strategies tailored to the clinical presentation and associated injuries. This study presents three cases of civilian cervical gunshot wounds involving VAIs and reviews the literature to highlight optimal management approaches. Three male patients, aged 24, 41, and 44, presented with cervical gunshot wounds and varying degrees of spinal cord and vertebral artery injuries. Two patients were managed conservatively with close monitoring, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care due to the absence of progressive neurological deficits or active bleeding. The third patient underwent emergency surgical decompression and vertebral artery clipping to control massive hemorrhage and prevent further neurological deterioration. Where feasible, endovascular treatment was prioritized due to its lower complication rates compared to open surgery. Follow-up revealed diverse outcomes, ranging from paraplegia to quadriparesis, highlighting the variable presentations and long-term consequences associated with these injuries. The third patient developed a delayed arteriovenous fistula (AVF) two years post-injury, which was successfully treated with endovascular embolization. Civilian cervical gunshot injuries involving the vertebral artery require individualized treatment plans. Conservative management may be appropriate for clinically stable cases, while surgical or endovascular interventions are crucial for managing vascular instability or progressive neurological deficits. Long-term follow-up is essential to detect and address delayed complications such as pseudoaneurysms or AVFs. This case series underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, involving neurosurgery, vascular surgery, otolaryngology, and interventional radiology, to optimize outcomes and deliver comprehensive care.",

Participants were categorized as exhibiting good adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC] ≥ 0.8) or poor adherence (PDC < 0.8) to antihypertensive medication during the first year of treatment. We investigated the associations of demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors with good medication adherence based on logistic regression analysis. Only 43.3% (  = 61,107) of young adults with hypertension showed good adherence to antihypertensive medication. Male sex, older age, higher income, urban residence, non-smoking, and higher physical activity were associated with good medication adherence. Initial combination therapy, especially with single-pill combination (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.18), was associated with good adherence. Among patients under monotherapy, initial use of renin-angiotensin blockers (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 4.47-6.15) or calcium-channel blockers (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 3.47-4.78) was associated with better adherence than initial diuretics. Although antihypertensive medication adherence is generally poor among young adults, we identified potential demographic and clinical factors associated with good adherence to antihypertensive treatment. Initial use of a single-pill combination may promote adherence in young patients, and its long-term clinical outcomes warrant further investigation.",

Using TCGA dataset, we identified a gene expression signature reflective of FLOT1 and applied LASSO regression to build a prediction model. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk subgroups based on this signature. The prognostic value was confirmed across three independent cohorts, showing that high-risk patients had significantly poorer overall survival. Cox proportional hazards models were used to establish this gene signature as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HNSCC patients. Additionally, this signature predicted survival outcomes in patients undergoing RT. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that inhibiting FLOT1 expression increased the radiation sensitivity of HNSCC cells by modulating the phospho-PTEN/IGF1R axis. Moreover, silencing FLOT1 decreased radioresistance in radioresistant cell lines and xenograft mouse models. In conclusion, the FLOT1-related gene signature is a strong prognostic marker for HNSCC and may help identify patients who may benefit from RT.",

Driver gene-specific analyses revealed that  -mediated CHIP exerted the strongest effect size on AAA risk (HR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.54-2.88];  <0.001). The presence of 2   p.Asp358Ala alleles attenuated the risk of AAA in large CHIP carriers (HR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.23-0.99];  =0.046). In the joint analysis, participants with CHIP and high genetic risk had a higher risk of developing AAA than those without CHIP and with low genetic risk (HR, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.63-2.85];  <0.001). CHIP is associated with an increased risk of AAA. Genetic IL-6 signaling deficiency attenuates the risk of AAA in large CHIP carriers. CHIP may serve as an attractive target for the prevention and treatment of AAA.",

  "abstract": "The exhausted CD8  T (T ) cells consist of distinct subsets including Tcf1  stem-like, Tcf1 Cx3cr1  intermediate (T -int) and Tcf1 Cx3cr1  terminally exhausted cells; yet, epigenetic determinants of T  subset differentiation remain incompletely understood. Using chronic viral infection, we show that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) was specifically required for the formation of antigen-specific T -int cells at the effector phase of responses. Single-cell transcriptomics validated that Hdac1 deficiency depleted T -int cells and revealed that Hdac1 was critical for positive regulation of T -int-characteristic genes, including  ,  , and  . Furthermore, profiling chromatin accessibility landscape in T  subsets demonstrated that loss of Hdac1 resulted in a prevalent increase in chromatin open state, as evidently observed at the exhaustion program genes, which were linked to induced expression of exhaustion-inducing Tox transcription factor, PD1 and Lag3 coinhibitory receptors in T  cells. Hdac1 thus has dual regulatory functions: promoting T -int cell fate and preventing excessive activation of the exhaustion program to curtail uncontrolled virus replication.",

  "abstract": " Distress, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, is associated with lower cognitive function and higher use of medications, including sleep aids, opiate pain relievers, and minor tranquilizers. Whether use of these medications is linked to lower cognitive function, and whether such medication use might partially explain the relationship between distress and cognition remains unclear. Using data from 10,653 women in the Nurses' Health Study II, we assessed associations between distress and past-month medication use; medication use and cognitive function; and whether medication use mediates the distress-cognitive function relationship.   Distress was defined using validated measures of PTSD and depression. To consider possible joint effects of experiencing both forms of distress, we derived a continuous, standardized distress score including symptoms of both PTSD and depression, and a six-level categorical variable indicating the presence/absence of trauma, PTSD, and depression. Past-month medication use was self-reported. Cognitive function was measured with the Cogstate Brief Battery, yielding composite score measures of psychomotor speed/attention and learning/working memory. We fit linear regression models for continuous outcomes, logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes, and conducted causal mediation analysis using a counterfactual framework.   Higher distress was associated with use of all three medications (e.g., a 1-standard-deviation higher continuous distress score was associated with 1.5 times the adjusted odds of past-month opiate use [95% confidence interval: 1.40, 1.60]). Associations between past-month medication use and cognitive function were mixed.   We did not find clear evidence of mediation by medication use, suggesting that distress may influence cognitive function   other pathways.",

  "abstract": "Molluscum contagiosum is an infectious skin disease caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus that affects 6 million people in the United States annually. However, molluscum contagiosum on the eyelid is uncommon. The aim of this article is to describe the clinical diagnosis and effect of curettage using fine forceps under an operating microscope in a patient with eyelid molluscum contagiosum. We reported a patient who presented with a two-month long history of a dome-shaped skin-colored papule with a central umbilication containing white caseous material on the left upper eyelid margin. The patient underwent a complete curettage using fine forceps under an operating microscope. Postoperative histopathology revealed Henderson-Patterson bodies. A diagnosis of eyelid molluscum contagiosum was made. At the 1-week follow-up, his symptoms had resolved completely without scarring. No recurrence was observed at a nine-month follow-up. This novel surgical method may be beneficial and safe for patients with eyelid molluscum contagiosum. Slit-lamp examination is a noninvasive and valuable tool for evaluating this condition. Typical pathological features may help in the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and precise treatment can prevent reinfection and control transmission. This report is particularly relevant to dermatologists and ophthalmologists because it offers valuable insights into a rare localization of molluscum contagiosum and its treatment approach.",

Genetic diagnosis can eliminate unnecessary tests and ensure appropriate follow-up and treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the etiology of CC without known etiological reasons in 10 families using whole exome sequencing (WES).MethodsTen families participated in this study, with all patients undergoing comprehensive ophthalmological, metabolic, and genetic assessments. DNA samples from the probands were analyzed using WES, and variants were verified and validated through Sanger sequencing.ResultsOf the 10 patients diagnosed with isolated CC, 9 (90%) had bilateral cataracts, and 1 (10%) had unilateral cataract. Nuclear type cataracts were detected in 8 (80%) patients, while polar type cataracts were found in 2 (20%) patients. Parental consanguinity was present in 7 out of the 10 families. An unidentified variant in the   gene (c.491C > G) associated with Martsolf syndrome was found in one patient. Two novel and one previously identified gene variants associated with CC were detected in 3 of the remaining 9 patients: a novel c.463C > T in  , a previously identified c.965dup in  , and a novel c.3330C > A in  .ConclusionThe high rate of consanguineous marriages in Turkey (23.3%) increases the incidence of autosomal recessive (AR) diseases, explaining the higher prevalence of AR CC despite its usual autosomal dominant inheritance.

This study aimed to examine the current research state, frequently utilized research instruments, and factors impacting the oral health quality of life in individuals with diabetes. Our review was conducted according to the PRISMA extended guidelines for scoping review. We conducted a literature review on the oral health and quality of life of diabetic patients using PubMed, Embase, and additional databases. This research proposal has been formally submitted to the Open Science Framework. Out of 3827 materials, merely 17 publications satisfied the review requirements for our study. The search period extended from the inception of the library until Feb 5, 2024. The research encompassed seven countries, including China, the United States, and Iran, utilizing the Oral Health Evaluation Index for the Elderly and the Oral Health Impact Scale as prevalent assessment instruments. The quality of life connected to oral health was predominantly low among diabetic patients, influenced by socio-demographic characteristics, oral health status, biochemical indicators, psychosocial elements, lifestyle choices, and oral-related factors. The oral health-related quality of life among diabetic patients is typically diminished. Oral health care professionals must devise strategies to promptly identify, assess, and manage the factors influencing the oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients, while incorporating necessary preventive measures and screenings to enhance oral disease prevention in routine evaluations.",

  "abstract": "Historically, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (HSD17B3) was thought to be the key enzyme responsible for testicular testosterone production. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in HSD17B3 impair testosterone production during prenatal life leading to impaired development of androgen-dependent tissues in 46,XY individuals. However, male mice with HSD17B3 deficiency exhibit normal testicular testosterone concentrations, normal development of reproductive organs and are fertile, suggesting that mice express other hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes capable of testicular testosterone synthesis. This study aimed to investigate whether 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12), which can convert androstenedione to testosterone in mice but not in humans, compensates for the lack of HSD17B3 in Hsd17b3 knockout (KO) mice. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to substitute the amino acid in mouse HSD17B12 that is responsible for its ability to convert androstenedione to testosterone with the amino acid of the human enzyme that prevents androstenedione being used as a substrate. When this Hsd17b12 mutation was introduced into Hsd17b3 KO mice, males exhibited normal reproductive tracts but reduced testicular testosterone production with a consequential reduction in seminal vesicle weight. This suggests HSD17B12 contributes toward testosterone production in the absence of HSD17B3, but other enzymes must also contribute. We therefore quantified other testicular hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, finding that HSD17B7 mRNA and protein was markedly upregulated in Hsd17b3 KO testes. We confirmed that mouse, but not human, HSD17B7 can produce testosterone in vitro. We conclude that compared to humans, mice exhibit increased plasticity in testosterone production via hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes to support androgen action and male fertility.",

  "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by recurrent episodes that significantly impair disease control and reduce patients' quality of life. Despite its clinical importance, the mechanisms underlying asthma relapse remain poorly understood, and effective strategies to prevent exacerbations are still lacking. An acute allergic asthma relapse mouse model was established using ovalbumin sensitization and challenge. Single-cell transcriptomics was employed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving asthma relapse. Flow cytometry and gene knockout experiments were conducted to validate the findings. We successfully established an acute allergic asthma relapse mouse model. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that T cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are pivotal during asthma relapse, serving as the primary cellular sources of type 2 inflammatory cytokines. Further subcluster analysis identified T-cell subcluster 4 and ILC2 subcluster 0 as the predominant contributors to type 2 cytokine production. Complex intercellular communication networks were observed, with macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells functioning as central signaling hubs. Pseudo-time trajectory analysis highlighted the critical role of ILC2s and the Il1rl1 signaling pathway in asthma relapse. These findings were corroborated by flow cytometry. Il1rl1-deficient mice displayed similar pulmonary inflammation to wild-type mice during the initial asthma episode; however, asthma relapse was significantly attenuated. Mechanistically, Il1rl1 deficiency resulted in a substantial reduction in both the number and functional capacity of ILC2s. The recurrence of acute allergic asthma is driven, at least in part, by ILC2s through Il1rl1 signaling. Genetic ablation of Il1rl1 significantly suppresses asthma relapse, suggesting that targeting Il1rl1 may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing asthma exacerbations.",

  "abstract": "Alcohol consumption may induce multiple disorders, and decreased alcohol consumption has been proved to be effective to reduce the incidence of alcohol-associated diseases and mortality. Pharmacotherapy is the most common option for the management of alcohol problems; however, it suffers from multiple problems. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are therefore of urgent need to change alcohol intake among alcohol users. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which encodes the ALDH2 gene, is an important enzyme in ethanol metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals harboring ALDH2 gene mutations are more likely to present discomfort symptoms and are more susceptible to multiple cancers. It is hypothesized that ALDH2 gene testing may reduce alcohol consumption and the incidence of alcohol-associated disorders among unhealthy alcohol users. A single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial was designed, aiming to recruit 940 unhealthy alcohol users at ages of 18 to 60 years. All participants are randomized into the interventional and control groups, and both groups are given alcohol consumption health education. In addition, blood samples are collected from participants in the interventional group for ALDH2 gene testing, with testing reports issued, while ALDH2 gene testing is not performed in the control group. Changes in alcohol intake, hazardous drinking days, and alcohol-associated adverse events are recorded prior to and post-interventions. The primary outcome is alcohol intake, and the secondary outcomes are hazardous drinking days and alcohol-associated adverse events. This trial will provide strong evidence regarding the impact of ALDH2 gene testing on alcohol use behaviors. The study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration no. ChiCTR2400087726) on 2 August 2024.",

  "abstract": "Migraine ranks as the second-leading cause of global neurological disability, affecting approximately 1.1 billion individuals worldwide with severe quality-of-life impairments. Although adjustable risk factors-including environmental exposures, sleep disturbances, and dietary patterns-are increasingly implicated in pathogenesis of migraine, their causal roles remain insufficiently characterized, and the integration of multimodal evidence lags behind epidemiological needs. We developed a three-step analytical framework combining causal inference, predictive modeling, and burden projection to systematically evaluate modifiable factors associated with migraine. First, two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) assessed causality between five domains (metabolic profiles, body composition, cardiovascular markers, behavioral traits, and psychological states) and the risk of migraine. Second, we trained ensemble machine learning (ML) algorithms that incorporated these factors, with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis quantifying predictor importance. Finally, spatiotemporal burden mapping synthesized global incidence, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) data to project region-specific risk and burden trajectories through 2050. MR analyses identified significant causal associations between multiple adjustable factors (including overweight, obesity class 2, type 2 diabetes [T2DM], hip circumference [HC], body mass index [BMI], myocardial infarction, and feeling miserable) and the risk of migraine (P < 0.05, FDR-q < 0.05). The Random Forest (RF)-based model achieved excellent discrimination (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.927), identifying gender, age, HC, waist circumference [WC], BMI, and systolic blood pressure [SBP] as the predictors. Burden mapping projected a global decline in migraine incidence by 2050, yet persistently high prevalence and DALYs burdens underscored the urgency of timely interventions to maximize health gains. Integrating causal inference, predictive modeling, and burden projection, this study establishes hierarchical evidence for adjustable migraine determinants and translates findings into scalable prevention frameworks. These findings bridge the gap between biological mechanisms, clinical practice, and public health policy, providing a tripartite framework that harmonizes causal inference, individualized risk prediction, and global burden mapping for migraine prevention.",

  "abstract": "WITKOS is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the 15q24.1 - q24.2 region, includeing switch-insensitive 3 transcription regulator family member A (SIN3 A). Its incidence rate is extremely low. According to the current limited global data statistics, only a few cases occur per million population. Most cases concentrate in childhood and adolescence. During this stage, the rapid physiological changes of the body seem to be closely related to the triggering of the disease. Its characteristics include unique facial features, intellectual and motor developmental delay, and short stature. This paper reports a case of WITKOS in a 4-month-old infant caused by large-fragment copy number variation in the 15q24.1 - q24.2 region of the chromosome that encompasses the SIN3 A gene. Gene mutations lead to abnormal functions of key proteins, which subsequently disrupt the normal development and operation of multiple body systems., By summarizing its gene phenotype characteristics, it provides diagnostic and treatment ideas for clinicians to screen for developmentally deviated young children. It is expected to provide more effective treatment options for WITKOS to improve the prognosis of patients. This infant was diagnosed with WITKOS at 4 months of age. Subsequently, the manifestations included a wide forehead, a low nasal bridge, low-set ears, growth and intellectual developmental delay, low muscle tone in the limbs, and feeding difficulties. After early rehabilitation training, the language and motor abilities of this infant have been effectively improved, and currently, the infant can walk and run independently and can say short sentences independently. For children with WITKOS, early diagnosis of the clinical symptoms they exhibit and rehabilitation intervention should be carried out, which can effectively improve the quality of life of the children. This report is the first case of WITKOS caused by a large - fragment deletion, further enriching the case data of WITKOS and highlighting the necessity of strengthening clinical management and monitoring.",

Between February 2024 and September 2024, 20 patients (15 F, 5 M; mean age 46.78 ± 14.34 years) with unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) after total thyroidectomy were recruited. After a first phoniatric visit (T0), all patients were randomly assigned to the Experimental group (A) (which performed non-phonatory exercises for one week in parallel with cortisone therapy) or to the Control group (B) (which undergone cortisone therapy only). At the end of the first week, all patients underwent a second phoniatric visit (T1) and started standard voice therapy. After five voice therapy sessions, a further phoniatric control was performed (T2). During each phoniatric visit, a videolaryngoscopic evaluation with attribution of a score relating to the degree of glottal gap, an acoustic analysis of the voice, a perceptual evaluation, and the collection of maximum phonatory time (MPT) were performed. At the end of the first week (T1), group A achieved a significant improvement in the degree of glottal gap and in the MPT compared to those of group B (P < 0.05). Furthermore, at the end of the therapy (T2), group A obtained statistically lower values of Minimum Frequency (F  Hz) and a statistically significant improvement of the parameter \"Instability (I)\" in the perceptual assessment (Grade-Instability-Roughness-Breathiness-Asthenia-Strain scale). In patients affected by UVFP, the early execution of non-phonatory exercises helps the sphincter function of the larynx and improves the degree of adduction of vocal folds, reduces the phonatory effort, and may prevents the establishment of dysfunctional compensations that the patient may implement in the attempt to increase the intensity of the vocal emission.",

  "abstract": "Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) who develop urinary tract infection (UTI) present differently than the non-SCI population. UTIs can cause loss of quality of life and even lead to life-threatening complications including urosepsis. Challenges in SCI management include distinguishing symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), which occurs often in patients with SCI, and the lack of standardization in UTI diagnosis in SCI. This study aims to set the foundation for the development of a risk score to improve diagnostic accuracy of UTI after SCI. This study will use data from the Veterans Health Administration Corporate Data Warehouse from national outpatient clinics. It will use 2 approaches: (1) a case-control study comparing frequency-matched healthy SCI cases (n=2000) with healthy non-SCI controls (n=2000) to establish a physiologic baseline for vital sign and lab measurements after SCI and (2) a retrospective cohort study of patients with SCI (n=400) to determine the positive predictive value of the baseline vital signs and lab measurements found in step 1, from which a threshold for clinically meaningful UTI after SCI will be established. The study was funded in May 2023, and initial data extraction started in early 2024 and is expected to be completed in 2026. Data extraction, analysis, and results for aim 1 were completed as of manuscript submission. For aim 1, we hypothesize that SCI will be associated with lower temperature, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure when compared with non-SCI controls. SCI will also be associated with higher baseline levels of pyuria and peripheral white blood cells when compared with non-SCI controls. Data extraction for aim 2 will begin in year 1, and analysis and results will be completed in year 2. For aim 2, we hypothesize that pyuria, heart rate, and temperature measurements will have a high positive predictive value for clinically meaningful UTI. Once complete, this study will be the basis for our future work developing a risk score to aid with the diagnosis of UTI after SCI and prevent antibiotic overuse in patients with SCI.

  "abstract": "The therapeutic landscape for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) continues to evolve, raising critical questions about the optimal integration of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to improve patient outcomes. Historically, WBRT has been a cornerstone in PCNSL management, offering effective disease control and relapse prevention. However, the use of high-dose WBRT (HD-WBRT) (≥ 36 Gy), while efficacious, has been associated with significant neurotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients, which has curtailed its long-term applicability. In recent years, high-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) has emerged as a consolidative treatment option, demonstrating efficacy comparable to WBRT, especially in younger patients and those with better performance status, thereby reshaping the therapeutic paradigm. As the therapeutic paradigm shifts, efforts to explore advances in WBRT techniques, such as dose reduction (23.4 Gy) and hyperfractionated protocols, have been aimed at mitigating neurotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. These innovations make WBRT a viable option for carefully selected patient populations. Furthermore, this review explores emerging strategies, including localized radiotherapy, novel therapeutic combinations, and individualized treatment paradigms, while identifying key directions for future research to optimize outcomes for PCNSL patients.",

  "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a major cause of vision loss in older adults. While anti-VEGF therapies have improved management by suppressing abnormal blood vessel growth, a substantial subset of patients show poor functional as well as morphological responses and require frequent injections. Faricimab (Vabysmo®), a bispecific inhibitor targeting VEGF-A and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), has shown promise in achieving more durable disease control. This retrospective study included 48 eyes from 47 nAMD patients previously treated with ranibizumab or aflibercept, who were switched to faricimab due to poor treatment response. Evaluations occurred at four time points, assessing best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraretinal (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF), subretinal pigment epithelium fluid and fibrosis, central subfield thickness (CST), and central subfield volume (CSV) using spectral-domain OCT. Dosing intervals and patient-reported outcomes were also recorded. BCVA improved consistently, with mean logMAR improving from 0.54 to 0.40, reflecting a gain of 1.4 Snellen lines. Dosing intervals extended from a median of 5 to 8 weeks, with over one-third of eyes reaching intervals of 10 weeks or more. Significant reductions in IRF, SRF, CST as well as CSV were observed (p < 0.05) with a quarter of eyes showing no intra- or subretinal fluid at the fourth faricimab injection. Three patients were switched back to their previous anti-VEGF treatment due to a decline in BCVA. The findings suggest Faricimab as an effective option for nAMD patients who respond inadequately to prior anti-VEGF therapies, offering both functional and anatomical improvements. Extended intervals reduce treatment burden, indicating faricimab's potential to enhance disease control and patient quality of life in real-world settings.",

  "abstract": "The field of hernia repair has been revolutionized since the advent of totally extraperitoneal(TEP) repairs. The concept of eTEP(extended view TEP) repairs have further expanded horizons by overcoming the challenges faced in TEP repairs. Although laparoscopic ETEP hernia repairs offer a myriad of advantages, these procedures pose a steep learning curve and may pose complications which maybe difficult to manage. This observational study aims to highlight the complications faced during laparoscopicETEP inguinal hernia repairs at our centre and provide possible solutions for the same. This is a high volume single-centre, single team prospective observational data of patients undergoing laparoscopicETEP inguinal hernia repairs from January2020 to October2023. We reviewed a total of 252 such patients and collected demographic details, co-morbidities, intra-operative complications and post-operative recovery of the patients. We have highlighted the possible complications and recommended trouble-shooting approaches to tackle them. The incidence of intra-operative and early complications like early pneumoperitoneum, injury to brick's artery, injury to inferior epigastric artery, peritoneal rents, urinary retention in our study was 5.15%,1.98%,0.4%,10.32%,1.9% respectively. Late complications like seroma, hematoma, chronic pain showed an incidence of 1.59%,0.4%,1.98% respectively. Our cohort did not have any cases of visceral injury(bowel/bladder) or surgical site infection. It is essential to identify and address complications faced during laparoscopic eTEP repairs to ensure patient safety, improved outcomes, reduced recurrences and surgical site infections. Implementing the suggested strategies may help improve the surgical outcome and in turn post-operative patient well-being and quality of life in patients undergoing eTEP repairs.",

  "abstract": "Lymphoma, a cancer with poor prognosis is a growing global health challenge that encompasses two primary types, Hodgkin (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), each further divided into various subtypes with distinct biological behaviors. Conventional therapeutic strategies include chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit intrinsic cytotoxicity against tumor cells without the need for prior immunization or activation. In this prospective clinical trial, we evaluated the feasibility of allogeneic NK cell therapy in patients with high-risk lymphoma who had a poor prognosis. Each patient received 1 × 107 NK cells/kg infusion without interleukin-2 (IL-2) supplementation. Therapy was tolerated without graft-versus-host-disease, cytokine release syndrome, or neurotoxicity. During the follow-up period, 7 had complete responses (CR) (87.5%) and one case exhibited stable disease (SD) (12.5%). In summary, our investigations support the development of allogeneic NK cellular therapies for advanced lymphoma to overcome chemoresistance. Therapeutic efficacy may be further improved by disrupting the immunosuppressive environment and infusion of exogenous IL-15. This approach presents a promising and pragmatic strategy for managing high-risk lymphoma post-HSCT. Future research should focus on optimizing NK cell dosages and infusion frequency to maximize treatment effectiveness.",

Participants were evaluated at baseline (T0), at 4 (T1) and 8 weeks (T2) for office brachial and central BP, heart rate (HR), lipid profile, body weight, and menopausal symptoms.  : NS supplementation significantly reduced office systolic and diastolic BP in a dose-dependent manner (  < 0.01), with more pronounced reductions at 800 mg/day. Improvements in climacteric symptoms and reduced HR were observed as early as T1, while metabolic parameters, including lipid profile and weight, showed significant changes at T2. Notably, the 800 mg/day dosage group also experienced significant reductions in weight and body mass index. Younger age, more recent menopausal transition, and elevated baseline HR were identified as predictors of a better response to treatment.  : NS supplementation demonstrates significant dose-dependent benefits in reducing office BP and improving metabolic parameters. These findings support the role of NS as an effective complementary therapy in hypertension management in postmenopausal women.",

Studies have shown the potential benefits of early vasopressin use, but there is limited evidence of its clinical utility. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of early vasopressin administration in trauma patients with refractory hemorrhagic shock. This retrospective cohort study included adult trauma patients who received more than one blood product. The primary outcome was 28-day alive and vasopressor-free days. Secondary outcomes included blood product administration, 28-day alive and ventilator-free days, and intensive care unit and hospital length of stay (LOS). Safety outcomes included the incidence of renal replacement therapy, venous thromboembolism, and fluid overload. Overall, 37 patients were included, with seven (19%) in the vasopressin group and 30 (81%) in the norepinephrine group. The study population included primarily male patients (n = 29, 78%) with blunt injuries (n = 24, 65%) and a median Injury Severity Score of 26 [IQR 17.0-34.0]. There was no difference in the primary outcome between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups (median 25.5 [IQR 22.7-26.7] vs 26.2 days [IQR 22.7-26.7], p = .985). All secondary and safety outcomes were similar, except that the vasopressin group was associated with a longer hospital LOS (20 [IQR 18-27] vs. 13 days [IQR 8-20], p = .036). Early vasopressin administration was not associated with a significant difference in 28-day alive and vasopressor-free days.

  "abstract": "The Data-Driven Fasting (DDF) app implements glucose-guided eating (GGE), an innovative dietary intervention that encourages individuals to eat when their glucose level, measured via glucometer or continuous glucose monitor, falls below a personalized threshold to improve metabolic health. Clinical trials using GGE, facilitated by paper logging of glucose and hunger symptoms, have shown promising results. This study aimed to describe user demographics, app engagement, adherence to glucose monitoring, and the resulting impact on weight and glucose levels. Data from 6197 users who logged at least 2 days of preprandial glucose readings were analyzed over their first 30 days of app use. App engagement and changes in body weight and fasting glucose levels by baseline weight and diabetes status were examined. Users rated their preprandial hunger on a 5-point scale. Participants used the app for a median of 19 (IQR 9-28) days, with a median of 7 (IQR 3-13) weight entries and 52 (IQR 25-82) glucose entries. On days when the app was used, it was used a median of 1.8 (IQR 1.4-2.1) times. A significant inverse association was observed between perceived hunger and preprandial glucose concentrations, with hunger decreasing by 0.22 units for every 1 mmol/L increase in glucose (95% CI -0.23 to -0.21; P<.001). Last observation carried forward analysis resulted in weight loss of 0.7 (95% CI -0.8 to -0.6) kg in the normal weight category, 1 (95% CI -1.1 to -0.9) kg in the overweight category, and 1.2 (95% CI -1.3 to -1.1) kg in the obese category. All weight changes nearly doubled when analyzed using a per-protocol (completers) analysis. Fasting glucose levels increased by 0.11 (95% CI 0.09-0.12) mmol/L in the normal range and decreased by 0.14 (95% CI -0.16 to -0.12) mmol/L in the prediabetes range and by 0.5 (95% CI -0.58 to -0.42) mmol/L in the diabetes range. Per-protocol analysis showed fasting glucose reductions of 0.26 (SD 4.7) mg/dL in the prediabetes range and 0.94 (16.9) mg/dL in the diabetes range. The implementation of GGE through the DDF app in a real-world setting led to consistent weight loss across all weight categories and significant improvements in fasting glucose levels for users with prediabetes and diabetes. This study underscores the potential of the GGE to facilitate improved metabolic health.",

  "abstract": "Biomarkers in blood are useful for assessing health and welfare in animals. This study evaluated the agreement among 3 point-of-care testing (POCT) instruments (Seamaty SMT-120VP, Mnchip Pointcare V2/V3, and Zoetis Vetscan VS2 analyzer) on Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. A repeatability study investigated internal measurement variation. In total, 60 plasma samples from adult fish were analyzed simultaneously using different rotors with multiple biomarkers. A comparison between blood and plasma was conducted on 35 blood samples. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient was <0.9 for all analyte comparisons between the 3 POCT except for bile acids; therefore, the McBride strength of agreement was generally poor and was moderate for bile acids. Internal measurement showed a low coefficient of variation for most analytes, except for aspartate aminotransferase (Pointcare V2/V3), alanine transaminase (Pointcare V2/V3), blood urea nitrogen (Pointcare V2/V3), and creatinine (Pointcare V2/V3, SMT-120VP). There was high concordance between whole blood and plasma samples for most analytes on both SMT-120VP and Pointcare V2/V3 systems, except for sodium, total bilirubin, and total CO2. This study underscores the necessity for system-specific calibration and validation of POCT systems like the Seamaty SMT-120VP and Mnchip Pointcare V2/V3 when used in aquaculture for clinical assessment of Atlantic salmon. The reproducibility study demonstrated that the precision of analysis was acceptable for most analytes. The comparison between whole blood and plasma suggests that whole blood can be used on-site to reduce the complexity of analysis. In summary, these systems offer promising tools for rapid on-site health monitoring in salmonid aquaculture but they require validation against gold-standard methods.",

  "abstract": "Sleep is the key factor influencing physical and psychological health. Several factors influence sleep, including lifespan, circadian entrainment, diet, stress, and occupation. Pharmacological (for example, histamine type 1 receptor blockers) and non-pharmacological (for example, cognitive-behavioral therapy) therapeutic approaches are used to alleviate sleep disorders. The gut microbiota has an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep-related disorders. Studies suggested that restoring the healthy gut microbiota could improve sleep quality. Hence, related randomized, blinded, controlled studies were reviewed to know the impact of probiotic supplementation on sleep quality. Altered Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and reduced α-diversity were associated with insomnia, sleep deprivation and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. The literature survey revealed that probiotic supplementation improved healthy subjects' sleep quality and mood states. Probiotic supplementation could improve sleep quality by improving gut microbiota, intestinal integrity, blood- -brain barrier function, brain functions and neurotransmitter regulation. The underlying mechanisms through which probiotic supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on sleep disorders remain unclear. Further research involving a variety of probiotic strains, along with long-term follow-up studies, is needed to validate the potential of probiotics as a complementary therapeutic approach for managing sleep disorders and enhancing sleep quality.",

  "abstract": "To compare the efficacy and safety of four immunosuppressive therapies, either alone or in combination, for primary membranous nephropathy through a network meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Cyclophosphamide (CTX), Cyclosporin (CsA), Tacrolimus (TAC), and Rituximab (RIT) in the treatment of primary membranous nephropathy. Two researchers independently screened articles, extracted data, and evaluated the quality. Outcome indicators included dichotomous variables and continuous variables, which were represented by risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD), respectively. Then, various interventions were ranked according to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). A total of 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included, encompassing 1396 patients. In terms of the overall response rate (ORR), RIT+TAC was superior to CsA (RR = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.54), CTX (RR = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.31), and RIT (RR = 7.06, 95% CI: 2.29, 21.80). The SUCRA value of RIT+TAC was the highest, reaching 93.5%. Regarding the total 24-h urinary protein (24UTP), RIT+TAC was better than RIT (MD = 17.05, 95% CI: 6.49, 44.79), RIT+CTX (MD = 6.99, 95% CI: 2.55, 19.17), TAC (MD = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.18), CsA (MD = 0.06, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.86), and CTX (MD = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.10). The SUCRA value of RIT+TAC was the highest, at 99.4%. For serum albumin, RIT+CTX was superior to CTX (MD = 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.29), and the SUCRA value of RIT+CTX was the highest, at 76.7%. For serum creatinine (Scr), RIT+TAC was better than TAC (MD = 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.13), and CsA was better than TAC (MD = 7.86e+07, 95% CI: 3.65e+06, 1.69e+09). The SUCRA value of RIT+TAC was the highest, at 79.9%. In terms of the incidence of adverse reactions, CTX had a higher rate than RIT+CTX (RR = 11.12, 95% CI: 1.34, 92.15). The SUCRA value of RIT+CTX was the lowest, at 5.3%. In terms of improving ORR, reducing 24UTP and lowering Scr, the RIT+TAC regimen may be the most optimal.

  "abstract": "Primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration plays an important role in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the benefits of such collaboration in patients with stage 5 CKD remain unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD across nine nephrology centers in Japan. The exposure of interest was primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration. We examined the association between primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration and clinical outcomes in adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD: dialysis initiation and cause-specific hospitalizations using the Fine-Gray models, which treat death and preemptive kidney transplantation and death and kidney replacement therapy as competing risk events, respectively. Of the 570 patients included in the analysis, 91 (16.0%) received primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration, whereas the remaining patients were treated by nephrologists alone. During a median follow-up of 1.4 years, 399 (70.0%) patients started dialysis, 11 (1.9%) received preemptive kidney transplantation, and 53 (9.3%) died. There were no significant between-group differences in dialysis initiation and CKD- and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] [95% confidence interval], 0.89 [0.64-1.23], 1.22 [0.78-1.90], and 0.95 [0.46-1.98], respectively). However, primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration was associated with a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization (adjusted SHR [95% confidence interval], 0.36 [0.15-0.87]). Our findings suggest that primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration in the management of stage 5 CKD is not associated with delayed dialysis initiation but is associated with a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization, indicating the potential benefits of primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration in stage 5 CKD.",

  "abstract": "Our pilot study investigated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib (TOF) in patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), providing a new therapeutic option. This was a historical comparator, single-center study. Patients enrolled in our study were screened using the 2016 Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) criteria of MAS. MAS patients deemed suitable for TOF therapy were enrolled in the experimental group. The control group included MAS patients from Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital who had received biological and/or conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/csDMARDs) treatment in a similar period. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, MAS treatment response rates, and glucocorticoid discontinuation rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Serious adverse events such as thrombosis or severe infection were recorded. A total of 36 MAS patients were included-17 in the TOF treatment group and 19 in the b/csDMARDs control group. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. After six weeks, the proportion of febrile patients was significantly lower in the TOF group compared to the control group (11.8% [2/17] vs. 47.3% [9/19], P = 0.021). Significant reductions were also observed in C-reactive protein levels at week 6 (5.9% [1/17] vs. 36.8% [7/19], P = 0.026) and ferritin levels at week 12 (100.0% [17/17] vs. 26.3% [5/19], P = 0.023). The MAS treatment response rate was significantly higher in the TOF group at weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.023, respectively). Glucocorticoid discontinuation was more frequent in the TOF group, with a 12-week discontinuation rate of 100.0% (17/17) compared to 57.9% (11/19) in the control group (P = 0.002). No serious adverse events, including thrombosis or severe infections, were reported. Our results suggest that TOF may be as effective as or even better than b/csDMARDs, with a quicker and higher response rate in patients with MAS without severe adverse events. Key Points •Tofacitinib may be as effective or better than b/csDMARDs in MAS. •Tofacitinib may act at a quicker and higher response rate in MAS. •Tofacitinib might be an alternative therapeutic option for patients with MAS.",

  "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has previously been shown to increase after chemo- and radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer (BC) patients, but the persistence of the increase remains unknown. This study assessed whether changes in mitochondrial respiration and content in PBMCs from postmenopausal BC patients persist up to 1 year after treatment. Thirty-four early-stage BC patients were studied before, shortly after, and six- and twelve-months post-treatment along with 20 healthy controls. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using high-resolution respirometry of intact and permeabilized PBMCs. Mitochondrial content was estimated by quantifying mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear DNA via qPCR. The mitochondrial respiratory capacity of intact and permeabilized PBMCs from BC patients significantly increased after adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy (+ 33% and + 30% for the maximal capacity of the electron transport system, ETS), consistent with previous findings. Importantly, the respiratory capacity returned to pre-treatment levels six months after treatment completion in both intact and permeabilized cells (- 23% and - 26% for the ETS). Healthy controls exhibited similar mitochondrial respiration but had increased mitochondrial content (+ 20%) compared to BC patients before treatment. In summary, chemo- and radiotherapy transiently increased mitochondrial respiration in PBMCs, returning to baseline within six months after treatment completion. This temporary rise in oxygen demand may reflect immune system activation.",

However, no established treatment currently exists. Here we describe a rare case of FGN diagnosed in a patient progressing from monoclonal gammopathy to multiple myeloma. The histopathological findings of the kidney biopsy were consistent with classical FGN and revealed no evidence of myeloma cast nephropathy. Albumin-dominant, Bence Jones protein-negative proteinuria further supported this diagnosis. The patient was successfully treated with anti-myeloma chemotherapies including autologous stem cell transplant, resulting in significant improvement in kidney function. Based on our experience, secondary FGN associated with plasma cell neoplasms may represent a rare entity that responds favorably to anti-myeloma therapies. Initial investigations to rule out coexistent plasma cell neoplasms are crucial for the optimal management of FGN patients.",

  "abstract": "Background and objectives Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its management can adversely affect patients' quality of life and mental health. Many patients are often inadequately informed about their condition and the available treatment options. A considerable number of people with advanced kidney disease have insufficient knowledge about their condition and the available treatment options. This study aims to investigate the impact of an educational intervention on quality of life, psychological resilience, anxiety, and depression. This study specifically aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on variables such as quality of life, psychological resilience, anxiety, and depression. Methods A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients with CKD stage 4-5 to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in improving the aforementioned parameters. Furthermore, the correlation between these outcomes and the level of satisfaction with the intervention was analyzed. Participants were randomized (3:1) into two groups: an educational intervention group (33 patients) and a control group (12 patients). In the intervention group, we performed educational presentations accompanied by a relevant video. Participants completed the questionnaires both before and after the intervention. Participants in the control group were only asked to complete the questionnaires again after the same time period as the intervention group. Results Higher satisfaction with the intervention was significantly associated with a reduction in anxiety (r = -0.38, p = 0.03) and depression scores (r = -0.44, p = 0.01), along with a notable improvement in social functioning (r = 0.40, p = 0.02). Furthermore, a marginally significant positive correlation was observed between the satisfaction scale and psychological resilience (r = 0.32, p = 0.07). Conclusion The level of satisfaction with the intervention is a critical factor in determining its effectiveness. Tailoring the intervention to address the unique needs of each patient may significantly enhance its impact.",

  "abstract": "Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a heterogeneous pattern of glomerular injury. Repeated kidney biopsies may elucidate pathogenic mechanisms and guide diagnostic strategies. We included 82 patients diagnosed with MPGN by kidney biopsy who underwent at least two biopsies between 1997 and 2023 at Peking University First Hospital. Clinical and pathological data were analyzed retrospectively. Of 342 MPGN patients, 95 (28%) had repeated biopsies (0.9-4.0 years apart). This incidence was higher than in other glomerulonephropathies under immunosuppression. Among the 82 patients analyzed (excluding kidney transplants and ≤3-month biopsy intervals), 42 were initially diagnosed with non-MPGN pathology. At the second biopsy, proteinuria increased (from 2.9 to 6.3 g/day), eGFR declined (from 76 to 47 mL/min/1.73 m ), and renal C3 deposition was stronger (  = 0.04). Thirty patients (37%) had etiological reclassification, mostly to monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). Compared to idiopathic MPGN, MGRS patients were older (53 vs. 35 years) and had worse renal function (eGFR 57 vs. 81 mL/min/1.73 m ) but slower eGFR decline (-7 vs. -12 mL/min/1.73 m /year). Most MGRS patients (64%) remained negative for monoclonal protein in serum or urine immunofixation, necessitating repeat biopsy and clone-directed therapy. In this study, about half and one-third of patients underwent morphological and etiological reclassification, respectively. Stronger complement deposition may drive morphological changes. Repeated kidney biopsies are crucial for diagnosing MGRS, especially in patients with negative immunofixation.",

  "abstract": "To analyze the risk factors associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), with the goal of enhancing early diagnosis and treatment, preventing complications, and improving patient outcomes. The study involved 23 pediatric patients with HSP who experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, forming the study group. They were admitted to our hospital from June 2023 to June 2024. For comparison, a control group composed of 44 children with HSP but without gastrointestinal bleeding, admitted during the same timeframe, was established. Data on clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and imaging findings were collected. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify potential risk factors. A total of 67 children with HSP were divided into two groups: those with gastrointestinal bleeding (23 cases) and those without (44 cases). The occurrence of abdominal pain and incidence of intestinal wall thickening detected by gastrointestinal ultrasonography were significantly higher in the group with gastrointestinal bleeding compared to the group without bleeding (  < 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in eight laboratory parameters (WBC, NE, NLR, PCT, CRP, D-dimer, Fib, TT), all statistically significant (  < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified three independent risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding in children with HSP: abdominal pain (OR = 2.334, 95% CI: 0.458-11.886,   = 0.010), a PCT level above 0.12 ng/ml (OR = 10.010, 95% CI: 1.208-82.929,   = 0.033), and a D-dimer level exceeding 1.87 mg/L (OR = 3.407, 95% CI: 1.022-17.473,   < 0.001). The findings confirmed that abdominal pain, elevated PCT levels, and increased D-dimer are significant independent risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Clinicians should monitor these indicators attentively to enhance patient management and outcomes.",

The hospital course was complicated by graft thrombosis. As the patient could not undergo thrombectomy immediately, he underwent temporary HD catheter using ultrasound-guided right internal jugular vein (IJV) cannulation. Post-procedure chest X-ray to confirm this access indicated that this central venous catheter (CVC) was misplaced, with its tip placed into the right axillary vein. This access was not used for HD, and he eventually underwent thrombectomy of the graft and angioplasty of the graft stenosis. The patient later underwent tunneled HD catheter placement under fluoroscopy at the time of thrombectomy, which revealed a torturous superior vena cava, which may indicate why the temporary HD catheter entered the subclavian vein, eventually with its tip at the right axillary vein. This report highlights the crucial importance of radiological confirmation of any CVC placement, especially HD catheters.

  "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The minimally invasive procedure of Laser-assisted Dacryocystorhinostomy (LDCR) has gained importance in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, offering a potential alternative to traditional external and endonasal methods. This is an important topic in otolaryngology practice, as it offers an alternative to traditional endoscopic surgery. Due to the close anatomical proximity of the nose and the eye, addressing it requires collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This study aims to evaluate the surgical effectiveness and factors influencing clinical outcomes. Anatomical issues such as nasal septum deviation and the size of the created ostium were assessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 42 patients were included in the study, undergoing surgery on 46 nasolacrimal ducts. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at least 6 months post-surgery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Anatomic and functional success was achieved in 93.48% of the patients. In patients without septal deviation, there were 35 successful outcomes and 2 failures, compared to 18 successes and 1 failure in the group with septal deviation. The findings revealed no significant correlation between septal deviation and surgical success, indicating that other factors may be more influential. Patients with an average-sized ostium reported better clinical outcomes and fewer tearing symptoms, while those with a deviated septum experienced more intermittent tearing. The overall mean ostium width was 2.37 mm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; LDCR proved effective with a significantly shorter surgical time, benefiting patients seeking a quick recovery. While factors like anatomical abnormalities and septal deviation were not statistically significant for surgical success, patients with anatomical disorders often reported slightly poorer functional outcomes. Analyzing etiological factors and ostium development will help refine surgical techniques and improve patient satisfaction.",

To identify RB1 mosaicism using paired plasma and buffy coat (containing lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and platelets) DNA testing, and to characterize the implications of RB1 mosaicism on cfDNA testing outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, participants with retinoblastoma underwent testing with MSK-ACCESS (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Analysis of Circulating cfDNA to Examine Somatic Status), a clinical assay that combines plasma cfDNA and buffy coat genomic DNA sequencing, enabling the detection and differentiation of somatic, heterozygous, and mosaic variants, between July 2020 and April 2024 at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

Data analysis was performed from April to September 2024. RB1 mosaicism in retinoblastoma. The RB1 variant allele fractions in cfDNA and buffy coat genomic DNA were used to detect RB1 mosaicism. A total of 136 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma (median age at diagnosis, 1.0 year [IQR, 0.4-1.7 years]; 74 [54.4%] female; 67 with bilateral disease and 69 with unilateral disease) who underwent testing with the MSK-ACCESS assay were included. RB1 mosaicism was identified in buffy coat DNA from 20 patients (14.7%), with consistent results detected in all 11 participants tested concurrently by the MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) germline assay. Four participants with RB1 mosaicism previously tested negative for germline RB1 variants by external laboratories. Compared with heterozygous participants, participants with RB1 mosaicism had a lower risk of developing bilateral disease (91.7% vs 55.0%, respectively; difference, 36.7% [95% CI, 13.8%-59.6%]; P = .002). In cfDNA, the mosaicism variant was detected both before and after treatment, with variant allele fraction initially decreasing after treatment but then stabilizing at levels consistent with mosaicism, despite the absence of clinical disease. The accurate detection and quantification of RB1 mosaicism are crucial. RB1 mosaicism should be considered when RB1 variants persist in cfDNA after treatment without evidence of disease; failure to do so may lead to false-positive results and overtreatment in patients with RB1 mosaicism. Identifying RB1 mosaicism may improve patient counseling, inform treatment decisions, and enhance surveillance efforts.",

  "abstract": "Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with various forms of tamponade and retinopexy is often the primary treatment for retinal detachment. However, a rare but serious complication is sterile keratolysis. We therefore aimed to evaluate the prevalence and potential risk factors for the development of corneal ulceration following vitreoretinal surgery for retinal detachment. This is a single-centre retrospective study including 14 cases of patients presenting to our department with sterile keratolysis involving the stroma after one or more PPVs for retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage. Time of primary procedure, time of onset of corneal complications, comorbidities, type of tamponade used, use of endophotocoagulation, cryoretinopexy and number of surgeries were recorded. Patients with additional comorbidities confounding a possible correlation were excluded from the case series. A total of 14 patients were identified with corneal complications after pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment. Multiple vitrectomies were performed in 86% (12/14) of the cases. Surgical treatment consisted of six (43%) perforating keratoplasties and seven (50%) amniotic membrane keratoplasties in all but one patient. At an average of three months after the onset of corneal symptoms, the first corneal surgery was performed. Repeated corneal surgery was required in 4 patients (29%) and consisted of two penetrating keratoplasties and four amniotic membrane transplantation. Visual acuity at the first presentation of corneal complications was reduced (2.1 ± 0.6 logMAR), but was not statistically different from the visual acuity at baseline (1.6 ± 0.7 logMAR). At the last follow-up, visual acuity remained reduced at 1.8 ± 0.8 logMAR (p = 0.2). The risk of sterile keratolysis seems to increase with excessive laser or cryo-retinopexy, use of silicone oil and repeated procedures. The initial vitrectomy was a complex surgery in all cases and required a longer operating time. Ciliary nerve damage of neurotrophic origin may be the cause of sterile keratolysis, and controlled retinopexy sparing the long ciliary nerves and avoiding cryotherapy may reduce the risk. Controlled studies are needed to investigate the causality between vitreoretinal surgery and sterile keratolysis.",

  "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is a major cause of vision loss in older adults. While anti-VEGF therapies have improved management by suppressing abnormal blood vessel growth, a substantial subset of patients show poor functional as well as morphological responses and require frequent injections. Faricimab (Vabysmo®), a bispecific inhibitor targeting VEGF-A and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), has shown promise in achieving more durable disease control. This retrospective study included 48 eyes from 47 nAMD patients previously treated with ranibizumab or aflibercept, who were switched to faricimab due to poor treatment response. Evaluations occurred at four time points, assessing best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraretinal (IRF) and subretinal fluid (SRF), subretinal pigment epithelium fluid and fibrosis, central subfield thickness (CST), and central subfield volume (CSV) using spectral-domain OCT. Dosing intervals and patient-reported outcomes were also recorded. BCVA improved consistently, with mean logMAR improving from 0.54 to 0.40, reflecting a gain of 1.4 Snellen lines. Dosing intervals extended from a median of 5 to 8 weeks, with over one-third of eyes reaching intervals of 10 weeks or more. Significant reductions in IRF, SRF, CST as well as CSV were observed (p < 0.05) with a quarter of eyes showing no intra- or subretinal fluid at the fourth faricimab injection. Three patients were switched back to their previous anti-VEGF treatment due to a decline in BCVA. The findings suggest Faricimab as an effective option for nAMD patients who respond inadequately to prior anti-VEGF therapies, offering both functional and anatomical improvements. Extended intervals reduce treatment burden, indicating faricimab's potential to enhance disease control and patient quality of life in real-world settings.",

Negative correlations were shown between the S, T sectors and total thickness of the pRNFL protocol and MAIA central (C) sector; the N sector and total thickness of the pRNFL protocol and MAIA central temporal (CT) sector.  : RRD leads to a decrease in pRNFL thickness accompanied by reduced macular sensitivity. These changes may be attributed to factors such as the specific location of the RRD, the distribution pattern of the RNFL and the chosen surgical approach.",

  "abstract": "Cardiovascular health (CVH) disparities have been documented among sexual minority adults, yet prior research has focused on individual CVH metrics. We sought to examine sexual identity differences in CVH using the American Heart Association's composite measure of ideal CVH, which provides a more comprehensive assessment of future CVD risk. Data from the All of Us Research Program were analyzed. Sexual identity was categorized as heterosexual, gay/lesbian, bisexual, or other. Individual CVH health metrics and cumulative ideal CVH (range 0-100) were assessed. We ran sex-stratified multiple linear regression models to estimate differences across individual CVH metrics and cumulative ideal CVH between sexual minority and heterosexual adults. We also explored differences in CVH across racial/ethnic and age groups. The sample included 11 047 cisgender adults with a mean age of 61.1 years (± 13.85); 80% were non-Hispanic White. Lesbian women, gay men, and bisexual women reported greater nicotine exposure than their heterosexual counterparts. Compared to heterosexual men, gay men (B [95% CI] = -8.95 [-14.50, -3.39]) had worse physical activity scores. Gay men also had better body mass index scores than heterosexual men (B [95% CI] = 3.21 [0.09, 6.33]). Bisexual women and men had lower cumulative ideal CVH scores than heterosexual adults. Exploratory analyses revealed several differences in individual CVH metrics and cumulative ideal CVH across racial/ethnic and age groups. Clinical interventions to improve the CVH of bisexual adults are needed. Findings can inform the design of interventions that are tailored for specific subgroups of sexual minority adults. Heart disease is the number one cause of death worldwide. Sexual minority (such as gay/lesbian or bisexual) adults are at greater risk of heart disease than straight adults. Our study examined data from the All of Us Research Program. We used a tool from the American Heart Association to measure heart health. We measured 6 different risk factors for heart disease to calculate total heart health scores for each participant. We then compared differences in heart health between sexual minority and straight adults. Our study included 11 047 adults with an average age of 61. Lesbian women, gay men, and bisexual women had higher levels of nicotine use compared to straight adults. Gay men had lower physical activity than straight men but also had a lower risk of obesity. Bisexual women and men had worse total heart health scores than straight adults. We found several differences in heart health across race/ethnicity and age. Our results indicate that interventions to reduce heart disease risk among bisexual women and men are needed. We also provide new knowledge of which racial/ethnic and age groups of sexual minority adults are at highest risk of heart disease.",

  "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The minimally invasive procedure of Laser-assisted Dacryocystorhinostomy (LDCR) has gained importance in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, offering a potential alternative to traditional external and endonasal methods. This is an important topic in otolaryngology practice, as it offers an alternative to traditional endoscopic surgery. Due to the close anatomical proximity of the nose and the eye, addressing it requires collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This study aims to evaluate the surgical effectiveness and factors influencing clinical outcomes. Anatomical issues such as nasal septum deviation and the size of the created ostium were assessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 42 patients were included in the study, undergoing surgery on 46 nasolacrimal ducts. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at least 6 months post-surgery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Anatomic and functional success was achieved in 93.48% of the patients. In patients without septal deviation, there were 35 successful outcomes and 2 failures, compared to 18 successes and 1 failure in the group with septal deviation. The findings revealed no significant correlation between septal deviation and surgical success, indicating that other factors may be more influential. Patients with an average-sized ostium reported better clinical outcomes and fewer tearing symptoms, while those with a deviated septum experienced more intermittent tearing. The overall mean ostium width was 2.37 mm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; LDCR proved effective with a significantly shorter surgical time, benefiting patients seeking a quick recovery. While factors like anatomical abnormalities and septal deviation were not statistically significant for surgical success, patients with anatomical disorders often reported slightly poorer functional outcomes. Analyzing etiological factors and ostium development will help refine surgical techniques and improve patient satisfaction.",

This retrospective research included six homocystinuria patients. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients as age, gender, and comorbidities were collected. Relevant clinical and ophthalmic assessments, like visual acuity, fundus examination findings, complications, and type of surgery were also reported. Six patients with homocystinuria (12 eyes) were included. Associated diseases were mostly mental retardation (100%), epilepsy (66.7%), developmental delay (50.0%), scoliosis (33.3%), bronchiectasis (16.7%), thrombophilia (16.7%), metabolic disorders (16.7%), and deep venous thrombosis (16.7%). All patients had ectopia lentis (100%), while one patient (16.7%) had eye ectropion, one patient (16.7%) had anterior uveitis, and one patient (16.7%) had scleromalacia. Surgery type was mostly lensectomy and vitrectomy (83.3%) then scleral fixation (16.7%), and Grice green procedure (16.7%). There were insignificant differences between first and last Autoref readings in spherical, cylinder, and axis errors of right and left eyes. Late-diagnosed homocystinuria patients frequently have abnormalities of the eyes. Ectopia lentis should always raise the possibility that homocystinuria is the cause of the condition.",

  "abstract": "In this cross-sectional study in Zambia, we examined factors that influence cognitive performance in adults with clade C human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection who were on antiretroviral therapy. We examined if detectable HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in blood plasma, nadir CD4+ T-cell count before antiretroviral therapy, increase in CD4+ T-cell count during antiretroviral therapy, and having pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) influenced cognitive performance. We performed a multilinear regression in which the dependent variable was the global mean cognitive  -score, an overall composite score based on 16 neuropsychological tests that were adjusted for age, sex, and education using normative data from Zambian adults without HIV infection. The 16 tests were merged into seven cognitive domains: Executive Functions, Verbal Fluency, Attention/Working Memory, Learning (immediate recall), Memory (delayed recall), Motor Control, and Speed of Information Processing. When on antiretroviral therapy, a greater increase in CD4+ T-cells was significantly associated with a better global mean cognitive  -score (  = .002). Pulmonary TB was independently associated with worse performance (  = .008). Neither nadir CD4+ T-cell count nor plasma HIV RNA during antiretroviral therapy was associated with cognitive performance. Accounting for CD4+ T-cell increase after antiretroviral therapy initiation and comorbid pulmonary TB may help explain cognitive outcomes in persons with HIV infection in endemic settings. We suggest that it is essential that those with a low CD4+ T-cell count increase the number of cells as early as possible. Our data suggest that this is important for their cognitive functioning. Future research should determine whether the deleterious effect of pulmonary TB resolves after completion of TB treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

  "abstract": "Our pilot study investigated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib (TOF) in patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), providing a new therapeutic option. This was a historical comparator, single-center study. Patients enrolled in our study were screened using the 2016 Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) criteria of MAS. MAS patients deemed suitable for TOF therapy were enrolled in the experimental group. The control group included MAS patients from Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital who had received biological and/or conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/csDMARDs) treatment in a similar period. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, MAS treatment response rates, and glucocorticoid discontinuation rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Serious adverse events such as thrombosis or severe infection were recorded. A total of 36 MAS patients were included-17 in the TOF treatment group and 19 in the b/csDMARDs control group. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. After six weeks, the proportion of febrile patients was significantly lower in the TOF group compared to the control group (11.8% [2/17] vs. 47.3% [9/19], P = 0.021). Significant reductions were also observed in C-reactive protein levels at week 6 (5.9% [1/17] vs. 36.8% [7/19], P = 0.026) and ferritin levels at week 12 (100.0% [17/17] vs. 26.3% [5/19], P = 0.023). The MAS treatment response rate was significantly higher in the TOF group at weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.023, respectively). Glucocorticoid discontinuation was more frequent in the TOF group, with a 12-week discontinuation rate of 100.0% (17/17) compared to 57.9% (11/19) in the control group (P = 0.002). No serious adverse events, including thrombosis or severe infections, were reported. Our results suggest that TOF may be as effective as or even better than b/csDMARDs, with a quicker and higher response rate in patients with MAS without severe adverse events. Key Points •Tofacitinib may be as effective or better than b/csDMARDs in MAS. •Tofacitinib may act at a quicker and higher response rate in MAS. •Tofacitinib might be an alternative therapeutic option for patients with MAS.",

  "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been used to treat gastric cancer, and PD-L1 expression has been identified as a biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer. However, PD-L1 expression prediction for immunotherapy response is inaccurate, and improved response biomarkers are required. Thus, it is important to identify additional biomarkers that can predict the responses to PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in gastric cancer. In this study, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of 142 DEGs co-expressed with PD-L1 were performed, and 41 genes were identified based on the intersection of the mRNA-significant GO term network and the mRNA-significant signalling pathway network. Further intersection analysis of the 41 candidate genes and 137 positive immunotherapy response genes indicated that BATF2 significantly affects the overall survival of GC patients. The transcription factor prediction for BATF2 identified additional potential predictors and therapeutic targets for GC. STAT and IRF family members were predicted to be transcription factors for BATF2. In addition, BATF2 knockdown significantly promoted GC cell growth, and PD-L1 expression was upregulated in si-BATF2-treated MKN-45 cells. Thus, BATF2 may serve as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade therapy in GC. BATF2 acts as a tumour suppressor gene during the development of GC. BATF2 is closely related to PD-L1 expression in GC, and high BATF2 expression positively correlates with low PD-L1 expression. BATF2 can be used as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for responding to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies in GC.",

Stakeholders include physicians, payers, policymakers, regulators and representatives from industry, government, and data privacy sectors. The combination of AI analysis of ocular data with automated technologies that capture images during routine eye examinations enables prescreening of large populations for chronic disease. Retinal images can be acquired during either a routine eye examination or in settings outside of eye care with readily accessible, safe, quick, and noninvasive retinal imaging devices. The outcome of such an examination can then be digitally communicated across relevant stakeholders in a coordinated fashion to direct a patient to screening and monitoring services. Such an approach offers the opportunity to transform health care delivery and improve early disease detection, improve access to care, enhance equity especially in rural and underserved communities, and reduce costs.

In cfDNA, the mosaicism variant was detected both before and after treatment, with variant allele fraction initially decreasing after treatment but then stabilizing at levels consistent with mosaicism, despite the absence of clinical disease. The accurate detection and quantification of RB1 mosaicism are crucial. RB1 mosaicism should be considered when RB1 variants persist in cfDNA after treatment without evidence of disease; failure to do so may lead to false-positive results and overtreatment in patients with RB1 mosaicism. Identifying RB1 mosaicism may improve patient counseling, inform treatment decisions, and enhance surveillance efforts.",

Four participants (1 each with macular atrophy due to congenital rubella, Best macular dystrophy, cuticular drusen with macular atrophy, and Stargardt disease) were studied using adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO), optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography (OCT-A), and microperimetry. Imaging sessions were repeated in three of the four participants. PRL and fixation stability were measured with AOSLO. Fixation stability was compared with healthy participants and participants with RHO- and USH2A-related retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The PRL in participants with eccentric fixation was 0.44 to 1.92 degrees from the anatomic fovea and visual acuity was 20/40 or better. Cones at the PRL were not visible in confocal images, despite normal-appearing and more sensitive cones at greater eccentricities. OCT at the PRL showed intact external limiting membranes but hyporeflective and disrupted inner-segment outer-segment junctions. Fixation stability in participants with eccentric PRLs was no worse than participants with RP, all with foveal PRLs. The eccentric PRL group and the USH2A group with worse visual acuity (20/30 to 20/50) had fixation stabilities that were worse than the healthy controls. Participants adopt eccentric PRLs with hyporeflective cones and reduced sensitivity despite more sensitive and normal-appearing cones at greater eccentricities, suggesting that foveal proximity is prioritized over cone integrity in establishing a PRL. Fixation stability was similar among the four participants with eccentric fixation and those with RP, indicating that small shifts in the PRL from the anatomic fovea in our participants do not make fixation less stable.",

  "abstract": "Tiered trauma activation protocols help physicians prioritize the severely injured but may delay care for those with less severe injuries. While trauma nurse clinicians (TNCs) have been shown to provide efficient trauma care, their impact as primary responders for Level III trauma activations has not been studied. This study aims to evaluate the impact of TNC response to Level III trauma activations on patient outcomes. This pre- and postintervention study was conducted at a Midwestern United States Level I trauma center from July 1, 2023, to October 10, 2023, and included adult and pediatric trauma patients. In July 2022, we implemented a protocol where TNCs replaced physicians responding to Level III trauma activations. Data from the trauma registry and electronic medical records were analyzed before and after implementation. The primary outcome was time to computed tomography within 30 minutes. Secondary outcomes were emergency department (ED) time, hospital length of stay (LOS), and 30-day readmissions. The final analysis included 812 post-intervention patients (562 with TNCs, 250 without TNCs), of which 53% were male. Groups were comparable in age and Injury Severity Score at baseline. Patients seen by TNCs were more likely to receive computed tomography (CT) within 30 minutes (56% vs 35%, p < .0001), while ED and hospital LOS and readmission rates showed no significant difference between groups. This study showed that trauma nurse clinicians' response to third-tiered activations is feasible and improves timely access to CT within 30 minutes, but it showed no effect on ED time, hospital LOS, or hospital readmissions.",

  "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The minimally invasive procedure of Laser-assisted Dacryocystorhinostomy (LDCR) has gained importance in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, offering a potential alternative to traditional external and endonasal methods. This is an important topic in otolaryngology practice, as it offers an alternative to traditional endoscopic surgery. Due to the close anatomical proximity of the nose and the eye, addressing it requires collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This study aims to evaluate the surgical effectiveness and factors influencing clinical outcomes. Anatomical issues such as nasal septum deviation and the size of the created ostium were assessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 42 patients were included in the study, undergoing surgery on 46 nasolacrimal ducts. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at least 6 months post-surgery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Anatomic and functional success was achieved in 93.48% of the patients. In patients without septal deviation, there were 35 successful outcomes and 2 failures, compared to 18 successes and 1 failure in the group with septal deviation. The findings revealed no significant correlation between septal deviation and surgical success, indicating that other factors may be more influential. Patients with an average-sized ostium reported better clinical outcomes and fewer tearing symptoms, while those with a deviated septum experienced more intermittent tearing. The overall mean ostium width was 2.37 mm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; LDCR proved effective with a significantly shorter surgical time, benefiting patients seeking a quick recovery. While factors like anatomical abnormalities and septal deviation were not statistically significant for surgical success, patients with anatomical disorders often reported slightly poorer functional outcomes. Analyzing etiological factors and ostium development will help refine surgical techniques and improve patient satisfaction.",

  "abstract": "Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which the glomeruli of the kidney leak large amounts of protein from the blood into the urine. Most children who present with their first episode of nephrotic syndrome achieve remission with corticosteroids. Children who fail to respond to corticosteroids in the first episode of nephrotic syndrome (initial resistance) or develop resistance after one or more responses to corticosteroids (delayed resistance) may be treated with immunosuppressive agents, including calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporin or tacrolimus), and with non-immunosuppressive agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. However, response to these agents is limited, so newer agents, including anti-CD20 antibodies (rituximab, ofatumumab) and dual endothelin-angiotensin receptor antagonists (sparsentan), are being assessed for efficacy and safety. This is an update of a review first published in 2004 and updated in 2006, 2010, 2016 and 2019. To evaluate the benefits and harms of different interventions used in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, who do not achieve remission following four weeks or more of daily corticosteroid therapy. The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant (CKT) Information Specialist searched the CKT Register of Studies to 28 January 2025 using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared different immunosuppressive or non-immunosuppressive agents with placebo, prednisone or another agent given orally or parenterally in children aged three months to 18 years with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). We included studies that enrolled children and adults, in which paediatric data could not be separated from adult data. Two review authors independently screened the search results, determined study eligibility, assessed risk of bias and extracted study data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. We used a random-effects model to pool data, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The main outcomes of interest were treatment response (complete, partial, or complete or partial remission), kidney failure and adverse events. We included 29 studies (1248 evaluated children). Sixteen studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment. Seven and 21 studies were at low risk of performance and detection bias, respectively. Sixteen, 15 and 15 studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively. Compared with placebo, corticosteroid or no treatment, cyclosporin may increase the number who achieve complete remission (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.09 to 11.20; 4 studies, 74 children) or complete or partial remission (RR 3.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 9.57; 4 studies, 74 children) by two to six months (low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether cyclosporin reduces the likelihood of kidney failure or increases the likelihood of worsening hypertension or infection (very low-certainty evidence). Compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors may increase the number with complete remission (RR 3.43, 95% CI 1.84 to 6.41; 2 studies, 156 children) and complete or partial remission (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.13; 2 studies, 156 children) at three to six months (low-certainty evidence), and probably reduces the number with treatment failure (no response, serious infection, persistently elevated creatinine) and medications ceased due to adverse events (moderate-certainty evidence), with little or no increase in serious infections (moderate-certainty evidence). Kidney failure was not reported. Tacrolimus may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete, or complete or partial remission at six and 12 months compared with cyclosporin, but may reduce the number who relapse during treatment (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.90; 1 study, 34 children) or the number with worsening hypertension (low-certainty evidence). Hypertrichosis and gingival hyperplasia probably increased with cyclosporin. Kidney failure was not reported. Compared with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and dexamethasone, cyclosporin probably makes little or no difference to complete, partial, or complete or partial remission (moderate-certainty evidence), and may make little or no difference to kidney failure, serious infection requiring hospitalisation or hypertension (low-certainty evidence). Among children who have achieved complete remission, tacrolimus compared with MMF may increase the number who maintain complete, partial, or complete or partial response for 12 months, but may make little or no difference to serious adverse events and serious infection (low-certainty evidence). Oral cyclophosphamide plus prednisone compared with prednisone alone may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete remission (low-certainty evidence) and has uncertain effects on adverse events. Kidney failure was not reported. Compared with oral cyclophosphamide plus intravenous dexamethasone, intravenous cyclophosphamide may make little or no difference to complete, partial, or complete or partial remission at six months. There may be little or no difference in bacterial infections; however, hypertension may decrease (all low-certainty evidence). Kidney failure was not reported. It is uncertain whether rituximab/cyclosporin/prednisolone compared with cyclosporin/prednisolone increases the likelihood of remission or reduces adverse events because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Kidney failure was not reported. Calcineurin inhibitors may increase the likelihood of complete or partial remission compared with placebo/no treatment or cyclophosphamide. For other regimens, it remains unclear whether the interventions alter outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is low. Further adequately powered, well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate other regimens for children with idiopathic SRNS. Since SRNS represents a spectrum of diseases, future studies should enrol children from better-defined groups of people with SRNS.",

  "abstract": "Background This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with amblyopia among preschool and school-going children aged 3-12 years. Methodology A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on 1,683 preschool and school-going children in western India. They were divided into three groups (group A: 3-5 years, group B: 6-9 years, and group C: 10-12 years). All participants underwent comprehensive ophthalmological evaluations to identify ocular causes of amblyopia such as refractive errors, strabismus, and stimulus deprivation. Non-ocular risk factors were assessed through detailed parental questionnaires addressing prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal histories. Results Of the children screened, 5.88% (n = 99) were diagnosed with refractive errors, and 1.66% (n = 28) were diagnosed with amblyopia. Among amblyopic children, refractive amblyopia was the most prevalent at 71.43% (n = 20, p < 0.0001), followed by strabismic amblyopia (21.43%, n = 6) and stimulus deprivation amblyopia (7.14%, n = 2). Astigmatism was found to be most amblyogenic in cases of both unilateral and bilateral amblyopia, though hypermetropic amblyopic children formed the majority of the refractive amblyopia population. The majority of children had moderately severe amblyopia across all age groups. Significant non-ocular risk factors included pre-obese maternal body mass index at conception (p < 0.001) and low birth weight (p < 0.001). Although preterm birth also emerged as a major risk factor, the results were not significant (p = 0.063). Conclusions Amblyopia in children can be attributed to both modifiable ocular and non-ocular risk factors. It is one of the most common reversible causes of childhood blindness. Early identification and intervention are essential for optimal visual outcomes, highlighting the importance of initiating amblyopia screening programs starting at preschool ages.",

  "abstract": "Universal access to influenza vaccination in pediatric age is crucial to reducing the burden of influenza among children. This study aimed to assess whether school-based influenza vaccination programs improve access and equity compared to health center-based campaigns, by comparing coverages by parental origin and economic status. We performed an observational, cross-sectional, population-based study in the Region of Murcia, Spain, using data from the regional registry of vaccinations (VACUSAN). Participants were 2018 and 2019-borns vaccinated with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) during the 2022-2023 health center-based vaccination campaign, and 2019 and 2020-borns vaccinated during the 2023-2024 school-based campaign as well as children born in 2021 before October 9, vaccinated during the 2023-2024 campaign at health centers. The outcome measure was vaccination coverage for each campaign and birth cohort by main parent's origin and economic section. During the 2022-2023 campaign 11,122 3 and 4-year-old children were vaccinated and 16,870 during the 2023-2024 school-based campaign; an additional 4605 2-year-old children were vaccinated at health centers in 2023-2024 campaign. Global coverage rose for 3 and 4-year-olds between campaigns for all main parent's origin and economic sections, with the biggest rise for the Western Mediterranean Origin. Similar results were observed for economic section F003 (foreign children without residence permit). During 2023-2024 campaign, 3 and 4-year-olds, vaccinated at school, achieved higher coverages than 2-year-olds, vaccinated at health centers, with the biggest differences for section 001 (lowest income). School vaccination campaigns achieve higher coverage than health center-based campaigns, particularly among children from disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, thereby promoting equity.",

This retrospective research included six homocystinuria patients. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients as age, gender, and comorbidities were collected. Relevant clinical and ophthalmic assessments, like visual acuity, fundus examination findings, complications, and type of surgery were also reported. Six patients with homocystinuria (12 eyes) were included.

All patients had ectopia lentis (100%), while one patient (16.7%) had eye ectropion, one patient (16.7%) had anterior uveitis, and one patient (16.7%) had scleromalacia. Surgery type was mostly lensectomy and vitrectomy (83.3%) then scleral fixation (16.7%), and Grice green procedure (16.7%). There were insignificant differences between first and last Autoref readings in spherical, cylinder, and axis errors of right and left eyes. Late-diagnosed homocystinuria patients frequently have abnormalities of the eyes. Ectopia lentis should always raise the possibility that homocystinuria is the cause of the condition.",

Twenty patients with diagnosed PD were recruited, and retinal imaging was successful on 17 patients (age 71.8 ± 7.2 years old, nine females). Retinal capillary perfusion density (CPD) was imaged using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and retinal blood flow (RBF) was imaged using a retinal function imager (RFI). All patients participated in three 1-hour YogaCue or Hatha yoga classes per week for 24 consecutive weeks. Pearson correlation analyses determined the relationship between the changes in retinal microcirculatory responses and cognitive function. Increased RBF was significantly related to the changes of CPD in all retinal slabs, including superficial and deeper vascular plexuses and retinal vascular network (6 mm scan, r ranged 0.58-0.83, P < 0.05). The increased RBF and CPD of superficial vascular plexus (6 mm scan) were related to the improvements (i.e., shorter time) in trail-making A performance (r = -0.66, P < 0.01 and r = -0.58, P < 0.05, respectively). In addition, the change of CPD in the retinal vascular network was related to improvement in Hopkins verbal delayed recall (r = 0.50, P < 0.05). This is the first study exploring the relationship between retinal microcirculatory responses to yoga exercise and cognitive function in PD patients. The synergistic effect of CPD and RBF may be developed into ocular indicators for monitoring the effect of cognitive improvement from yoga exercise in patients with PD.",

Initially presenting with left eye proptosis and eyelid puffiness, the patient was diagnosed with orbital cellulitis secondary to sinusitis and treated with intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage. Although the infection resolved completely, six months later, the patient developed persistent upper eyelid swelling, ptosis, and mild proptosis. Imaging revealed significant thickening of the left orbital roof without active inflammation or lesions. Surgical exploration and histopathological analysis confirmed reactive hyperostosis of the orbital roof, likely due to periosteal elevation during abscess drainage. Unlike chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) or orbital exenteration, where prolonged inflammation drives bone remodeling, no evidence of significant inflammation was observed in this case. Instead, the disruption of normal periosteal regulation may have triggered localized neo-osteogenesis. This case highlights an unusual occurrence for post-infectious orbital hyperostosis and emphasizes the importance of considering periosteal changes as a potential cause of late complications following orbital surgery or infection.",

This study assessed whether changes in mitochondrial respiration and content in PBMCs from postmenopausal BC patients persist up to 1 year after treatment. Thirty-four early-stage BC patients were studied before, shortly after, and six- and twelve-months post-treatment along with 20 healthy controls. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using high-resolution respirometry of intact and permeabilized PBMCs. Mitochondrial content was estimated by quantifying mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear DNA via qPCR. The mitochondrial respiratory capacity of intact and permeabilized PBMCs from BC patients significantly increased after adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy (+ 33% and + 30% for the maximal capacity of the electron transport system, ETS), consistent with previous findings. Importantly, the respiratory capacity returned to pre-treatment levels six months after treatment completion in both intact and permeabilized cells (- 23% and - 26% for the ETS). Healthy controls exhibited similar mitochondrial respiration but had increased mitochondrial content (+ 20%) compared to BC patients before treatment. In summary, chemo- and radiotherapy transiently increased mitochondrial respiration in PBMCs, returning to baseline within six months after treatment completion. This temporary rise in oxygen demand may reflect immune system activation.",

Among the metabolites that most significantly differed in concentration, tryptophan and retinol were significantly decreased in persons with TB disease (45.2 uM vs 62.5 uM and 4.1 uM vs 8.2 uM respectively), while kynurenine was significantly increased (2.1 uM vs 1.6 uM; q<0.0001 for all). A signature that included the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and retinol showed excellent classification for TB disease (AUC=0.97).

In Ethiopian participants, signature scores decreased after 2 (0.85 to 0.42) and 6 months of TB treatment (0.42 to 0.18; p<0.0001 for both) to similar levels as controls. Plasma retinol also declined in NHPs infected with Mtb 15-16 weeks after infection (5.9 uM vs 3.6 uM; p<0.001).

The epidemiological, auxological, laboratory data, genetic analysis results and treatment regimens of 44 patients diagnosed with MODY were retrospectively evaluated. Of the cases included, 27 (61.4%) were male and the mean age at diagnosis was 10.07 (1-16.8) years. There was a family history of diabetes in 42 (95.5%) cases. The distribution of gene variants was: 25 (55.8%) GCK, 4 (9.1%) HNF1A, 4 (9.1%) CEL, 2 (4.5%) BLK, 4 (9.1%) ABCC8, 2 (4.5%) KLF11, 1 (2.3%) INS, 1 (2.3%) KCNJ11, 1 (2.3%) APPL1. At presentation, 23 (52.3%) of the cases had incidental hyperglycemia, 14 (31.8%) had polyuria and polydipsia. Diabetic ketoacidosis was detected in 4 (9.1%) and ketonemia in 3 (6.8%). At least one of the diabetes autoantibodies (anti-GAD, anti-ICA, anti-IAA) was detected in 11 (25%) cases, of which 7 were islet antibodies, and 5 cases (11%) had two autoantibodies positive at the same time. In terms of treatment, 26 (59%) received diet and lifestyle changes only, 18 (41%) received oral antidiabetic agents and/or insulin, and 6 (13.6%) of them received both oral antidiabetic agents and insulin. The most common type of MODY in our study was GCK-MODY. Although MODY is generally known as an autoantibody-negative type of diabetes, autoantibody positivity was detected in 11 of 44 cases (25%) in our study.",

This study aimed to elucidate the positivity rates of four autoantibodies [anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 (anti-LKM1), and anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)] in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) before and after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy compared to those in healthy controls. This study enrolled prospectively collected plasma samples from 201 CHC patients [median age, 62 years; 49.8% women; 100% sustained virological response (SVR)] from eight hospitals before and after DAA therapy and 127 healthy individuals. Autoantibodies were detected using indirect immunofluorescence. The positivity rate of ANA was higher in CHC patients than in healthy controls (32.3%   21.3%, P=0.03) at pretreatment (PreTx) and decreased at SVR (32.3%   23.9%, P=0.009). Female sex and higher globulin levels were related to ANA positivity in the control and CHC patient groups. Thirty-seven (57%) of 65 patients with ANA-positive HCV at PreTx maintained ANA-positivity at SVR. Among the 136 ANA-negative patients at PreTx, 11 (8%) showed newly positive ANA conversion at SVR. Patients with ANA positivity at SVR (n=48) were older and had a higher proportion of advanced liver disease than ANA-negative patients (n=153). ANA positivity was observed in one-third of CHC patients at PreTx, which was significantly higher than that in healthy controls and decreased after SVR. CHC patients with ANA positivity after SVR were older and had more advanced liver disease than those with ANA negativity, suggesting persistent immune dysregulation after cure.",

  "abstract": "The benefits and harms of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for lung cancer vary across groups, including those typically underrepresented in randomized clinical trials. To quantify the harms and benefits of ICI-containing regimens in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer and assess heterogeneity across priority subgroups. This retrospective cohort study conducted in 2024 used 2013 to 2019 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare data of individuals 66 years or older with non-small cell lung cancer who were exposed to any ICI. ICI + chemotherapy, single ICI (reference group). Severe immune-related adverse events (irAE; harm) and mortality (when delayed mortality was the benefit). Severe irAEs were defined using validated diagnosis and medication codes. Mortality was ascertained from Medicare data. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated and 95% CIs were stratified by whether an ICI was used as the first or second or later systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) and in subgroups defined by preexisting autoimmune disease, sex, and age. The harm-benefit tradeoff was described as excess severe irAEs per year of life gained in which the gain in survival time was assessed using restricted mean survival time. Of 17 681 Medicare beneficiaries, 8797 (49.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 74 (6.0) years. Compared with a single ICI (14 249 [80.6%]), individuals treated with ICI + chemotherapy (3432 [19.4%]) had an elevated risk of severe irAE in the first SACT setting (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30) but not in the second or later SACT setting (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.92-1.19); there was a decreased risk of mortality in the first SACT setting (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.62-0.72) but not in the second or later SACT setting (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.68-1.03). In the first SACT setting, ICI + chemotherapy delayed mortality more among patients with (vs without) autoimmune disease at baseline. For each 1 year of life gained, the risk of severe irAEs was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.09-0.53) and the tradeoff was also statistically significant in men and patients without autoimmune disease. The results of this cohort study suggest that given both treatment-related harms and benefits, ICI + chemotherapy use in the first SACT setting requires informed decision-making; the potential benefits of ICI + chemotherapy vs single ICI in high-risk subgroups is encouraging.",

Although advancements in diabetes technology, especially hybrid closed-loop (HCL) and advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) systems, have greatly enhanced management for nonpregnant individuals with T1D, pregnant patients still represent a high-risk group that requires further research. Existing trials have shown mixed data in terms of clinically meaningful benefits in glycemic control, but these may be specific to the closed-loop system. Currently, there is one AHCL system approved and available for use in pregnancies complicated by diabetes in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. However, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved closed-loop systems for use during pregnancy in the United States. Existing HCL/AHCL system use is off-label for pregnancy in the United States and often requires assistive techniques to target the tighter glucose levels needed during pregnancy. For patients struggling on multiple daily injections (MDIs) or sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT), studies have shown that HCL/AHCLs can reduce the burden of care and enable some people to achieve tighter glucose levels. This review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence of closed-loop systems in pregnancies complicated by T1D and to discuss their implications and considerations with system use.",

  "abstract": "PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been used to treat gastric cancer, and PD-L1 expression has been identified as a biomarker for predicting the effectiveness of immunotherapy in the treatment of gastric cancer. However, PD-L1 expression prediction for immunotherapy response is inaccurate, and improved response biomarkers are required. Thus, it is important to identify additional biomarkers that can predict the responses to PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in gastric cancer. In this study, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of 142 DEGs co-expressed with PD-L1 were performed, and 41 genes were identified based on the intersection of the mRNA-significant GO term network and the mRNA-significant signalling pathway network. Further intersection analysis of the 41 candidate genes and 137 positive immunotherapy response genes indicated that BATF2 significantly affects the overall survival of GC patients. The transcription factor prediction for BATF2 identified additional potential predictors and therapeutic targets for GC. STAT and IRF family members were predicted to be transcription factors for BATF2. In addition, BATF2 knockdown significantly promoted GC cell growth, and PD-L1 expression was upregulated in si-BATF2-treated MKN-45 cells. Thus, BATF2 may serve as a biomarker for predicting the efficacy of PD-L1 blockade therapy in GC. BATF2 acts as a tumour suppressor gene during the development of GC. BATF2 is closely related to PD-L1 expression in GC, and high BATF2 expression positively correlates with low PD-L1 expression. BATF2 can be used as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for responding to anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies in GC.",

  "abstract": "Under insulin-resistant conditions, such as obesity, pancreatic β cells adaptively proliferate and secrete more insulin to prevent blood glucose elevation. We previously reported hepatic ERK activation during obesity development to stimulate a neuronal relay system, consisting of afferent splanchnic nerves from the liver and efferent vagal nerves to the pancreas, thereby triggering adaptive β cell proliferation. However, the mechanism linking obesity with the interorgan system originating in hepatic ERK activation remains unclear. Herein, we clarified that colonic inflammation promotes β cell proliferation through this interorgan system from the liver to the pancreas. First, dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment induced colonic inflammation and hepatic ERK activation as well as β cell proliferation, all of which were suppressed by blockades of the neuronal relay system by several approaches. In addition, treatment with anti-lymphocyte Peyer's patch adhesion molecule-1 (anti-LPAM1) antibody suppressed β cell proliferation induced by DSS treatment. Importantly, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding also elicited colonic inflammation, and its inhibition by anti-LPAM1 antibody administration suppressed hepatic ERK activation and β cell proliferation induced by HFD. Thus, colonic inflammation triggers adaptive β cell proliferation via the interorgan mechanism originating in hepatic ERK activation. The present study revealed a potentially novel role of the gastrointestinal tract in the maintenance of β cell regulation.",

  "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA). The pathogenic and protective roles of ACPA of distinct specificities are emerging and remains poorly understood. Thus, it is crucial to define the range of ACPA specificities and determine their contribution to disease and their potential clinical relevance. Since extracellular citrullination occurs in RA, we investigated whether autoantibodies in RA patients bind a citrullinated form of the cell-surface receptor CLEC12A that is expressed on neutrophils, the most abundant leukocyte in inflamed joints. We generated a FLAG-tagged, recombinant form of the extracellular portion of human CLEC12A. After purification, the tag was removed prior to citrullination by PAD2 that was confirmed by mass spectrometry. We developed an ELISA for citrullinated CLEC12A to screen for seropositivity in sera of 68 RA patients and 36 healthy controls. Potential associations between these autoantibodies and clinical variables were determined. In our cohort, 40 % of RA patients were positive for anti-citrullinated CLEC12A autoantibodies. Those seropositive patients were younger than RA patients that tested negative for these autoantibodies (p = 0.0058). Most patients had antibodies to multiple citrullinated and homocitrullinated antigens; 17 % of patients negative for other ACPA were positive for anti-citrullinated CLEC12A autoantibodies. This is the first report of seropositivity towards citrullinated CLEC12A in RA patients. A validation cohort will confirm our findings and identify additional correlations between these autoantibodies and clinical parameters. Citrullination may be a mechanism through which CLEC12A's inhibitory function is altered to exacerbate inflammation in RA. Identifying citrullinated neoantigens advances our understanding of the diverse molecular mechanisms that contribute to RA pathogenesis.",

This study aimed to analyse predictive factors for occurrence of ICAc/o in AiHy. Retrospective analysis of three own cases and 16 published cases. Among 15 surgically treated patients with AiHy, we identified three cases with ICAc/o via time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA). In addition, 16 published cases with AiHy and ICAc/o were identified via a literature search. Clinical features, treatment, and outcomes were evaluated. TOF MRA revealed a complete bilateral ICA occlusion (ICAo) in Case 1 and an incomplete bilateral ICA constriction (ICAc) in Case 2. In the third case, left-sided ICAo was confirmed by CTA. None of our three patients with AiHy complicated by ICAc/o suffered brain infarction or neurological deficits. All three cases exhibited a parasellar T2 dark sign and a strong dural enhancement. With three own cases included, seven of 19 published cases (36.8%) showed complete bilateral ICAo. Among these, four presented with ischaemic stroke. Eight of 19 patients (42.1%) presented with cranial nerve palsy. While all patients presented with hypopituitarism, only five had arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency. Interestingly, 11 patients had a recurrent course of hypophysitis. ICAc/o caused by AiHy appears to be more frequent than previously reported. Special attention should be paid to the carotid arteries in AiHy because of the potentially deleterious complication of ICAc/o. Cranial nerve palsy, a parasellar T2 dark sign, strong perisellar dural enhancement, and a recurrent course of hypophysitis can be considered warning signs of the occurrence of ICAc/o.",

This study aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics of DVT among patients of different ages.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 938 patients with symptomatic lower extremity DVT admitted to our hospital between January 2020 and January 2024. Patients were categorized into youth (<40 years), middle-aged (40-64 years), and elderly (>65 years) groups. Demographic data, comorbidities, risk factors, clinical presentations, and management approaches were collected and analyzed.ResultsMost participants were middle-aged or elderly, with young patients constituting only 11.19% of the study population. The youth group had a slight female predominance, while the middle-aged and elderly group had a balanced gender distribution. The elderly group were more likely to have comorbidities such as diabetes and malignancies, though they had a lower prevalence of autoimmune diseases compared to younger patients. Congenital risk factors were relatively rare in the overall population, yet were present in 22.86% of young patients, a significantly higher proportion than in the middle-aged and elderly groups. Most patients with DVT were provoked, especially in the elderly group. The prevalence of concurrent congenital and acquired factors was 13.33% in the youth group, compared to only 4.97% in the middle-aged group and 2.88% in the elderly group. Proximal DVT was most frequent in middle-aged patients, while young patients were more likely to seek treatment in the acute phase and undergo surgical intervention. Anticoagulation noncompliance was noted in nearly 40% of elderly patients but only 6.67% of young patients.ConclusionRisk factors and clinical characteristics of DVT vary significantly with age, particularly between young and elderly patients.

  "abstract": "Background Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder. While eating disorders have been associated with other autoimmune diseases, no studies have explored this relationship in patients with HT to date. This study aimed to evaluate eating behaviors in euthyroid patients with HT. Materials and methods This case-control, cross-sectional study included a total of 107 patients diagnosed with HT, aged 18-45 years, as well as 54 healthy volunteers. Thyroid function tests, anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and anti-antithyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies were measured in all participants. The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were used to assess eating disorders and physical activity levels. Results Compared to the healthy control group, patients with HT, especially those receiving levothyroxine (LT4), had significantly higher scores on the TFEQ and NEQ. A positive correlation was detected between TFEQ and NEQ scores and anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels, LT4 treatment duration, and LT4 dose. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the IPAQ scores. A negative correlation was found between TFEQ scores and serum triiodothyronine (sT3). In patients with HT, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were within the higher-normal range, while sT3 levels were lower-normal compared to controls. Conclusion There is a spectrum of eating disorders among patients with HT. The underlying cause of these disorders remains unclear and may be associated with thyroid antibodies and/or hormonal status. In LT4 replacement therapy, efforts should be made to mimic true physiology as closely as possible. In the follow-up of patients with HT, while TSH is within lower-normal limits, sT3 levels may be observed to be in a higher-normal range. In selected cases, a combination of T4/T3 therapy or T3 extract may be recommended. Close monitoring of patients with HT is essential, particularly for potential eating disorder-related complications, such as obesity.",

  "abstract": "The global elderly population is rapidly increasing, with projections estimating that the number of older adults will reach 2.1 billion. Elder abuse, a significant public health issue, leads to serious psychological, physical, and social consequences. Therefore, this study aims to assess the prevalence of elder abuse in Qazvin, Iran, while exploring correlated factors that may act as potential risks or protective factors, especially within the context of post-pandemic COVID-19 conditions. This cross-sectional study, conducted from May to October 2024, included 540 older adults aged 60 and above residing in Qazvin city, Iran. Participants were selected using a multi-stage cluster sampling method. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a demographic checklist, the General Health Questionnaire, the Advanced Activities of Daily Living Scale, the Mini-Cog Screening Tool, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Short Version of the Domestic Elder Abuse Assessment Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using one-sided and two- sided chi-square tests, as well as a logistic regression model. A total of 540 older adults participated in the study, with a mean age of 72.08 ± 8.08 years. The majority of the participants were married (n = 390, 72.2%) and had an average economic status (n = 348,64.4%). Among the participants, 71.1% (n = 384) reported experiencing at least one form of elder abuse within the past year, with psychological abuse (n = 274, 50.7%) and care neglect (n = 269,49.8%) being the most prevalent forms. The results indicated that elder abuse was significantly associated with good and excellent economic status (OR = 0.335, 95% CI: 0.150-0.749), being homemaker (OR = 2.789, 95% CI: 1.252-6.215), and having better mental health (OR = 0.931,95% CI: 0.885-0.980). This study found a high prevalence of elder abuse in Qazvin city, with economic status, employment status, and mental health identified as key predictors. Based on these findings, further in-depth investigations are needed to explore the underlying causes of elder abuse. Additionally, efforts to clarify statistics and raise community awareness about the dimensions and reporting mechanisms of elder abuse are essential. The development of integrated support services to promote the physical and mental health of older adults and reduce their dependency is strongly recommended.",

  "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most frequently prescribed medicines, commonly used to mitigate pain, inflammation, and cardiovascular prevention, among others. Chronic NSAID consumption increases the risk of acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and gastrointestinal toxicity, ranging from mild dyspepsia to serious ulcer complications such as bleeding, obstruction, and perforation. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may exert a gastroprotective effect from NSAID gastroduodenal injury by reducing gastric acid secretion. To assess the effects of proton pump inhibitors on the prevention of dyspepsia and ulcers in people with chronic consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and two trial registers up to 23 October 2023, as well as reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs comparing PPIs taken orally versus placebo, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, misoprostol, or sucralfate in adults and children with chronic consumption of NSAIDs for four weeks or longer. Our outcomes were global symptoms of dyspepsia, incident ulcer, adverse events, ulcer complications, and quality of life. We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs and the tool extension for cluster-RCTs. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Due to statistical heterogeneity, we conducted meta-analyses for all but two outcomes. We summarised the certainty of evidence according to GRADE methods. We included 12 studies with 8760 participants. All studies were conducted in an outpatient setting in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Central America, South America, and Australia. They were published between 1996 and 2014. All studies measured outcomes in the short term (up to 12 months). PPI versus placebo PPIs may have little to no effect on global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a dichotomous outcome, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.36 to 1.13; 8 studies; 4944 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia assessed as a continuous outcome (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.38; 2 studies, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a reduction in incident ulcers compared to placebo (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.36; 11 studies, 7022 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPIs may have few or no adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain (meta-analysis was not possible due to high and unexplained statistical heterogeneity and point estimates of RR ranged from 0.67 to 6.35; 12 studies, 7530 participants; very low-certainty evidence). PPIs may reduce ulcer complications compared with placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.07; P = 0.30; I  = 18%; 5 studies, 4394 participants; low-certainty evidence). PPIs probably result in a slight increase in quality of life (MD 0.39, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.55; 2 studies, 1149 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). PPI versus histamine 2-receptor antagonists PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 19.44; 1 study, 26 participants; low-certainty evidence). The included study did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, adverse events, ulcer complications, or quality of life. PPI versus misoprostol PPIs may increase incident ulcers (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.25 to 4.30; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may have fewer adverse events (RR 0.38, 0.25 to 0.57; 1 study, 402 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. The included study did not report data on global symptoms of dyspepsia, ulcer complications, or quality of life. No studies compared PPI against sucralfate. Most included studies were at overall high risk of bias or overall some concerns of risk of bias. Imprecision in the effect estimates was also a concern. Compared with placebo, PPIs may have no effect on the presence of global symptoms of dyspepsia and probably result in a slight reduction in global symptoms of dyspepsia scales. PPI probably reduces incident ulcers and may have little to no effect on adverse events. PPIs may reduce ulcer complications and probably slightly increase quality of life. Compared with histamine 2-receptor antagonists, PPIs may increase incident ulcers. The evidence for this comparison came from only one study. Compared with misoprostol, PPIs may increase incident ulcers and may reduce adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence for this comparison came from only one study. The certainty of the evidence for most outcomes and comparisons was low or very low, except for global symptoms of dyspepsia measured as a continuous outcome, incident ulcer, and quality of life in the comparison of PPI versus placebo. Further research is needed to assess the effect of PPIs compared to other active treatments such as sucralfate, misoprostol, or histamine 2-receptor antagonists. Well-designed and reported studies focussing on patient-important outcomes and addressing the methodological limitations found in the present included studies would be informative. These could include different baseline ulcer risks, ages, and types of NSAIDs. Long-term follow-up would be beneficial. This Cochrane review had no dedicated funding.

  "abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine glands. It can lead to various clinical manifestations. The primary objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and management strategies used in managing APS, based on a review of case reports. We emphasize disease pattern recognition and detection of atypical clinical signs, as well as the outcomes of various treatment modalities. Case reports from credible journals were searched in PubMed, resulting in a systematic literature review adopting the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. Of the 1173 records identified, 474 remained after duplicates were removed, and 49 full-text articles were reviewed. After further screening based on criteria such as associated disorders, patient age, follow-up, and treatment details, 12 articles were selected for the final analysis. The findings revealed that common endocrine dysfunctions in APS include Addison's disease and hypothyroidism, while non-endocrine manifestations, such as autoimmune encephalitis and pernicious anemia, can also occur. The most frequently adopted strategies were immunosuppressive and hormone therapies. The heterogeneity of APS indicates early diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies. Ultimately, this analysis identifies existing insufficiencies and provides recommendations for formulating standard operating procedures for the treatment of APS.",

  "abstract": "The persistence of HIV-1 in a latent state within long-lived immune cells remains a major barrier to a cure for HIV-1 infection. The \"block-and-lock\" strategy aims to silence the HIV-1 provirus permanently using latency promoting agents (LPAs). LEDGINs, a well-known class of LPAs, inhibit the interaction between viral integrase and LEDGF/p75, reducing viral integration and retargeting the provirus to regions resistant to reactivation. However, proximity to enhancers may still permit residual transcription. Given BRD4's central role in the enhancer biology, we now test two BRD4 modulators, JQ1 and ZL0580. Mechanistic studies reveal that JQ1 and ZL0580 have contrasting effects on Tat-dependent HIV-1 transcription, resulting in JQ1 promoting viral reactivation and ZL0580 inducing transcriptional silencing. Combining ZL0580 with LEDGINs has an additive effect in blocking HIV-1 transcription and reactivation, in both cell lines and primary cells. These findings demonstrate the potential of ZL0580 to enhance the block-and-lock cure strategy.",

This study investigates their effects on hepatocyte apoptosis and liver architecture in a doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity model, utilizing techniques such as TUNEL assay, immunohistochemistry (Bax & Bcl2), H&E staining, and scanning electron microscopy. Thirty female Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n=6): Group I (Normal healthy control), Group II (Doxorubicin-intoxicated control), Group III (Doxorubicin-intoxicated + methyl gallate), Group IV (Doxorubicin-intoxicated + chia seed oil), and Group V (Doxorubicin-intoxicated + both). Liver function tests, histology, and cell apoptosis analysis were performed to assess the effects. Doxorubicin-intoxicated rats (Group II) exhibited significantly elevated ALT, AST, and ALP levels (p < 0.001) and severe hepatic damage compared to controls. Group III and Group IV showed significant reductions in liver enzyme levels (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), while Group V demonstrated the most significant decrease (p < 0.001). Immunohistochemistry revealed increased Bax and decreased Bcl2 expression in Group II (p < 0.001), which improved significantly with methyl gallate, chia seed oil, and their combination (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). TUNEL assay showed reduced apoptotic index in treatment groups, with Group V showing the most significant reduction (p < 0.001). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis confirmed restoration of hepatocyte architecture, especially in Group V. Methyl gallate and chia seed oil, individually and in combination, demonstrated significant hepatoprotective effects against doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity, with the combination showing the greatest efficacy. These nutraceuticals hold promise as adjunct therapies to reduce doxorubicin-induced liver injury.",

  "abstract": "Adult-onset nesidioblastosis is an exceedingly rare yet significant cause of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This condition is often associated to bariatric surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Characterized by abnormal β-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, its diagnosis presents a unique challenge due to overlapping features with insulinomas and post-bariatric hypoglycemia syndrome (PBHS). We report a 55-year-old woman with a history of gastric sleeve and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeries who presented with a 1.5-year history of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. Her symptoms, including blurred vision, tremors, and altered consciousness, persisted despite medical therapy with octreotide, acarbose, and nifedipine. Extensive imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, ruled out insulinomas, raising suspicion of non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome. The patient underwent laparoscopic subtotal distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation. Histopathological examination confirmed nesidioblastosis, revealing irregular islet distribution and β-cell hypertrophy. Post-surgery, the patient achieved normoglycemia without recurrence of hypoglycemic episodes during follow-up. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing nesidioblastosis in adults, especially following bariatric surgeries. Nesidioblastosis involves β-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy driven by hormonal factors like GLP-1, whereas PBHS results from altered incretin patterns causing excessive insulin release. Advanced imaging and multidisciplinary collaboration are important for accurate diagnosis. Surgical management remains a cornerstone for refractory cases, as demonstrated in this patient's remarkable recovery. Nesidioblastosis is a rare condition but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing nesidioblastosis from PBHS to ensure appropriate and effective management strategies.",

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae.

This meta-analysis adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024562550). PubMed, Cochrane, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect databases were searched for studies published before July 2024 using predefined Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords related to ACL-R infections and arthroscopic irrigation and debridement. Inclusion criteria followed the PICO framework: Population (patients with septic arthritis following ACL-R), intervention (arthroscopic irrigation and debridement), comparator (none), and outcomes (graft retention rate, Lysholm Knee Score, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKD] score, and Tegner Activity Scale [TAS], and microbiology data). The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions. Meta-analyses were performed using R Studio, with results presented as pooled proportions or means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A total of 20 studies involving 333 patients were analyzed, with follow-up periods ranging from 18 days to 67 months. The pooled graft retention rate was 92% (95% CI [88-94%]), confirmed by proportional meta-analysis with low heterogeneity (I\"=0%, P=2.0948). Functional knee outcomes showed pooled mean scores of 82.41 for Lysholm (95% CI [78.15-86.66], I\"=87.3%-92.7%), 79.37 for IKDC (95% CI [74.00-84.75], I\"=68.3%-82.2%), and 5.08 for TAS (95% CI [4.87-5.30], I\"=0%-52.6%), indicating moderate to satisfactory recovery. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (42.34%) and Staphylococcus aureus (23.12%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, with 9.91% of cases involving antibiotic-resistant strains, including MRSA (4.50%) and MR-CNS (5.41%). Cephalosporin or vancomycin was the most commonly administered first-line antibiotic, often combined with other agents. The findings suggest that arthroscopic irrigation and debridement, combined with appropriate antibiotic therapy, are e!ective in managing septic arthritis following ACL-R, achieving a high graft retention rate of 92% and moderate to satisfactory functional outcomes. However, the presence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and challenges in returning to high-level sports highlight the importance of preventive measures to protect athlete performance and recovery.

PGM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to complex wound shapes and depths, ensuring stable tissue adhesion even in dynamic and moist microenvironment, the optimal adhesive strengths of PGM adhering to porcine skin is 10.3 kPa. Particularly, its multifunctional performance integrates cell migration, hemostatic activity, and reactive oxygen species scavenging. In addition, skin wound healing in a full-thickness skin defect model was achieved by down regulating TNF-a expression while promoting collagen regeneration and CD31 expression. Altogether, a new strategy of injectable microgel is developed for drug-free, efficient full-thickness wound healing, offering significant potential for clinical applications.",

We hypothesized that metabolite quantification across the pulmonary vascular bed in connective tissue disease-associated (CTD-associated) PAH would identify transpulmonary gradients of pathobiologically relevant metabolites, in an exercise stage-specific manner. Sixty-three CTD patients with established or suspected PAH underwent exercise right heart catheterization. Using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, metabolites were quantified in plasma samples simultaneously collected from the pulmonary and radial arteries at baseline and during resistance-free wheeling, peak exercise, and recovery. We identified uptake and excretion of metabolites across the pulmonary vascular bed, unique and distinct from single vascular site analysis. We demonstrated the physiological relevance of metabolites previously shown to promote disease in animal models and end-stage human lung tissues, including acylcarnitines, glycolytic intermediates, and tryptophan catabolites. Notably, pulmonary vascular metabolite handling was exercise stage specific. Transpulmonary metabolite gradients correlated with hemodynamic endpoints largely during free-wheeling. Glycolytic intermediates demonstrated physiologic significance at peak exercise, including net uptake of lactate in those with more advanced disease. Contribution of pulmonary vascular metabolism to CTD-PAH pathogenesis and therapeutic candidacy of metabolism modulation must be considered in the context of physiologic stress.",

  "abstract": "Discontinuing effective school health interventions prevents new practices from reaching wider student populations and wastes investment in implementation. While reviews have consistently identified facilitators and barriers to the sustainment of school health interventions, the social processes underlying sustainment remain unclear. We explored the post-trial sustainment of \"Learning Together,\" a whole-school intervention, found to be effective in preventing bullying and promoting wellbeing in English secondary schools. We examined how staff and students described its sustainment in the 2 years post-trial, what factors staff referred to in explaining their motivation to sustain it, and how schools' capacities affected sustainment. Learning Together involved training staff in restorative practice (RP) and supporting schools to implement a staff-student action group and a social and emotional learning curriculum. Using a case-study design, we collected qualitative data from five schools: staff and student interviews 1-year post-trial; staff interviews 2 years post-trial; and descriptive data from the original trial's process evaluation. The General Theory of Implementation guided our thematic analysis. No school sustained the intervention in its entirety. RP was continued by some individuals in all schools and was sustained at school-level in one school. The curriculum and action groups were discontinued in all schools, although actions initiated by the groups were sustained in two schools. Staff motivation to sustain components was affected by their perceived effectiveness, and individual motivations to sustain RP differed from whole-school commitment to sustaining the approach. Schools' capacities to sustain Learning Together were affected by: the prioritization of academic learning time; the frequent implementation of new initiatives; the timeliness of interventions with school improvements plans; and leadership engagement. Schools needed support to disseminate RP knowledge and skills school-wide and ensure consistent practice, and turnover adversely impacted on knowledge transfer. Sustainment was an intentional, labor-intensive, social process. Intervention developers should consider whether/how interventions are designed to work alongside, replace, or can refine existing practices, and should support schools to mainstream evidence-based interventions to sustain them at school-level.",

  "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) has previously been shown to increase after chemo- and radiotherapy in early-stage breast cancer (BC) patients, but the persistence of the increase remains unknown. This study assessed whether changes in mitochondrial respiration and content in PBMCs from postmenopausal BC patients persist up to 1 year after treatment. Thirty-four early-stage BC patients were studied before, shortly after, and six- and twelve-months post-treatment along with 20 healthy controls. Mitochondrial respiration was measured using high-resolution respirometry of intact and permeabilized PBMCs. Mitochondrial content was estimated by quantifying mitochondrial DNA relative to nuclear DNA via qPCR. The mitochondrial respiratory capacity of intact and permeabilized PBMCs from BC patients significantly increased after adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy (+ 33% and + 30% for the maximal capacity of the electron transport system, ETS), consistent with previous findings. Importantly, the respiratory capacity returned to pre-treatment levels six months after treatment completion in both intact and permeabilized cells (- 23% and - 26% for the ETS). Healthy controls exhibited similar mitochondrial respiration but had increased mitochondrial content (+ 20%) compared to BC patients before treatment. In summary, chemo- and radiotherapy transiently increased mitochondrial respiration in PBMCs, returning to baseline within six months after treatment completion. This temporary rise in oxygen demand may reflect immune system activation.",

  "abstract": "Pregnancy in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is well-known to be linked to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Although advancements in diabetes technology, especially hybrid closed-loop (HCL) and advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) systems, have greatly enhanced management for nonpregnant individuals with T1D, pregnant patients still represent a high-risk group that requires further research. Existing trials have shown mixed data in terms of clinically meaningful benefits in glycemic control, but these may be specific to the closed-loop system. Currently, there is one AHCL system approved and available for use in pregnancies complicated by diabetes in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. However, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved closed-loop systems for use during pregnancy in the United States. Existing HCL/AHCL system use is off-label for pregnancy in the United States and often requires assistive techniques to target the tighter glucose levels needed during pregnancy. For patients struggling on multiple daily injections (MDIs) or sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT), studies have shown that HCL/AHCLs can reduce the burden of care and enable some people to achieve tighter glucose levels. This review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence of closed-loop systems in pregnancies complicated by T1D and to discuss their implications and considerations with system use.",

  "abstract": "Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN) is a rare form of immune complex-mediated primary glomerular disease frequently coexisting with malignancies or autoimmune diseases. The kidney prognosis is extremely poor, with approximately 50% of patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease within 2-4 years after diagnosis. However, no established treatment currently exists. Here we describe a rare case of FGN diagnosed in a patient progressing from monoclonal gammopathy to multiple myeloma. The histopathological findings of the kidney biopsy were consistent with classical FGN and revealed no evidence of myeloma cast nephropathy. Albumin-dominant, Bence Jones protein-negative proteinuria further supported this diagnosis. The patient was successfully treated with anti-myeloma chemotherapies including autologous stem cell transplant, resulting in significant improvement in kidney function. Based on our experience, secondary FGN associated with plasma cell neoplasms may represent a rare entity that responds favorably to anti-myeloma therapies. Initial investigations to rule out coexistent plasma cell neoplasms are crucial for the optimal management of FGN patients.",

  "abstract": "Background Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is an organ-specific autoimmune disorder. While eating disorders have been associated with other autoimmune diseases, no studies have explored this relationship in patients with HT to date. This study aimed to evaluate eating behaviors in euthyroid patients with HT. Materials and methods This case-control, cross-sectional study included a total of 107 patients diagnosed with HT, aged 18-45 years, as well as 54 healthy volunteers. Thyroid function tests, anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and anti-antithyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies were measured in all participants. The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) were used to assess eating disorders and physical activity levels. Results Compared to the healthy control group, patients with HT, especially those receiving levothyroxine (LT4), had significantly higher scores on the TFEQ and NEQ. A positive correlation was detected between TFEQ and NEQ scores and anti-TPO and anti-Tg levels, LT4 treatment duration, and LT4 dose. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of the IPAQ scores. A negative correlation was found between TFEQ scores and serum triiodothyronine (sT3). In patients with HT, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were within the higher-normal range, while sT3 levels were lower-normal compared to controls. Conclusion There is a spectrum of eating disorders among patients with HT. The underlying cause of these disorders remains unclear and may be associated with thyroid antibodies and/or hormonal status. In LT4 replacement therapy, efforts should be made to mimic true physiology as closely as possible. In the follow-up of patients with HT, while TSH is within lower-normal limits, sT3 levels may be observed to be in a higher-normal range. In selected cases, a combination of T4/T3 therapy or T3 extract may be recommended. Close monitoring of patients with HT is essential, particularly for potential eating disorder-related complications, such as obesity.",

  "abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine glands. It can lead to various clinical manifestations. The primary objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and management strategies used in managing APS, based on a review of case reports. We emphasize disease pattern recognition and detection of atypical clinical signs, as well as the outcomes of various treatment modalities. Case reports from credible journals were searched in PubMed, resulting in a systematic literature review adopting the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. Of the 1173 records identified, 474 remained after duplicates were removed, and 49 full-text articles were reviewed. After further screening based on criteria such as associated disorders, patient age, follow-up, and treatment details, 12 articles were selected for the final analysis. The findings revealed that common endocrine dysfunctions in APS include Addison's disease and hypothyroidism, while non-endocrine manifestations, such as autoimmune encephalitis and pernicious anemia, can also occur. The most frequently adopted strategies were immunosuppressive and hormone therapies. The heterogeneity of APS indicates early diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies. Ultimately, this analysis identifies existing insufficiencies and provides recommendations for formulating standard operating procedures for the treatment of APS.",

  "abstract": "Adult-onset nesidioblastosis is an exceedingly rare yet significant cause of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This condition is often associated to bariatric surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Characterized by abnormal β-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, its diagnosis presents a unique challenge due to overlapping features with insulinomas and post-bariatric hypoglycemia syndrome (PBHS). We report a 55-year-old woman with a history of gastric sleeve and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeries who presented with a 1.5-year history of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. Her symptoms, including blurred vision, tremors, and altered consciousness, persisted despite medical therapy with octreotide, acarbose, and nifedipine. Extensive imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, ruled out insulinomas, raising suspicion of non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome. The patient underwent laparoscopic subtotal distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation. Histopathological examination confirmed nesidioblastosis, revealing irregular islet distribution and β-cell hypertrophy. Post-surgery, the patient achieved normoglycemia without recurrence of hypoglycemic episodes during follow-up. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing nesidioblastosis in adults, especially following bariatric surgeries. Nesidioblastosis involves β-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy driven by hormonal factors like GLP-1, whereas PBHS results from altered incretin patterns causing excessive insulin release. Advanced imaging and multidisciplinary collaboration are important for accurate diagnosis. Surgical management remains a cornerstone for refractory cases, as demonstrated in this patient's remarkable recovery. Nesidioblastosis is a rare condition but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing nesidioblastosis from PBHS to ensure appropriate and effective management strategies.",

Specific analyses of semaglutide safety data in older adults are limited; therefore, in the current analysis, we aimed to evaluate safety considerations with semaglutide in adults ≥ 65 years. Adverse event (AE) data from three semaglutide phase 3a programs in participants ≥ 65 years with type 2 diabetes and/or overweight/obesity were pooled. Change in body weight was also assessed in a smaller subset of participants ≥ 65 years. The analysis included 3529 participants ≥ 65 years. Baseline mean age and body mass index in participants ≥ 65 years were 69.3 to 70.2 years and 29.7 to 35.4 kg/m , respectively, compared to 47.8 to 58.5 years and 31.3 to 36.7 kg/m  in the overall population. AEs with semaglutide occurred in 73.6% to 92.4% of participants ≥ 65 years versus 73.2% to 90.8% of the overall population. AEs with semaglutide leading to permanent discontinuation appeared to be more frequent in participants ≥ 65 years (9.3%-12.4%) versus the overall population (5.7%-8.7%). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported AEs with semaglutide in participants ≥ 65 years (44.6%-73.8%) and in the overall population (39.1%-73.4%). Participants aged ≥ 65 years receiving semaglutide had an estimated weight loss of 3.8% at week 52 compared to 0.1% with placebo. Age ≥ 65 years did not appear to affect the safety considerations of semaglutide. The ongoing evoke/evoke+ trials will elucidate the balance of efficacy and safety in the treatment of early AD with semaglutide. This was a post hoc analysis evaluating adverse event (AE) data of semaglutide in people ≥ 65 years.The most common AE with semaglutide was gastrointestinal (GI).GI event rates were similar in people ≥ 65 years and the overall study populations.",

  "abstract": "Control of circulating phosphorus concentrations in patients with chronic kidney disease is a mainstay of treatment and may include use of aluminum hydroxide as an intestinal phosphate binder. Serious complications of excess aluminum reported in dogs and man include encephalopathy, microcytic anemia, osteomalacia, and regional myopathy at serum concentrations exceeding 100 ng/mL. Reports of aluminum toxicosis are not available for cats receiving aluminum hydroxide and circulating aluminum concentrations are poorly characterized. The aim of this study is to establish therapeutic and toxic serum aluminum concentrations in cats and apply this data to an intoxication case. Of cats with CKD who received aluminum hydroxide, 9/21 serum samples exceeded aluminum concentrations of 100 ng/mL. After removal of outliers, 18 cats with kidney disease who received aluminum hydroxide had mean serum aluminum concentrations of 69 ng/mL [95% CI: 42-97 ng/mL], which was significantly higher than mean aluminum concentrations in cats not receiving aluminum hydroxide (p = 0.0034). The mean aluminum concentration of 141 feline serum samples not receiving aluminum hydroxide was 29 ng/mL [95% CI: 24-33 ng/mL]. Of the 141 samples, 16 cats presenting for wellness or dental procedures had mean concentrations of 36 ng/mL [95% CI: 15-56 ng/mL]. This data was applied to a case of a 16-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair with IRIS stage 2 chronic kidney disease with a 7-month history of mild hindlimb weakness and intermittent right forelimb myoclonus. The patient received oral aluminum hydroxide, and the serum contained 376 ng/mL of aluminum suggestive of toxicosis. Resolution of clinical signs was noted following a switch to an aluminum-free phosphate binding medication, and, at 5-month follow-up, the serum aluminum concentration was 71 ng/mL. Our data suggest that serum aluminum concentrations in cats exceeding 86 ng/mL can result in clinical aluminum toxicosis and is comparable to the 100 ng/mL toxic threshold described in humans. The data provided facilitate the diagnostic assessment of cats receiving aluminum hydroxide supplementation. Veterinarians must recognize the toxic effects of aluminum and pursue diagnostic testing in suspect cases to mitigate invasive and costly workup for aluminum-associated clinical signs or euthanasia due to deterioration of these patients.",

This study aimed to investigate the complementary effects of combination therapy with pioglitazone (PIO) and empagliflozin (EMPA) on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In a randomized, open-label trial, 50 participants with type 2 diabetes and MASLD were assigned 1:1:1 to receive PIO 15 mg, EMPA 10 mg, or a combination (PIO 15 mg plus EMPA 10 mg) daily for 24 weeks. Liver fat fraction and stiffness were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), respectively. Combination therapy resulted in the largest reduction in liver fat and stiffness among treatment groups. Participants experiencing a relative reduction ≥ 30% or an absolute reduction ≥ 5% in liver fat were the most prevalent in the combination group (100.0% vs. 57.1% in PIO and 87.5% in EMPA, p = 0.010). In addition, the combination group showed the highest proportion of individuals with a relative reduction ≥ 30% in liver fat and ≥ 20% in liver stiffness than the monotherapy groups (50.0% vs. 21.4% in PIO and 6.3% in EMPA, p = 0.029). Combination therapy did not induce the changes in subcutaneous fat deposition observed in the monotherapy groups, but it did show the most substantial reduction in visceral fat, concurrently showing the largest increase in adiponectin level across the three groups (p = 0.036). Combination therapy of PIO with EMPA showed synergistic benefits for MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes, compensating for the inadequate or unfavorable effects of monotherapies; ClincialTrials.gov number, NCT03646292.

  "abstract": "Intersystem medical error discovery (IMED) involves clinicians identifying errors that occurred outside of their facility while a patient was under another clinician's care. Despite its major implications for safety and quality of care, explicit guidance is limited. Given the complexity of disorders and specialization within otolaryngology, IMED is a considerable concern, yet little is known about current practices or management strategies. To explore otolaryngologists' perceptions and practices around feedback and reporting of IMED and to identify strategies for preventing or responding to these errors. This qualitative study used semistructured, virtual interviews of 24 otolaryngologists with expertise in patient safety and quality improvement across the US from July to October of 2023. Purposive sampling ensured diversity in subspecialty, career stage, geography, practice context, and demographics. Otolaryngologist perceptions of IMED, encompassing barriers and facilitators to providing feedback or reporting IMED, and strategies for improving practices. Analysis followed an iterative inductive approach of interpretive description. Among the 24 participants (median [IQR] age, 51 [43-59] years; 13 [54%] female), several barriers, facilitators, and strategies emerged. Barriers included logistical (eg, lack of proximity, unavailable contact information, time constraints), psychosocial (eg, interpersonal discomfort, fear of retaliation, burnout), and structural factors (eg, fragmented systems, lack of incentives, leadership modeling, perceived conflict of interest). Facilitators that were associated with increased feedback or reporting included severe, egregious, fraudulent, or repetitive errors and preexisting relationships with the involved clinician. Most participants believed that IMED was inadequately addressed, with proposed strategies encompassing feedback training, standardized guidelines, interoperable medical records, oversight by national or state bodies, and intersystem safety reporting mechanisms. This qualitative study shows that the absence of standardized processes and resources hampers effective responses to IMED, such as feedback and reporting. While egregious errors or preexisting relationships may trigger action, opportunities exist to enhance clinical practice and policies across health systems.",

  "abstract": "Placental DNA methylation varies across gestation and is associated with obstetrical complications. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma could provide a noninvasive approach to study placental DNA methylation in ongoing pregnancies. However, research on maternal cfDNA methylation is limited and technologically challenging. Therefore, we aimed to investigate DNA methylation in maternal cfDNA and placental tissues across gestation using the innovative methylation DNA sequencing (MeD-seq) technology. Secondly, we explored the origins of methylation differences in maternal cfDNA across gestation, and aimed to identify gestational age-associated placental DNA methylation markers directly in cfDNA. We longitudinally collected maternal cfDNA in all three trimesters and at birth (n = 10), alongside placental tissues from first trimester, second trimester and term pregnancies (all n = 10), and used previously collected maternal blood buffy coat samples (n = 20). Different placental cell types, including syncytiotrophoblasts/cytotrophoblasts (SCTs/CTBs) (n = 10), extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) (n = 7) and syncytial knotting (SK) (n = 3), and maternal cell types including spiral arteries (n = 3) and endometrial epithelium (n = 3), were isolated using laser capture microdissection. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified in cfDNA from pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 6) ranged from 798 to 2163 in first and third trimesters, respectively. Gradual DNA methylation changes were observed across gestation in cfDNA, placental tissues and trophoblasts. We showed an increase in DMRs in cfDNA, that overlap with DNA methylation in placental tissues and especially trophoblasts, and in DNA methylation of placenta-specific markers across gestation, reflecting an increased placental-originated cfDNA fraction. Among 110 DMRs between first trimester and term placental tissues, those related to NXPH4, EPS8L2, AMOTL1 and IRX2 had the strongest association with gestational age in cfDNA, for which comparable associations were found in SCTs/CTBs. These DMRs were all hypomethylated in maternal buffy coat samples. This study indicates the feasibility of identifying gestational age-dependent placental DNA methylation marks in maternal cfDNA and can serve as reference for future studies.",

  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the digestive system worldwide, with its mortality ranking second among all cancers. Studies have indicated that disruptions in circadian rhythm (CR) are associated with the occurrence of various cancers; however, the relationship between CR and CRC requires further evidence, and research on the application of CR in CRC is still limited. In this study, we employed both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the dysregulation of CR in patients with CRC. By constructing a CR subtype classifier, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the prognostic significance, the status of the tumor microenvironment, and response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy between different CR clusters. Furthermore, we developed a CR scoring system (CRS) using machine learning to predict overall survival and identified several genes as potential targets affecting CRC prognosis. Our findings revealed significant alterations in CR genes and status between CRC and normal tissues using bulk and single-cell transcriptome sequencing. Patients with CRC could be categorized into two distinct CR clusters (CR cluster 1 and 2). The prognosis of CR cluster 2, with higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis scores, was significantly worser than that of CR cluster 1. These clusters exhibited distinct levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. CR cluster 2 with a notably higher proportion of patients with microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H), potentially benefit from ICB therapy. The proportion of patients belonging to consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) in CR cluster 2 was also notably higher than in CR cluster 1. Additionally, the CRS combined with tumor stage demonstrated superior overall survival prediction efficacy compared to traditional tumor stage. We revealed a potential link between model genes (LSAMP, MS4A2, NAV3, RAB3B, SIX4) and the disruption of CR and patient prognosis. This study not only provide new insights into the assessment of CR status in CRC patients but also develop a prognosis model based on CR-related genes, offering a new tool for personalized risk assessment in CRC.",

  "abstract": "Persistent obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) following adenotonsillectomy is a frequently encountered challenge for clinicians including pediatricians, neurologists, otolaryngologists and sleep specialists, and if untreated poses severe health risks to children. This article evaluates the etiology and pathophysiology of persistent pediatric OSA. It also discusses the conditions that predispose some children to persistent OSA following adenotonsillectomy and reviews the different diagnostic modalities and various options for management of persistent pediatric OSA. A PubMed search was performed using the following terms in various combinations: persistent obstructive sleep apnea, pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, positive airway pressure, hypoglossal nerve stimulator, myofunctional therapy, nasal surgery, CPAP tolerance, obesity, Down syndrome, monteleukast, frenulectomy, bariatric surgery, drug induced sleep endoscopy, cine MRI. Persistent OSA following adenotonsillectomy is commonly seen in children. Understanding the anatomic and physiologic mechanisms at play is important to formulate specific management strategies. It is important to have a higher degree of suspicion for persistent OSA after an adenotonsillectomy in children with neurological comorbidities and obesity.",

  "abstract": "Hemorrhoidal disease (HD) affects 2-20% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) but treatment recommendations are scarce due to fear of higher morbidity in these patients. Currently, there is almost no data regarding nonsurgical treatment for HD in patients with IBD. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of office-based procedures for HD in patients with IBD. A Portuguese multicenter retrospective study of patients with IBD undergoing office-based treatment for HD between July 2013 and December 2021 was performed. Data regarding the patients' IBD (type, disease location, medication, endoscopic remission) and HD (clinical success, recurrence, complications) were analyzed. A total of 129 patients were included, 90 with ulcerative colitis and 37 with Crohn's disease. Only 55% of patients presented endoscopic remission and 18% were under biologics. Additionally, 77 patients underwent rubber band ligation (RBL), 44 underwent polidocanol injection, and 8 had both treatments, for a total of 304 procedures. The treatment of HD was effective in 88% of patients, of which 16% relapsed (mean follow-up time of 55.3 ± 34.5 months). Complications were described in 17 (5.6%) procedures, 2 (0.66%) requiring invasive treatment. There were no cases of suppuration, stenosis, or anal incontinence. Success, relapse, and complications were not associated with IBD features. Clinical success and recurrence were similar between RBL and polidocanol foam sclerotherapy (PFS). RBL had more complications than PFS (15.6% versus 2.6%). This study is the first to focus exclusively on office-based procedures for hemorrhoidal disease in patients with IBD, demonstrating similar efficacy to the general population and a low complication rate.",

  "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to examine how intermediate-risk factors affect the oncological outcomes of patients diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stage IB2 cervical cancer who do not undergo any adjuvant treatment. A multicentric retrospective study that involved 612 patients who were diagnosed with stage IA-IB2 cervical cancer at seven tertiary gynaecological oncology centres between 1993 and 2023 was conducted. A total of 232 patients were classified as FIGO 2018 stage IB2. Patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, parametrial or surgical border involvement, received adjuvant therapy and synchronous tumours were excluded from the present cohort. Therefore, the present study cohort consisted of 120 patients who had undergone radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Among the 120 patients, 89 (74.2%) had squamous cell cancer, 18 (15%) had adenocarcinoma, 2 (1.7%) had a mixed type tumour consisting of squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma and 11 (9.1%) had other types of tumours (adenosquamous cancer and glassy cell cancer). Deep cervical stromal invasion was found in 68 (56.7%) patients. The duration of patient follow-up varied from 1 to 246 months, with a median of 36 months. Overall, 6 patients (5%) experienced recurrence and 1 patient (0.8%) succumbed to the disease. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 94%, whereas the 3-year overall survival rate was 99%. The presence of deep cervical stromal invasion had a statistically significant impact on DFS (P=0.038). Deep cervical stromal invasion was found to be associated with recurrence in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. Hence, the present study demonstrated that the presence of deep cervical stromal invasion may be considered a key parameter in determining whether adjuvant treatment should be applied in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer.",

  "abstract": "Recent advancements in the understanding of the genetic background of genitourinary cancers allowed for a successful introduction of targeted antitumor agents to prostate cancer (PCa) treatment. Inhibitors of the poly ADP-ribose polymerase enzyme (PARPi) transformed the treatment landscape of metastatic prostate cancer, and being increasingly studied in earlier disease stages. However, they are associated with nonnegligible toxicity, therefore, we aimed to summarize their side-effect profile in patients with PCa. Hematologic toxicities, particularly anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia are among the most common and serious adverse events associated with PARPi, highlighting the need for regular blood count monitoring. Nonhematologic side effects, including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, are common, and can be mitigated with supportive interventions like dietary modifications, antiemetics, or stool management techniques. Special attention should be given to patients with therapy-resistant or persistent cytopenia, in whom bone marrow biopsy should be considered, as it can indicate myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. PARP inhibitors represent a major advancement in the management of metastatic prostate cancer, offering a significant survival benefit in applicable cases. However, patients need to be carefully selected and informed, to allow for optimal balancing between the benefits and nonneglectable risks of severe toxicities. Better understanding of PARPi toxicity profile can improve personalized decision-making and enhance treatment compliance, through raising patients' awareness about the possible side effects of PARPi.",

  "abstract": "Cervical gunshot injuries, although rare, carry a significant risk of vertebral artery injuries (VAIs), which can lead to complex neurological and vascular complications. Effective management requires individualized strategies tailored to the clinical presentation and associated injuries. This study presents three cases of civilian cervical gunshot wounds involving VAIs and reviews the literature to highlight optimal management approaches. Three male patients, aged 24, 41, and 44, presented with cervical gunshot wounds and varying degrees of spinal cord and vertebral artery injuries. Two patients were managed conservatively with close monitoring, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care due to the absence of progressive neurological deficits or active bleeding. The third patient underwent emergency surgical decompression and vertebral artery clipping to control massive hemorrhage and prevent further neurological deterioration. Where feasible, endovascular treatment was prioritized due to its lower complication rates compared to open surgery. Follow-up revealed diverse outcomes, ranging from paraplegia to quadriparesis, highlighting the variable presentations and long-term consequences associated with these injuries. The third patient developed a delayed arteriovenous fistula (AVF) two years post-injury, which was successfully treated with endovascular embolization. Civilian cervical gunshot injuries involving the vertebral artery require individualized treatment plans. Conservative management may be appropriate for clinically stable cases, while surgical or endovascular interventions are crucial for managing vascular instability or progressive neurological deficits. Long-term follow-up is essential to detect and address delayed complications such as pseudoaneurysms or AVFs. This case series underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, involving neurosurgery, vascular surgery, otolaryngology, and interventional radiology, to optimize outcomes and deliver comprehensive care.",

  "abstract": "Pancreaticobiliary maljunction (PBM) is a rare cause of recurrent pancreatitis. During the past 10 years, treatment protocols for PBM have been progressively improved and revised; however, the latest therapeutic strategies have not been comprehensively summarized in the literatures. Herein, we present a typical case of PBM-related recurrent pancreatitis which highlights the role of PBM in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and prompts us to revisit and optimize current therapeutic strategies for PBM. A 59-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain, vomiting and cessation of defecation. The patient had an previous episode of pancreatitis three years ago. Laboratory tests revealed an elevated blood amylase level of 4,418.2 U/L (normal range, 35-135 U/L) and an upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan suggested the possibility of pancreatitis. After treatment with dietary restriction, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, inhibition of pancreatic fluid secretion, and rehydration, the patient was relieved of the abdominal pain, and the blood amylase level decreased to 118.8 U/L. However, 6 months after discharge, the patient was readmitted to the hospital because of abdominal pain. Laboratory tests showed that amylase level was >1,200.0 U/L. An upper abdominal CT scan and an upper abdominal dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) scan indicated a possibility of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). An ultrasonographic endoscopy showed the presence of PBM and the histopathologic findings of the pancreas obtained were the key basis for our diagnosis of PBM, as well as our final exclusion of AIP suggested by upper abdominal CT and upper abdominal dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Considering the patient's recurrent episodes of PBM-associated pancreatitis, we suggest that the patient could undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgery. However, the patient refused to undergo ERCP and surgery, was discharged from the hospital after experiencing relief of abdominal pain, and continued to be followed up in the outpatient clinic. Based on a case of PBM-related recurrent pancreatitis diagnosed using ultrasonographic endoscopy, we comprehensively reviewed PBM-related literatures. In addition to the classical therapeutic strategy of selecting different surgical procedures based on the morphology of the extrahepatic bile ducts, ERCP, a minimally invasive treatment, has unique advantages in PBM treatment. For symptomatic patients with PBM, ERCP can significantly reduce patient discomfort and facilitate favorable surgical conditions. Furthermore, when the effect of surgery is unclear, or patients do not wish to undergo surgery, ERCP can be used as a complementary or palliative treatment option to provide patients with more therapeutic possibilities. In this study, we propose and describe a new treatment strategy for PBM: combining traditional radical surgical program with ERCP to provide useful experiences and references for future treatment of PBM.",

  "abstract": "This research investigates the relationships between the composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) and the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in older adults with hypertension. Utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to investigate the potential mediating role of the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in these relationships. A cohort of 5,276 participants, aged 65 years or older and diagnosed with hypertension, was extracted from the NHANES database. The main outcomes examined were the odds of CVD and mortality, utilizing data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to evaluate the relationship between CDAI and CVD. Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were utilized to analyze the relationship between CDAI and mortality. Mediation analysis was conducted to assess the potential intermediary role of TyG-related indicators-specifically TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR- in the connection between CDAI and mortality. The mean CDAI for the study participants was 1.88 ± 3.90, and the average age was 74.15 ± 5.96 years. During an average follow-up duration of 109.51 months, 4,712 cases of CVD and 725 recorded deaths were observed. In the fully adjusted models, CDAI showed a negative association with both CVD (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.94, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 0.92-0.97) and mortality (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93-0.97). Mediation analysis indicated that the TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR indices accounted for 33.1%, 34.3%, and 19.1% of the relationship between CDAI and mortality, respectively. A higher CDAI demonstrated an inverse association with both CVD and mortality in elderly hypertensive individuals. The relationship was partially mediated by TyG-related indices, indicating that increased antioxidant intake may lead to improved health outcomes and a decreased risk of poor prognosis in this population.",

This meta-analysis aims to determine the impact of a procedure being performed in the initial learning curve has on the surgical results. A systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted up to March 2024, focusing on learning curves in prostatectomy. Primary outcome was biochemical recurrence rate (BCR); secondary outcomes included positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, continence, potency, operative time, blood loss, and complications (Clavien-Dindo classification). Bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool, and statistical analysis was done via Review Manager 5.4. Sixteen studies with 21,851 patients were included. No significant difference in BCR rates was found between initial and advanced learning curves (OR1.44;95%CI0.97,2.13;p = 0.07;I²=74%). No significant difference in continence rates was also observed. (RD-0.05;95CI-0.10,0.01;p = 0.08;I²=86%). However, advanced learning curves showed lower PSM rates (OR1.61;95%CI1.19,2.17;p = 0.002;I²=88%), higher potency, less blood loss, shorter operative time, and fewer complications. Although randomized trials are unlikely in this context, further high-quality prospective studies are needed to validate these findings. This meta-analysis highlights that achieving favorable outcomes in key pentafecta parameters-particularly potency, continence, and complication rates-increases with surgical experience. These findings emphasize the value of structured mentorship and establishing surgical volume benchmarks in training programs. Our analysis suggests that reaching a threshold of 100 cases may be necessary to consistently attain optimal functional and perioperative results.",

Although, these are considered rare diseases, it is important to note that some patients can present with features characteristic of more than one AILD, and these conditions are described as overlap syndromes (OS). Currently, there is lack of data regarding the epidemiology of OS. Majority of the data regarding the epidemiology of OS comes from single-center and small studies. The clinical features of OS are similar to the underlying AILD. There is also no consensus on how to manage patients with OS and the management is dependent on treating the underlying AILDs. Management of PBC involves use of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), while management of AIH involves the use of steroids and immunosuppressants. In this article, we will review the current literature on various OS and their respective diagnostic criteria. This article will also discuss epidemiology, clinical features, prognosis as well as outcomes among patients with various OS.",

  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have transformative potential in enhancing diagnostics, treatment planning, and patient management. However, their application in pediatric otolaryngology remains limited as the unique physiological and developmental characteristics of children require tailored AI applications, highlighting a gap in knowledge. To provide a narrative review of current literature on the application of AI in pediatric otolaryngology, highlighting knowledge gaps, associated challenges and future directions. ML models have demonstrated efficacy in diagnosing conditions such as otitis media, adenoid hypertrophy, and pediatric obstructive sleep apnea through deep learning-based image analysis and predictive modeling. AI systems also show potential in surgical settings such as landmark identification during otologic surgery and prediction of middle ear effusion during tympanostomy tube placement. Telemedicine solutions and large language models have shown potential to improve accessibility to care and patient education. The principal challenges include flawed generalization of adult training data and the relative lack of pediatric data. AI holds significant promise in pediatric otolaryngology. However, its widespread clinical integration requires addressing algorithmic bias, enhancing model interpretability, and ensuring robust validation across pediatric population. Future research should prioritize federated learning, developmental trajectory modeling, and psychosocial integration to create patient-centered solutions.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep quality, anxiety, and depression among perioperative caregivers of children with tethered cord syndrome. A cross-sectional study design was employed to recruit primary caregivers of children undergoing surgery for tethered cord syndrome from Fujian Children's Hospital between February 2022 and December 2023. Participants were required to complete some questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and the Self-Rating Depression Scale. Statistical analyses like chi-square tests, t-tests, and logistic regression were carried out to evaluate the associations between sleep quality, anxiety, and depression. A total of 149 caregivers were included in the study and completed all the questionnaires. The findings indicated that the prevalence of sleep disorders among caregivers was 31.5%. Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive association between anxiety and depression. Multifactorial regression analysis identified younger age of the child, presence of comorbidities, extended duration in a prone position postoperatively, and prolonged caregiving time as independently significant factors contributing to sleep disorders in caregivers. The study determined the occurrence of sleep disorders among primary caregivers of children with tethered cord syndrome. Furthermore, where the young age of the child, the presence of comorbidities, the time the child spent in a prone position after the operation, and the time spent caring for the child were significant factors. Future studies should explore the potential mechanisms and causal connections between caregiver sleep disorders and these crucial factors.",

  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o have shown promise in advancing medical decision-making and education. However, their performance in Spanish-language medical contexts remains underexplored. This study evaluates the effectiveness of single-agent and multi-agent strategies in answering questions from the EUNACOM, a standardized medical licensure exam in Chile, across 21 medical specialties. GPT-4o was tested on 1,062 multiple-choice questions from publicly available EUNACOM preparation materials. Single-agent strategies included Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Self-Reflection, and MED-PROMPT, while multi-agent strategies involved Voting, Weighted Voting, Borda Count, MEDAGENTS, and MDAGENTS. Each strategy was tested under three temperature settings (0.3, 0.6, 1.2). Performance was assessed by accuracy, and statistical analyses, including Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests, were performed. Computational resource utilization, such as API calls and execution time, was also analyzed. MDAGENTS achieved the highest accuracy with a mean score of 89.97% (SD = 0.56%), outperforming all other strategies (p < 0.001). MEDAGENTS followed with a mean score of 87.99% (SD = 0.49%), and the CoT with Few-Shot strategy scored 87.67% (SD = 0.12%). Temperature settings did not significantly affect performance (F2,54 = 1.45, p = 0.24). Specialty-level analysis showed the highest accuracies in Psychiatry (95.51%), Neurology (95.49%), and Surgery (95.38%), while lower accuracies were observed in Neonatology (77.54%), Otolaryngology (76.64%), and Urology/Nephrology (76.59%). Notably, several exam questions were correctly answered using simpler single-agent strategies without employing complex reasoning or collaboration frameworks. Multi-agent strategies, particularly MDAGENTS, significantly enhance GPT-4o's performance on Spanish-language medical exams, leveraging collaboration to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, simpler single-agent strategies are sufficient to address many questions, high-lighting that only a fraction of standardized medical exams require sophisticated reasoning or multi-agent interaction. These findings suggest potential for LLMs as efficient and scalable tools in Spanish-speaking healthcare, though computational optimization remains a key area for future research.",

  "abstract": "Early-onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC), defined as being diagnosed before the age of 50 years, is becoming increasingly prevalent. Among these patients, synchronous early-onset colorectal liver metastases (EO-CRLM) have emerged as a leading cause of mortality. This study aims to investigate the epidemiology, clinicopathological characteristics, and survival outcomes related to synchronous EO-CRLM to provide a clearer understanding of the challenges faced by patients with synchronous EO-CRLM. The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with synchronous CRLM diagnosed from 2010 to 2019. Patients were then stratified by age of onset: EO-CRLM (younger than 50 years old) and late-onset colorectal liver metastases (LO-CRLM) (50 years old or older). The incidence, limited-duration prevalence rates (over a 10-year period), clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Among 115,422 patients with CRLM, EO-CRLM and LO-CRLM were observed in 17,536 (15.2%) patients and in 97,886 (84.8%) patients, respectively. The annual age-adjusted incidence of EO-CRLM increased from 0.48 to 0.69 per 100,000 population from 2010 to 2019 [average annual percentage change (AAPC): 5.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.1 to 6.1], significantly faster than that of LO-CRLM (AAPC difference: 3.5, 95% CI: 2.5 to 4.5; P<0.001). The 10-year limited-duration prevalence for EO-CRLM increased from 0.0004% in 2010 to 0.0020% in 2019 (AAPC: 15.7, 95% CI: 10.2 to 21.5). A comparison of the clinicopathological features revealed that, compared with LO-CRLM, EO-CRLM patients were more likely to reside in urban areas, have higher rates of high school completion, have higher income, and be covered by private insurance/managed care. Genetic analysis revealed EO-CRLM with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high had the largest increase of AAPC of 28.7 (95% CI: 13.1 to 46.3) compared to MSI-low and microsatellite stability (MSS) (P<0.001). Similarly, EO-CRLM patients had a rapid rise in Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations with AAPC of 10.6 (95% CI: 8.8 to 12.5). Compared with LO-CRLM, EO-CRLM was associated with improved OS in inverse probability of treatment weighting-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratio: 0.876, 95% CI: 0.838 to 0.915; P<0.001). The incidence of EO-CRLM has increased rapidly, and represents a distinct population in terms of socioeconomic and clinicopathological characteristics. Among this cohort, the prognosis of patients with EO-CRLM was favorable compared to that of patients with LO-CRLM.",

Two hundred forty clinical-vignette style MCQs were sourced from BoardVitals Otolaryngology and OTOQuest, covering a range of otolaryngology subspecialties (n = 40 for each). The E-GPT-A was developed using targeted instructions and customized to otolaryngology. The performance of E-GPT-A was compared against top-performing and widely used artificial intelligence (AI) LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 2.0, and Claude 2.1. Accuracy was assessed across subspecialties, varying question difficulty tiers, and in diagnostics and management. E-GPT-A achieved an overall accuracy of 74.6%, outperforming GPT-3.5 (60.4%), Claude 2.0 (61.7%), Claude 2.1 (60.8%), and GPT-4 (68.3%). The model performed best in allergy and rhinology (85.0%) and laryngology (82.5%), whereas showing lower accuracy in pediatrics (62.5%) and facial plastics/reconstructive surgery (67.5%). Accuracy also declined as question difficulty increased. The average correct response percentage among otolaryngologists and otolaryngology trainees was 71.1% in the question set. This pilot study using the E-GPT-A demonstrates the potential benefits of domain-specific customizations of language models for otolaryngology. However, further development, continuous updates, and continued real-world validation are needed to fully assess the capabilities of LLMs in otolaryngology.",

  "abstract": "Despite a significant reduction in neonatal mortality due to advances in neonatal care, preterm birth (PTB) continues to pose a challenge due to the escalating incidence of long-term complications, which refer to health issues that persist or emerge beyond the immediate neonatal period. The impact of PTB, particularly in extremely preterm infants born before 28 weeks of gestational age, is not confined to the early years but extends across the lifespan, influencing physical, cognitive, and social development, as well as long-term health outcomes. These complications, which often persist from childhood into adulthood, span multiple systems and create a broad spectrum of health concerns. This comprehensive narrative review of literature delves into the breadth of well-characterized long-term complications associated with PTB, including neurodevelopmental, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, and endocrine system disorders. By providing health care providers with a holistic understanding of the potential complications following PTB, this review aims to summarize the current literature and underscore the value of long-term monitoring strategies and proactive evaluations of this population. Our objective is to foster a clinical approach that anticipates these complications, enabling early interventions and better management of these at-risk infants.",

  "abstract": "To determine whether 6 months of combined androgen blockade (CAB) treatment would result in metabolic changes of hippocampus and whether metabolic changes correlate with changes in cognition in patients with advanced prostate cancer (PCa). This is an observational study. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was used to observe the changes in the ratios of N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) and choline-containing compounds/creatine (Cho/Cr) on the bilateral hippocampus for the patients before and 6 months after CAB treatment. Cognitive function was also assessed by the Beijing version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-BJ) at the above two time points. Additionally, a certain number of matched individuals undergoing physical examination were selected as the control group. CAB group comprised 25 patients with advanced PCa completing follow-up, while control group had 22 healthy controls. Prior to CAB, no significant differences existed in MoCA-BJ scores (including sub-scores) or bilateral hippocampal NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios between groups. Six months after CAB, CAB group exhibited marked declines in MoCA-BJ total score, delayed recall, visuospatial/executive, and attention functions, alongside reduced bilateral hippocampal NAA/Cr and elevated left hippocampal Cho/Cr (P < 0.05).The results of multiple linear regression indicate a positive correlation between NAA/Cr in the left hippocampus and MoCA-BJ total score (β = 4.66, P < 0.001), as well as delayed recall function (β = 2.76, P < 0.001). Mediation analysis confirms that testosterone influences the MoCA-BJ total score and delayed recall function by affecting NAA/Cr in the left hippocampus. The impact of advanced PCa on cognitive performance could be negligible. However, patients experienced secondary hippocampal injury after CAB, which further led to cognitive dysfunction.",

There are several management options, including laryngoplasty injections and endoscopic laser surgery. We aimed to review the clinical presentations, investigations, comorbidities, management options, recurrence, and outcomes of patients with type 1 LC in our pediatric tertiary center. Six patients with LC type 1 were included in this case series. Their mean age was 22.5 months [standard deviation (SD): 17.1]. All patients were male, except for one. The mean weight was 12.2 kg (SD: 5.3). The mean height was 84.2 cm (SD: 23.9). All patients experienced cough and choking with feeding. Of the six patients, five had no airway symptoms and one had a stridor. In our tertiary care hospital, we initially managed patients with type 1 LC with hyaluronic acid injections for a few months, depending on the severity of the condition, followed by follow-up of the patient. If coughing and/or choking reoccur or persists, surgical repair is the next management option. Although conservative therapy has been useful for 36% of patients with type 1 LC, endoscopic surgical repair remains the optimal management choice. We advocate for injection laryngoplasty as a trial to confirm the diagnosis and anticipated benefit from endoscopic surgical repairs as it offers less invasive management option and decreases the risk of developing potentially life-threatening complications. Type 1 LC is a rare congenital condition that can be managed using injections. However, endoscopic laser repair remains the gold standard treatment for type 1 LC. The risk of recurrence after initial hyaluronic acid administration is high; however, recurrent symptoms can be treated with endoscopic laser repair.",

Risk of bias was assessed with the QUIPS tool. Studies were from eight countries between 2001 and 2018. Individual participant data were sought for eligible studies that reported mid-trimester (defined between 16 and 26 weeks) transvaginal sonographic cervical length and also gestational age at birth in asymptomatic women with twin pregnancy. The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks. Among 29 eligible studies, authors of 17 studies provided individual participant data for 6437 women with a twin pregnancy (69.1% of individual participant data). Mean cervical length measurement was 39 mm (SD=9, range 1-74 mm). 2889 women (44.9%) delivered before 37 weeks' gestation, and 934 (14.9%) delivered before 34 weeks. Each 1 mm increase in cervical length was associated with a 4.0% reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks (hazard ratio 0.96 (95% confidence interval 0.95 to 0.97)), and a 6.8% reduction in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestation (0.93 (0.92 to 0.95)). The prognostic value remained stable in models adjusting for different sets of variables.

However, the clinical translation of DC vaccines encounters significant challenges, such as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the sub-optimal DC function and vaccine efficacy in vivo. In this review, our investigation has uncovered the latest developments in DC vaccines and their potential in cancer immunotherapy, with a special emphasis on the integration of nanotechnology. Several types of nanomaterials, including protein cage nanoparticles (NPs), biomimetic NPs, and targeted multifunctional NPs, have been developed to enhance the antigen presentation ability of DCs and their stimulatory effects on T cells. In addition, we have also summarized the synergistic anti-cancer effects of DC vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In addition, recent advances in nanotechnology have made it possible to develop novel biomarkers that can enhance the antigen presentation capacity of DCs and stimulate T cells. These biomarkers not only improve the accuracy and precision of DC vaccine design but also provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms of the DC-mediated immune response. Despite challenges pertaining to technical complexities and individual adaptation in the design and production of DC vaccines, personalized immunotherapy based on DCs is expected to become an important part of cancer treatment with rapid developments in biotechnology and immunology. This review provides new perspectives and potential solutions for the optimal design and application of DC vaccines in cancer therapy.",

  "abstract": "Meckel's diverticulum (MD), the most prevalent congenital anomaly of the GI tract, arises from incomplete obliteration of the vitelline duct during embryogenesis. Though often asymptomatic, MD can cause complications like bleeding, obstruction, or inflammation. Diagnosing MD in adults is difficult due to its rarity and symptom overlap with other GI conditions. Modern imaging, particularly the technetium-99m pertechnetate scan (Meckel's scan), has improved detection capabilities. This case report explores an adult with obscure GI bleeding linked to MD, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A 42-year-old male presented with a short history of melena and visible red blood in his stools. Initial esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy at an outside facility failed to identify the bleeding source. Laboratory tests showed severe anemia, prompting a transfusion of packed red blood cells. Despite treatment for a concurrent Clostridium difficile infection, bleeding continued. Further tests, including capsule endoscopy, computed tomography angiography (CTA), mesenteric angiography, and a repeat EGD extending to the jejunum, revealed no clear cause. Due to persistent bleeding, a Meckel's scan was performed, showing mid-abdominal uptake suggestive of MD. Exploratory laparotomy confirmed MD with mesenteric adhesions, and surgical resection of the affected bowel segment was carried out. The patient recovered smoothly and was discharged post-surgery without issues. While a frequent cause of GI bleeding in children, MD is often overlooked in adults due to its rarity and vague symptoms, such as bleeding, obstruction, or inflammation. The Meckel's scan, which identifies ectopic gastric mucosa, is less effective in adults than in children but remains useful. Surgical resection is the standard treatment for symptomatic MD. This case emphasizes the importance of considering MD in the differential diagnosis of unexplained GI bleeding when routine tests are inconclusive. Timely diagnosis and intervention are essential to reduce ongoing blood loss and complications. This report highlights the diagnostic difficulties of obscure GI bleeding in adults and supports a multidisciplinary approach to improve outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Background Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the sinonasal mucosa with a propensity for postoperative recurrence despite surgical intervention. Understanding the factors contributing to recurrence is crucial for optimizing treatment outcomes. Study aim This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess demographic, clinical, pathological, and procedural factors associated with postoperative recurrence in AFRS patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Methodology Medical charts of 76 AFRS patients who underwent FESS between January 2008 and August 2021 at Prince Sultan Military Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were reviewed. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, surgical complications, histopathological findings, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Statistical analysis included the chi-square test and t-test. Results Relapse was observed in 42 (55.3%) patients. Significant predictors of relapse included younger age (24 ± 9 years in relapsing patients vs. 37 ± 17 years in non-relapsing patients, p < 0.001*), shorter time from presentation to surgery (229.8 ± 303.3 days in relapsing patients vs. 883.9 ± 1145.9 days in non-relapsing patients, p = 0.001*), and certain presenting symptoms such as facial swelling (p < 0.001*). Positive intraoperative cultures were more common in relapsing patients (73.3% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.029), and orbital extension was significantly associated with relapse (73.1% vs. 26.9%, p = 0.024). Surgical complications were more frequent among relapsing patients, although not statistically significant (85.7% vs. 52.2%, p = 0.089). Conclusions Our study highlights the multifactorial nature of postoperative recurrence in AFRS. Younger age, shorter time from presentation to surgery, specific severe presenting symptoms, positive intraoperative cultures, and orbital extension are significantly associated with higher relapse rates in AFRS patients. These findings highlight the need for tailored management strategies to reduce relapse rates, including aggressive and prolonged medical therapy, comprehensive preoperative assessments, and meticulous surgical and postoperative care.",

The development of interventions to achieve universal virologic suppression and eliminate transmission will require a deeper understanding of the individual and social processes that drive antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence and consequent viral nonsuppression.MethodsWe used a semistructured interview-based case-study approach to characterize changes across 3 time points in the lived contexts of 11 adolescents and young adults (aged 15-24 years) from intervention and control arms of a longitudinal HIV intervention trial in rural Kenyan and Ugandan communities. We sought to determine commonalities among those who never virally suppressed, those who became nonsuppressed, and those who moved from nonsuppression to viral suppression, exploring social and behavioral micro-processes or causal chains observed among individuals who share these trajectories.ResultsWe found that supportive family environments, high-quality service provision, and residential and partnership stability free of violence, or that permitted freedom to move and maintain extensive social ties both inside and outside one's immediate community, enabled ART adherence. We also found that several factors combine to have effects beyond each individual factor taken singly, for example, medication side effects were influenced by food insecurity; disclosure was most effective with individuals around whom one may potentially take medication, such as co-resident partners; and mobility compromised adherence when patients did not know how or where to access care in new places.RecommendationsOur findings suggest that to improve virologic suppression, clinical care and interventions should include assessment and strategies to address food insecurity, ART disclosure, and home-based violence from intimate partners or other family members. When such factors are present, we suggest referral for services, including violence prevention and protection services, and food provision for those patients who do not adhere because of medication side effects amplified by lack of food. We further recommend that clinics coordinate regionally to anticipate mobility, facilitate transfer of care to other areas, and ensure clients have access to information about care clinics elsewhere in the region. Longitudinal Case Studies Tracking HIV Viral Suppression or Nonsuppression From Rural East African Adolescents and Young Adults With HIVResearch has identified many associations between socioeconomic factors and human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) nonsuppression, but few qualitative studies have defined how these factors interrelate and lead to HIV nonsuppression.

  "abstract": " Effective collaboration between general practitioners (GPs) and nephrologists is crucial for optimizing the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TOSCA-CKD project (Treatment Optimization and Standard of Care Adherence in CKD Primary Care) aimed to evaluate the implementation of guidelines and the use of nephroprotective therapies in primary care.   Clinical data were collected from the medical records of GPs across 12 Italian regions. The data were analyzed at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T6) of collaboration with nephrologists. During this observational period, GPs were involved in remote education programs, which included expert-led webinars and clinical case-based learning.   A total of 76 GPs and 9 nephrologists were involved in the study, evaluating a cohort of 124,759 patients. There was an increase of 23.3% in the uACR test from T0 to T6 (3.0% vs. 3.7%; p < 0.001). Similarly, there was an increase of 15.2% in the use of eGFR from T0 to T6 (29.7% vs. 34.2%; p < 0.001). The rate of CKD diagnosis increased by 17.5% among patients with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (from 4% to 4.7%) and by 40% among patients with ACR > 30 mg/g (from 0.5% to 0.7%). The use of ACEi/ARBs remained stable at approximately 50%, while the treatment with SGLT2i, the new standard of care according to the current CKD guidelines, increased by 29.8% (from 4.7% to 6.1%).   The TOSCA-CKD project demonstrated that GPs' remote educational program and a structured co-management approach significantly enhanced the early identification and improved the management of CKD in primary care.",

  "abstract": "Intragastric balloons (IGBs) are widely used as a temporary weight-loss measure to induce early satiety and delay gastric emptying. Despite their safety profile, rare complications such as migration and small bowel obstruction (SBO) may occur, particularly when follow-up for timely removal is neglected. We present a case of a 48-year-old female with a history of obesity who arrived at the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and obstipation of three days duration. Imaging revealed a dilated stomach and duodenum, with a fluid-filled IGB lodged in the proximal jejunum, causing SBO. Push enteroscopy was performed using a colonoscope, and the IGB was retrieved successfully from the jejunum into the stomach and removed entirely, avoiding the need for surgery. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged the following day. This case demonstrates an innovative approach to managing SBO caused by IGB migration. While surgery is typically the preferred method for small bowel impaction, endoscopic retrieval presents a viable, less invasive option. This article highlights the importance of gastroenterology consultation in managing migrated IGBs and reviews different techniques for endoscopic retrieval. We conclude that endoscopic management of migrated IGB causing SBO should be considered a first-line approach to minimize complications and shorten hospital stays, provided a backup surgical team is available.",

This study aimed to examine the current research state, frequently utilized research instruments, and factors impacting the oral health quality of life in individuals with diabetes. Our review was conducted according to the PRISMA extended guidelines for scoping review. We conducted a literature review on the oral health and quality of life of diabetic patients using PubMed, Embase, and additional databases. This research proposal has been formally submitted to the Open Science Framework. Out of 3827 materials, merely 17 publications satisfied the review requirements for our study. The search period extended from the inception of the library until Feb 5, 2024. The research encompassed seven countries, including China, the United States, and Iran, utilizing the Oral Health Evaluation Index for the Elderly and the Oral Health Impact Scale as prevalent assessment instruments. The quality of life connected to oral health was predominantly low among diabetic patients, influenced by socio-demographic characteristics, oral health status, biochemical indicators, psychosocial elements, lifestyle choices, and oral-related factors. The oral health-related quality of life among diabetic patients is typically diminished. Oral health care professionals must devise strategies to promptly identify, assess, and manage the factors influencing the oral health-related quality of life in diabetic patients, while incorporating necessary preventive measures and screenings to enhance oral disease prevention in routine evaluations.",

  "abstract": "Intersystem medical error discovery (IMED) involves clinicians identifying errors that occurred outside of their facility while a patient was under another clinician's care. Despite its major implications for safety and quality of care, explicit guidance is limited. Given the complexity of disorders and specialization within otolaryngology, IMED is a considerable concern, yet little is known about current practices or management strategies. To explore otolaryngologists' perceptions and practices around feedback and reporting of IMED and to identify strategies for preventing or responding to these errors. This qualitative study used semistructured, virtual interviews of 24 otolaryngologists with expertise in patient safety and quality improvement across the US from July to October of 2023. Purposive sampling ensured diversity in subspecialty, career stage, geography, practice context, and demographics. Otolaryngologist perceptions of IMED, encompassing barriers and facilitators to providing feedback or reporting IMED, and strategies for improving practices. Analysis followed an iterative inductive approach of interpretive description. Among the 24 participants (median [IQR] age, 51 [43-59] years; 13 [54%] female), several barriers, facilitators, and strategies emerged. Barriers included logistical (eg, lack of proximity, unavailable contact information, time constraints), psychosocial (eg, interpersonal discomfort, fear of retaliation, burnout), and structural factors (eg, fragmented systems, lack of incentives, leadership modeling, perceived conflict of interest). Facilitators that were associated with increased feedback or reporting included severe, egregious, fraudulent, or repetitive errors and preexisting relationships with the involved clinician. Most participants believed that IMED was inadequately addressed, with proposed strategies encompassing feedback training, standardized guidelines, interoperable medical records, oversight by national or state bodies, and intersystem safety reporting mechanisms. This qualitative study shows that the absence of standardized processes and resources hampers effective responses to IMED, such as feedback and reporting. While egregious errors or preexisting relationships may trigger action, opportunities exist to enhance clinical practice and policies across health systems.",

Refining clinical stage groups, especially in the overabundant cN1/stage I group, has become important for treatment selection. To assess the prognostic importance of pretreatment lymph node (LN) characteristics to optimize case distribution and outcome homogeneity within the N classification system. This is an international multi-institutional retrospective prognostic cohort study. Analysis of human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma treated curatively from 4 institutions (International Collaboration of Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for N-Classification [ICON-N] dataset) provided a refined clinical staging proposal; an independent dataset (Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal [CHUM] dataset) validated the proposal. Neuroradiologists reviewed pretreatment computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for nodal features, including presence or absence of abnormal LN(s), retropharyngeal LN, laterality, number of abnormal LN, and imaging-detected extranodal extension (iENE). Data were collected from February to May 2023, and data were analyzed from June to July 2023. Definitive chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy or definitive surgery with or without postoperative chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. The primary end point was overall survival. A Cox proportional hazards multivariable model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) and to derive an optimal clinical TNM stage classification (AHR-stage schema) incorporating the strongest prognostic nodal features within the UICC/AJCC eighth edition TNM framework after confirming the prognostication of iENE status. The performance (according to overall normalized scores and ranking) of the AHR-stage schema against the current UICC/AJCC eighth edition TNM staging system was evaluated for hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, prognostic importance, and sample size balance. Validation was performed in the CHUM dataset. The ICON-N dataset comprised 2053 patients, including 1898 (92.5%) with cN-positive disease and 155 (7.5%) with cN0 disease; a total of 298 (14.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 60.6 (9.3) years. iENE-positive disease was identified in 710 of 1898 patients with cN-positive disease (37.4%). The median (range) follow-up was 5.1 (0.1-14.7) years. iENE was the strongest prognostic nodal feature in multivariable analysis; the AHR for iENE-positive vs iENE-positive disease was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.96-3.03) in the ICON-N dataset and 2.04 (95% CI, 1.28-3.23) in the CHUM dataset (n = 451). Reclassifying iENE-positive cases 1 stratum higher for N categorization without altering iENE-negative cases yielded an AHR-stage schema that outperformed the current TNM staging system in disease-free and overall survival with a lower (ie, better) overall normalized score (2 vs 3). In this study, reclassifying each N category 1 stratum higher for iENE-positive disease resulted in better disease-free and overall survival. The proposed new classification outperformed the currently TNM staging system in risk stratification and may facilitate future clinical trial design, outcomes research, and patient care.",

  "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; The minimally invasive procedure of Laser-assisted Dacryocystorhinostomy (LDCR) has gained importance in the treatment of nasolacrimal duct obstruction, offering a potential alternative to traditional external and endonasal methods. This is an important topic in otolaryngology practice, as it offers an alternative to traditional endoscopic surgery. Due to the close anatomical proximity of the nose and the eye, addressing it requires collaboration within a multidisciplinary team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This study aims to evaluate the surgical effectiveness and factors influencing clinical outcomes. Anatomical issues such as nasal septum deviation and the size of the created ostium were assessed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; A total of 42 patients were included in the study, undergoing surgery on 46 nasolacrimal ducts. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at least 6 months post-surgery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Anatomic and functional success was achieved in 93.48% of the patients. In patients without septal deviation, there were 35 successful outcomes and 2 failures, compared to 18 successes and 1 failure in the group with septal deviation. The findings revealed no significant correlation between septal deviation and surgical success, indicating that other factors may be more influential. Patients with an average-sized ostium reported better clinical outcomes and fewer tearing symptoms, while those with a deviated septum experienced more intermittent tearing. The overall mean ostium width was 2.37 mm. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; LDCR proved effective with a significantly shorter surgical time, benefiting patients seeking a quick recovery. While factors like anatomical abnormalities and septal deviation were not statistically significant for surgical success, patients with anatomical disorders often reported slightly poorer functional outcomes. Analyzing etiological factors and ostium development will help refine surgical techniques and improve patient satisfaction.",

  "abstract": "Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of postoperative medicated mastoid cavity packing on healing outcomes following canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy compared to no packing. Methods This prospective observational study included 125 patients undergoing CWD mastoidectomy, matched for age and sex, and assigned to two groups. Group A (n=62) received medicated mastoid cavity packing containing ofloxacin, ornidazole, clobetasone propionate, and itraconazole on postoperative days 0, 10, and 20. Group B (n=63) received no postoperative packing. Healing outcomes were evaluated and compared between the groups on postoperative days 45, 75, and 105. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The groups were comparable in age and sex distribution. The packed group demonstrated significantly higher rates of complete epithelialization on day 45 (48.4% vs. 15.9%, p < 0.0001) and day 75 (72.6% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.007), with no difference observed by day 105. Graft uptake duration was similar between groups (76.94 days in Group A and 76.19 days in Group B). Granulation tissue, mucosal folds, and otorrhea were more frequent in the non-packed group (25.4%, 6.3%, and 4.8% vs 12.9%, 3.2%, and 3.2%, respectively) during early follow-up, though not statistically significant. Mean epithelialization time was significantly shorter in the packed group (84.0 vs. 92.8 days, p = 0.001). Conclusion Medicated mastoid cavity packing promotes earlier epithelialization following CWD mastoidectomy and is associated with a lower incidence of granulation tissue without affecting graft uptake. It offers particular benefits in low-resource settings by enhancing healing and reducing follow-up needs. Larger studies are warranted to establish standardized postoperative care protocols.",

In recent years, AS-IV has attracted considerable attention for its hepatoprotective properties, which are attributed to its low toxicity as well as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumour effects. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated its potential in the prevention and treatment of various liver diseases, including multifactorial liver injury, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. Given the promising hepatoprotective potential of AS-IV and the growing interest in its research, this review provides a comprehensive summary of the current state of research on the hepatoprotective effects of AS-IV, based on literature available in databases such as CNKI, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Web of Science. The hepatoprotective mechanisms of AS-IV are multifaceted, encompassing the inhibition of inflammatory responses, reduction of oxidative stress, improvement of insulin and leptin resistance, modulation of the gut microbiota, suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and induction of tumour cell apoptosis. Notably, key molecular pathways involved in these effects include Nrf2/HO-1, NF-κB, NLRP3/Caspase-1, JNK/c-Jun/AP-1, PPARα/FSP1 and Akt/GSK-3β/β-catenin. Toxicity studies indicate that AS-IV has a high level of safety. In addition, this review discusses the sources, physicochemical properties, and current challenges in the development and clinical application of AS-IV, providing valuable insights into its potential as a hepatoprotective agent in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries.",

  "abstract": "Adipocyte metabolism critically regulates systemic energy homeostasis, and its dysfunction contributes to obesity pathogenesis. Notably, elevated circulating branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) levels and impaired adipose tissue BCAA catabolism have been observed in both animal models and humans with obesity; however, the mechanisms underlying BCAA metabolism's regulation of adipocyte function remain incompletely understood. This review synthesizes recent advances in the roles of BCAA catabolic enzymes, their metabolites, and BCAAs themselves in modulating adipocyte metabolism, encompassing adipogenesis, lipid metabolism, and thermogenesis. Emerging evidence reveals that BCAA catabolism influences adipocyte metabolism through multiple pathways: by utilizing BCAAs as an energy substrate, and modulating signaling cascades via metabolites and unidentified mechanisms. Importantly, adipocyte BCAA catabolism directly impacts systemic BCAA clearance and plasma BCAA concentrations. Dietary interventions involving BCAA supplementation, restriction, or deprivation demonstrate diverse metabolic effects on adipocytes, mediated through key nutrient-sensing pathways including mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and general control nonderepressible kinase 2 (GCN2)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) signaling. We further discuss translational implications, evaluating therapeutic strategies targeting BCAA catabolism or dietary BCAA manipulation for obesity management.

  "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are increasingly being used to guide glucose management in the hospital. However, uncertainty regarding their accuracy in this setting remains. We conducted a nonrandomized, open-label, clinically blinded prospective trial of the Dexcom G6 Pro (G6P) and FreeStyle Libre Pro (FLP) in the inpatient setting among critically ill hospitalized patients (n = 40) requiring continuous intravenous insulin infusion. In parallel with CGM data, reference serum (Lab) glucose and point-of-care (POC) glucose values were obtained. On completion of the study, CGM and reference values were analyzed to assess CGM accuracy. A total of 1015 matched G6P-Lab pairs had a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 22.7%, 2369 G6P-POC pairs had an MARD of 22.9%, 1006 matched FLP-Lab pairs had an MARD of 25.2%, and 2353 FLP-POC pairs had an MARD of 27.0%. Both CGM systems demonstrated considerable inter-patient variability in sensor accuracy and tended to underestimate glucose in comparison with the reference values. Rarely were low reference values overestimated by either sensor. Factory-calibrated continuous glucose monitors may require accuracy validation and per-patient calibration for inpatient use in critically ill patients.",

  "abstract": "Pregnancy in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is well-known to be linked to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Although advancements in diabetes technology, especially hybrid closed-loop (HCL) and advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) systems, have greatly enhanced management for nonpregnant individuals with T1D, pregnant patients still represent a high-risk group that requires further research. Existing trials have shown mixed data in terms of clinically meaningful benefits in glycemic control, but these may be specific to the closed-loop system. Currently, there is one AHCL system approved and available for use in pregnancies complicated by diabetes in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia. However, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved closed-loop systems for use during pregnancy in the United States. Existing HCL/AHCL system use is off-label for pregnancy in the United States and often requires assistive techniques to target the tighter glucose levels needed during pregnancy. For patients struggling on multiple daily injections (MDIs) or sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT), studies have shown that HCL/AHCLs can reduce the burden of care and enable some people to achieve tighter glucose levels. This review aims to provide an overview of the existing evidence of closed-loop systems in pregnancies complicated by T1D and to discuss their implications and considerations with system use.",

  "abstract": "Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN) is a rare form of immune complex-mediated primary glomerular disease frequently coexisting with malignancies or autoimmune diseases. The kidney prognosis is extremely poor, with approximately 50% of patients progressing to end-stage kidney disease within 2-4 years after diagnosis. However, no established treatment currently exists. Here we describe a rare case of FGN diagnosed in a patient progressing from monoclonal gammopathy to multiple myeloma. The histopathological findings of the kidney biopsy were consistent with classical FGN and revealed no evidence of myeloma cast nephropathy. Albumin-dominant, Bence Jones protein-negative proteinuria further supported this diagnosis. The patient was successfully treated with anti-myeloma chemotherapies including autologous stem cell transplant, resulting in significant improvement in kidney function. Based on our experience, secondary FGN associated with plasma cell neoplasms may represent a rare entity that responds favorably to anti-myeloma therapies. Initial investigations to rule out coexistent plasma cell neoplasms are crucial for the optimal management of FGN patients.",

  "abstract": "Primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration plays an important role in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the benefits of such collaboration in patients with stage 5 CKD remain unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD across nine nephrology centers in Japan. The exposure of interest was primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration. We examined the association between primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration and clinical outcomes in adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD: dialysis initiation and cause-specific hospitalizations using the Fine-Gray models, which treat death and preemptive kidney transplantation and death and kidney replacement therapy as competing risk events, respectively. Of the 570 patients included in the analysis, 91 (16.0%) received primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration, whereas the remaining patients were treated by nephrologists alone. During a median follow-up of 1.4 years, 399 (70.0%) patients started dialysis, 11 (1.9%) received preemptive kidney transplantation, and 53 (9.3%) died. There were no significant between-group differences in dialysis initiation and CKD- and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] [95% confidence interval], 0.89 [0.64-1.23], 1.22 [0.78-1.90], and 0.95 [0.46-1.98], respectively). However, primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration was associated with a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization (adjusted SHR [95% confidence interval], 0.36 [0.15-0.87]). Our findings suggest that primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration in the management of stage 5 CKD is not associated with delayed dialysis initiation but is associated with a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization, indicating the potential benefits of primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration in stage 5 CKD.",

  "abstract": "Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome (APS) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects multiple endocrine glands. It can lead to various clinical manifestations. The primary objective of this review was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the clinical features and management strategies used in managing APS, based on a review of case reports. We emphasize disease pattern recognition and detection of atypical clinical signs, as well as the outcomes of various treatment modalities. Case reports from credible journals were searched in PubMed, resulting in a systematic literature review adopting the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. Of the 1173 records identified, 474 remained after duplicates were removed, and 49 full-text articles were reviewed. After further screening based on criteria such as associated disorders, patient age, follow-up, and treatment details, 12 articles were selected for the final analysis. The findings revealed that common endocrine dysfunctions in APS include Addison's disease and hypothyroidism, while non-endocrine manifestations, such as autoimmune encephalitis and pernicious anemia, can also occur. The most frequently adopted strategies were immunosuppressive and hormone therapies. The heterogeneity of APS indicates early diagnosis and individualized treatment strategies. Ultimately, this analysis identifies existing insufficiencies and provides recommendations for formulating standard operating procedures for the treatment of APS.",

  "abstract": "Our pilot study investigated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib (TOF) in patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), providing a new therapeutic option. This was a historical comparator, single-center study. Patients enrolled in our study were screened using the 2016 Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) criteria of MAS. MAS patients deemed suitable for TOF therapy were enrolled in the experimental group. The control group included MAS patients from Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital who had received biological and/or conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/csDMARDs) treatment in a similar period. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, MAS treatment response rates, and glucocorticoid discontinuation rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Serious adverse events such as thrombosis or severe infection were recorded. A total of 36 MAS patients were included-17 in the TOF treatment group and 19 in the b/csDMARDs control group. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. After six weeks, the proportion of febrile patients was significantly lower in the TOF group compared to the control group (11.8% [2/17] vs. 47.3% [9/19], P = 0.021). Significant reductions were also observed in C-reactive protein levels at week 6 (5.9% [1/17] vs. 36.8% [7/19], P = 0.026) and ferritin levels at week 12 (100.0% [17/17] vs. 26.3% [5/19], P = 0.023). The MAS treatment response rate was significantly higher in the TOF group at weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.023, respectively). Glucocorticoid discontinuation was more frequent in the TOF group, with a 12-week discontinuation rate of 100.0% (17/17) compared to 57.9% (11/19) in the control group (P = 0.002). No serious adverse events, including thrombosis or severe infections, were reported. Our results suggest that TOF may be as effective as or even better than b/csDMARDs, with a quicker and higher response rate in patients with MAS without severe adverse events. Key Points •Tofacitinib may be as effective or better than b/csDMARDs in MAS. •Tofacitinib may act at a quicker and higher response rate in MAS. •Tofacitinib might be an alternative therapeutic option for patients with MAS.",

  "abstract": "Adult-onset nesidioblastosis is an exceedingly rare yet significant cause of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. This condition is often associated to bariatric surgeries such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Characterized by abnormal β-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, its diagnosis presents a unique challenge due to overlapping features with insulinomas and post-bariatric hypoglycemia syndrome (PBHS). We report a 55-year-old woman with a history of gastric sleeve and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgeries who presented with a 1.5-year history of recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. Her symptoms, including blurred vision, tremors, and altered consciousness, persisted despite medical therapy with octreotide, acarbose, and nifedipine. Extensive imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic ultrasound, ruled out insulinomas, raising suspicion of non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome. The patient underwent laparoscopic subtotal distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation. Histopathological examination confirmed nesidioblastosis, revealing irregular islet distribution and β-cell hypertrophy. Post-surgery, the patient achieved normoglycemia without recurrence of hypoglycemic episodes during follow-up. This case highlights the complexity of diagnosing nesidioblastosis in adults, especially following bariatric surgeries. Nesidioblastosis involves β-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy driven by hormonal factors like GLP-1, whereas PBHS results from altered incretin patterns causing excessive insulin release. Advanced imaging and multidisciplinary collaboration are important for accurate diagnosis. Surgical management remains a cornerstone for refractory cases, as demonstrated in this patient's remarkable recovery. Nesidioblastosis is a rare condition but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia. This case highlights the importance of distinguishing nesidioblastosis from PBHS to ensure appropriate and effective management strategies.",

  "abstract": "Intracellular bacterial components represent an emerging tumor element that has recently been documented in multiple cancer types, yet their biological functions remain poorly understood. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a particularly aggressive malignancy lacking highly effective targeted treatments. Here, we explored the functional significance of intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in OSCC. Normal human oral keratinocytes (HOKs), HPV-transformed oral keratinocytes (IHGK), and three OSCC cell lines were transfected with ultrapure bacterial LPS. Cytotoxicity was assessed via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays. Production of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 was measured using ELISA. Impact on tumor progression was evaluated using cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tubulogenesis assays. Intracellular LPS-induced significant LDH release and increased secretion of IL-18 and IL-1β in IHGK and cancer cells, but not in normal HOKs, indicating selective cytotoxicity and pyroptosis. Notably, metastatic cancer cells exhibited enhanced invasive and vessel-like structures upon LPS exposure, while IHGK cells exhibited increased proliferation without changes in migration. Our findings suggest that intracellular LPS may not merely reside passively within the tumor milieu, but could contribute to OSCC progression by triggering noncanonical inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. This process may enhance pro-inflammatory signaling and more aggressive cellular phenotypes, especially in metastatic settings. Targeting intracellular LPS or its downstream inflammasome pathways may thus represent a promising therapeutic strategy for OSCC, warranting further in vivo and clinical investigations.",

  "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate self-management experiences among individuals with prediabetes and analyze their potential self-management needs, thereby informing strategies to enhance self-management efficacy and facilitate the development of evidence-based, personalized interventions. Twelve prediabetes patients from a physical examination center in Nanchong, China, were recruited using purposive sampling. An interpretive phenomenological research method was employed. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted to explore patients' self-management experiences. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically to develop the results. In addition, web-based information support and peer support facilitated patient self-management. Four overarching themes emerged: (1) cognitive limitations, (2) intrinsic motivation, (3) hurdles to overcome, (4) perceived social support. Revealed the debilitating effect of non-medical terminology expression on the potential harm of the disease, neglect of diagnosis and health education by healthcare providers exacerbated the lack of awareness of prediabetes among patients. The complex social environment (unhealthy food environment, heavy work pressure, etc.) confronts prediabetes with self-management dilemmas. It was also revealed that patients' behavioral change motivation was \"threat-benefit\" dual-driven and was strongly influenced by family ethics, with family culture significantly influencing health decision-making. In addition, web-based information support and peer support facilitate patient self-management. This study investigated the perceptions and self-management experiences of individuals with prediabetes, proposing targeted intervention strategies. Key recommendations include: (1) Healthcare providers' perceptions and attitudes toward prediabetes significantly influence patient engagement, necessitating standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols that emphasize disease progression risks during initial diagnosis to enhance clinical awareness; (2) Implementation of motivational interviewing (MI) techniques could effectively strengthen patients' intrinsic motivation for behavioral modification; (3) Multidimensional support systems should be established through AI-powered medical question-answering systems, standardized nutritional labeling regulations, family-involved health education programs, and peer-led \"health coach\" initiatives. These strategies provide a framework for developing comprehensive prediabetes management interventions aimed at improving self-management ability.",

  "abstract": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the main clinical feature of antisynthetase syndrome (ASS). In the absence of randomized controlled trials to guide therapy, treatment strategies are often extrapolated from other diseases, mainly systemic sclerosis (SSc). Our aim was to evaluate the dynamics of ILD severity following immunosuppressive treatment (IST) in ASS compared to SSc. A multicenter retrospective observational study. ASS (  = 22) and SSc (  = 32) subjects with ILD were included in the registries of three medical centers. All patients received ISTs. We analyzed changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide corrected for hemoglobin (DLCOc) after treatment initiation using linear mixed-effects models. Changes in high-resolution chest CT scans were analyzed by a radiologist blinded to clinical data. The median (interquartile range) age was 66 (59-71), 72% were females, and 81% of IST included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and pulmonary functions were similar between the groups. Among the ASS group, the mixed-effects models showed significant improvements in FVC% (  = 11.3,   < 0.01) and DLCOc% (  = 7.1,   = 0.015) after treatment initiation over time, while in the SSc group, there were no significant changes in FVC% (  = 0.4,   = 0.551) and DLCOc% (  = 0.8,   = 0.384). Changes in FVC% and DLCOc% were higher in the ASS group compared with SSc (  = 0.017 and   < 0.01, respectively), which persisted after adjustment to steroid use and in a sub-analysis of patients with serial pre- and post-IST pulmonary functions. Both groups had improved total CT scores after IST, without changes in other radiologic scores. Immunosuppressive treatment, mostly with MMF, was associated with significant improvement of FVC% and DLCOc% in ASS, compared to their stabilization only in SSc. This should encourage future randomized controlled studies of MMF in ASS patients. Antisynthetase syndrome (ASS) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the muscles, joints and lungs. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is also a less rare autoimmune disease that causes scarring of the skin and the lungs, for which there is more abundant clinical trial evidence to support treatment. For both diseases, immunosuppressive treatments are required, which are treatments that lower the activity of the body’s immune system. As there are no official treatment guidelines for managing ASS lung disease, doctors often rely on established treatments for SSc lung disease. For this reason, our aim was to assess how lung disease responds to immunosuppressive treatment in ASS compared to SSc. We looked back at data of 54 patients from three medical center. 22 patients had ASS lung disease and 32 patients had SSc lung disease, all treated with immunosuppressive therapy. We found that lung function has significantly improved in the ASS group after treatment. This improvement was greater than that observed in the SSc group. CT scans, which depict the changes in the relevant lung disease, showed improvements in both groups. Additionally, we identified markers that may help predict how patients with ASS will respond to immunosuppressive treatments. In summary, we found major improvements of ASS lung disease compared to SSc after starting immunosuppressive therapy, supporting the need for additional high-quality research that focus on ASS.",

A retrospective review was conducted on 19 patients with Bethesda III-V thyroid nodules who underwent ThyGeNEXT®+ThyraMIR® testing followed by total thyroidectomy with histopathology confirming thyroid cancer. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology, molecular test results, post-surgical histopathology and comprehensive genomic profiling reports (when available) were examined. Concordance was assessed by comparing pre-operative test results (mutations or malignant miRNA expression) to post-surgical histopathology. Discrepancies were further explored using Tempus xT genomic profiling for additional mutations and evaluation of tumor heterogeneity. The FNR was calculated accordingly. FNR was 10.5 % and there was a high positive concordance with 89.5 % of cases testing positive for mutations or malignant miRNA classifiers. TERT c.-146C>T, NRAS Q61R, and BRAF V600E were among mutations identified. Comprehensive genomic profiling clarified false negatives, revealing insights into the impact of tumor heterogeneity. The miRNA classifier proved effective in detecting malignancy, in cases with subthreshold and RAS mutations or without common genetic alterations. Reliable results were obtained from diverse specimen types. The low false-negative rate and positive concordance with histopathology highlights the utility of ThyGeNEXT® + ThyraMIR® in enhancing risk stratification and guiding personalized management of indeterminate thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.",

We hypothesized that metabolite quantification across the pulmonary vascular bed in connective tissue disease-associated (CTD-associated) PAH would identify transpulmonary gradients of pathobiologically relevant metabolites, in an exercise stage-specific manner. Sixty-three CTD patients with established or suspected PAH underwent exercise right heart catheterization. Using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, metabolites were quantified in plasma samples simultaneously collected from the pulmonary and radial arteries at baseline and during resistance-free wheeling, peak exercise, and recovery. We identified uptake and excretion of metabolites across the pulmonary vascular bed, unique and distinct from single vascular site analysis. We demonstrated the physiological relevance of metabolites previously shown to promote disease in animal models and end-stage human lung tissues, including acylcarnitines, glycolytic intermediates, and tryptophan catabolites. Notably, pulmonary vascular metabolite handling was exercise stage specific. Transpulmonary metabolite gradients correlated with hemodynamic endpoints largely during free-wheeling. Glycolytic intermediates demonstrated physiologic significance at peak exercise, including net uptake of lactate in those with more advanced disease. Contribution of pulmonary vascular metabolism to CTD-PAH pathogenesis and therapeutic candidacy of metabolism modulation must be considered in the context of physiologic stress.",

  "abstract": "This case report describes an 80-year-old woman with systemic sclerosis (SSc), complicated by interstitial lung disease (ILD) and new-onset pulmonary hypertension (PH), likely triggered by an atypical SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diagnosed with SSc in 2016 and previously stable ILD, she experienced clinical deterioration in 2023 with worsening respiratory failure and PH. Despite negative PCR and antigen tests, high anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels and CT findings were consistent with COVID-19-related organising pneumonia. Intravenous glucocorticoids led to partial symptom improvement, although ILD progression continued. The patient died in December 2023 from pneumococcal pneumonia. This case highlights the complex interaction between SSc and COVID-19, where overlapping mechanisms of endothelial injury and fibrosis may exacerbate pre-existing organ damage. It underscores the need for a multidisciplinary approach and timely interventions, including vaccination, early clinical assessment and appropriate immunosuppressive or antiviral treatments, to prevent severe infectious complications and halt disease progression in this high-risk patient population.",

  "abstract": "Opportunistic pathogen   plays a crucial role in chronic wound biofilms, increasing infection's morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) and chelating agent tetrasodium EDTA (T-EDTA) have been applied therapeutically owing to their multifactorial effects including bacterial killing, biofilm dispersal, and wound healing. However, previous studies assessing NO's antibiofilm efficacy have not considered the variable pH and temperature of the wound environment. Here, pH-dependent NO donors  -diazeniumdiolates (NONOates), PAPA NONOate (PA-NO) and Spermine NONOate (SP-NO), and T-EDTA were applied in wound-relevant pH environments (pH 5.5-8.5) and temperatures (32 °C and 37 °C) to   PAO1 biofilms grown for either 24 or 48 h. At 32 °C and pH 7.5, 250 μM PA-NO reduced 24-h biofilm biomass by 35 %. At 37 °C, 250 μM PA-NO and 4 % w/v T-EDTA caused 21 % and 57 % biomass reduction in 24-h biofilms, respectively. In 48-h biofilms, NONOates did not induce significant biomass reduction, while T-EDTA maintained its efficacy with a 64 % reduction. A subsequent experiment investigated the impact of NONOates and T-EDTA as pre-treatments before exposure to ciprofloxacin. Unexpectedly, NONOate pre-treatment decreased ciprofloxacin's effectiveness, resulting in approximately 1-log increase in viable planktonic and biofilm-residing cells compared to ciprofloxacin alone. It was hypothesized that this protective effect might stem from NO-induced decreased cellular respiration, which inhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated bactericidal mechanisms. These findings highlight both the potential and complexities of developing effective antimicrobial strategies for chronic wound infections, emphasizing the need for further research to optimize treatment approaches.",

  "abstract": "Primary psychodermatologic disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania, and excoriation disorder present significant challenges in dermatological and psychiatric assessment due to their complex psychological and dermatological symptoms. Reliable and valid screening tools are essential for effective diagnosis and management, yet there is a lack of consensus on the most appropriate instruments. A systematic review was conducted, identifying 81 studies that employed 45 different psychodermatologic tools, of which 13 studies provided empirical data on their diagnostic accuracy. Tools were assessed for their psychometric properties, including sensitivity, specificity, reliability, and validity. The Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire (BDDQ) and its variants demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with the BDDQ showing a sensitivity of 0.97 [95% CI: 0.82-1.00] and specificity of 0.91 [95% CI: 0.86-0.95]. The Skin Picking Scale-Revised showed high diagnostic accuracy for excoriation disorder, with a sensitivity of 0.89 [95% CI: 0.84-0.94] and specificity of 0.95 [95% CI: 0.93-0.96]. Similarly, the Massachusetts General Hospital Hairpulling Scale, frequently utilized for trichotillomania, exhibited strong psychometric properties, with a sensitivity of 0.90 [95% CI: 0.81-0.96] and specificity of 0.72 [95% CI: 0.63-0.80]. Despite their frequent use, many tools lack a comprehensive assessment of the full range of symptoms, including social impairment and behavioural nuances. The review highlights the importance of developing standardized, multidimensional assessment tools that are valid, reliable, and easy to implement in daily practice. Further research is needed to establish the practical utility of these tools in routine dermatology settings, addressing gaps in effectiveness, referral and intervention limitations, and patient acceptability.",

Stakeholders involved in their health and social care have a unique perspective on these challenges. The aim of this study was to examine how these stakeholders view the difficulties older people with chronic conditions living at home face in their everyday lives. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study based on a focus group interview with eight stakeholders involved in health care, social care and housing for older people with chronic conditions. We transcribed the interview verbatim and analysed it using thematic analysis. We generated four themes: fear of losing autonomy, inequality along socio-economic lines, persisting and new barriers, and 'what does \"remaining living at home\" really mean?'. Participants problematized the lack of awareness among key stakeholders for older people's needs and limited housing options beyond the dichotomous choice between ageing at home and in a care home. Acknowledging diverse factors - fear of losing autonomy, socio-economic situation, limited awareness of key stakeholders, physical and other barriers, societal discourses - shaping older peoples' choices regarding their living arrangements informs how occupational therapists can support them.",

In this secondary analysis of data from SPRINT-MS, a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ibudilast for progressive MS, we evaluated performance on Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Selective Reminding Test (SRT) in relation to physical disability, brain volume assessed with magnetic resonance imaging, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness over 96-week follow-up. We hypothesize that trial participants would show a decline in cognitive test scores over 96 weeks of follow-up, with a possible between-group difference in favor of ibudilast. Data from 255 participants were analyzed. On average, physical outcome measures, brain parenchymal fraction, and RNFL thickness worsened; average SDMT and SRT scores remained largely unchanged. There were no differences between treatment groups in cognitive outcomes at 96-week follow-up. Practice effects likely contributed to results. Observed stability of cognitive scores in individuals with progressive MS over 96-week follow-up may reflect true cognitive stability.

  "abstract": "Our pilot study investigated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib (TOF) in patients with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), providing a new therapeutic option. This was a historical comparator, single-center study. Patients enrolled in our study were screened using the 2016 Pediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organization (PRINTO) criteria of MAS. MAS patients deemed suitable for TOF therapy were enrolled in the experimental group. The control group included MAS patients from Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital who had received biological and/or conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/csDMARDs) treatment in a similar period. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, MAS treatment response rates, and glucocorticoid discontinuation rates were compared between the two groups before and after treatment. Serious adverse events such as thrombosis or severe infection were recorded. A total of 36 MAS patients were included-17 in the TOF treatment group and 19 in the b/csDMARDs control group. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. After six weeks, the proportion of febrile patients was significantly lower in the TOF group compared to the control group (11.8% [2/17] vs. 47.3% [9/19], P = 0.021). Significant reductions were also observed in C-reactive protein levels at week 6 (5.9% [1/17] vs. 36.8% [7/19], P = 0.026) and ferritin levels at week 12 (100.0% [17/17] vs. 26.3% [5/19], P = 0.023). The MAS treatment response rate was significantly higher in the TOF group at weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.023, respectively). Glucocorticoid discontinuation was more frequent in the TOF group, with a 12-week discontinuation rate of 100.0% (17/17) compared to 57.9% (11/19) in the control group (P = 0.002). No serious adverse events, including thrombosis or severe infections, were reported. Our results suggest that TOF may be as effective as or even better than b/csDMARDs, with a quicker and higher response rate in patients with MAS without severe adverse events. Key Points •Tofacitinib may be as effective or better than b/csDMARDs in MAS. •Tofacitinib may act at a quicker and higher response rate in MAS. •Tofacitinib might be an alternative therapeutic option for patients with MAS.",

We report the case of a 42-year-old man who developed acute-onset altered sensorium and irrelevant speech output associated with ataxia. The clinical presentation raised a suspicion of MBD, although it was not a top differential diagnosis initially. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant demyelination of the splenium of the corpus callosum, confirming the suspicion and prompting immediate intervention aimed at addressing both the neurological manifestations and the possible underlying thiamine deficiency. Relevant history of significant alcohol consumption further supported this diagnosis. Following the initiation of thiamine supplementation and supportive care, the patient exhibited gradual improvement in neurological function, eventually leading to a complete clinical recovery and resolution of radiological findings, suggestive of the type B spectrum of the disease. This report highlights the importance of clinical evaluation and neuroimaging in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic stratification of patients with MBD.",

This study evaluates the performance of FibroPredict, a novel algorithm, for detecting advanced liver fibrosis in high-risk populations. It compares its accuracy to transient elastography (TE), the current non-invasive reference standard. A retrospective cohort study of 316 high-risk individuals used electronic health record (EHR) data and routine laboratory results to calculate FibroPredict, APRI (Aspartate Aminotransferase-to-Platelet Ratio Index), and FIB-4 scores, which were then compared to liver stiffness measurements (LSM) obtained through TE. FibroPredict demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.8% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.9% at a cutoff score of ≥135 for detecting advanced fibrosis (LSM ≥8 kPa), outperforming FIB-4 in sensitivity and the ability to rule out advanced fibrosis. APRI, at a cutoff of 1.5, showed high specificity (98.41%) but low sensitivity (6.32%), making it more suitable for confirming rather than excluding advanced fibrosis. However, FibroPredict's specificity was low (21.0%), resulting in higher false-positive rates. FIB-4, with a cutoff of ≥2.67, showed lower sensitivity but better specificity (46.8%). FibroPredict's excellent sensitivity and high NPV make it a promising tool for ruling out advanced fibrosis, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, its low specificity underscores the need for confirmatory tests, such as TE, or combining it with APRI to enhance diagnostic accuracy.",

Conventional therapeutic strategies include chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit intrinsic cytotoxicity against tumor cells without the need for prior immunization or activation. In this prospective clinical trial, we evaluated the feasibility of allogeneic NK cell therapy in patients with high-risk lymphoma who had a poor prognosis. Each patient received 1 × 107 NK cells/kg infusion without interleukin-2 (IL-2) supplementation. Therapy was tolerated without graft-versus-host-disease, cytokine release syndrome, or neurotoxicity. During the follow-up period, 7 had complete responses (CR) (87.5%) and one case exhibited stable disease (SD) (12.5%). In summary, our investigations support the development of allogeneic NK cellular therapies for advanced lymphoma to overcome chemoresistance. Therapeutic efficacy may be further improved by disrupting the immunosuppressive environment and infusion of exogenous IL-15. This approach presents a promising and pragmatic strategy for managing high-risk lymphoma post-HSCT. Future research should focus on optimizing NK cell dosages and infusion frequency to maximize treatment effectiveness.",

This study presents a novel method for the automatic analysis of ultrasound images to estimate subcutaneous and visceral fat, as well as muscle, in patients with suspected malnutrition. The proposed system utilizes computer vision techniques to segment regions of interest (ROIs), calculate relevant variables, and store data for clinical evaluation. Unlike traditional segmentation methods that rely solely on thresholding or pre-defined masks, our method employs an iterative hierarchical approach to refine contour detection and improve localization accuracy. A dataset of abdominal and leg ultrasound images, captured in both longitudinal and transversal planes, was analyzed.   Results showed higher precision for longitudinal scans compared to transversal scans, particularly for length-related variables, with the Y-axis Vastus intermediate achieving a precision of 92.87%. However, area-based measurements demonstrated lower precision due to differences between manual adjustments by experts and automatic geometric approximations.   These findings highlight the system's potential for clinical use while emphasizing the need for further algorithmic refinements to improve precision in area calculations.",

  "abstract": " Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Screening can prevent CRC by detecting advanced precancerous lesions. Adherence to screening is crucial in reducing CRC disease burden; however, there is limited research on the impact of digital outreach screening uptake and adherence.   This study evaluated the impact of different digital outreach channels on patient adherence to CRC screening with a multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test in a real-world setting. Methods: Patients were individuals aged 45 to 85 years with a valid mt-sDNA test order from Exact Sciences Laboratories, LLC (Jan. 1, 2023-Sept. 23, 2023). All patients received letters and phone calls; some received short message service (SMS), email, or both. Adherence and time to test return were compared across digital outreach categories stratified by patient characteristics. Multivariable regression evaluated the association of digital outreach methods with adherence and time to test return.   Among 2 425 308 patients (43.5% between 50 and 64 years, 58.2% female), digital SMS only (62.7%) was the most common outreach method. Overall adherence was 70.1%, with highest adherence in the digital SMS-plus-email group (72.9%). Mean time to test return from shipment of mt-sDNA kit to receipt of valid test was 25.8 days. In adjusted analyses, patients receiving digital SMS plus email had the highest odds of test return (odds ratio, 1.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-1.78;  <.001) and had return times 8.7% shorter than the no-digital-outreach group (95% CI, 8.2-9.2;  <.001).   Among nationally insured individuals within the recommended age range for CRC screening, overall adherence to the mt-sDNA test was in the 70s, with the highest rates in the digital (SMS and email) outreach group and the lowest in the no-digital-outreach group.   These findings highlight the importance of multichannel navigation in facilitating completion of CRC screening with the mt-sDNA test.",

  "abstract": "To enhance influenza vaccine efficacy, it is essential to investigate new adjuvants that are both safe and effective. In a recent study utilizing a mouse model, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin polysaccharide nucleic acid (BCG-PSN) emerged as a promising candidate vaccine adjuvant. This study evaluated the immunomodulatory effects of BCG-PSN on influenza vaccines hemagglutinin antigen and aluminum adjuvant as controls. Mice were immunized with H1N1 antigen and adjuvants, and serum antibody levels were measured using hemagglutination inhibition, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and microneutralization assays. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunospot assays assessed T cell phenotypes and cytokine expression. The protective effects were tested through challenge experiments, and the adjuvants were further evaluated in a quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine. BCG-PSN adjuvant exhibited favorable safety profiles and demonstrated an ability to elevate total antibody titers, particularly enhancing neutralizing antibody production when co-administered with the H1N1 antigen. BCG-PSN increased cytokine levels and the proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes, indicating its capacity to enhance cellular immunity. Upon viral challenge in mice, BCG-PSN mitigated the production of inflammatory factors and reduced lung pathology, effectively protecting the mice. Furthermore, BCG-PSN displayed heightened immunogenicity against a mixture of four antigens. BCG-PSN is a reliable and efficient adjuvant for influenza vaccines, holding promise for enhancing vaccine efficacy and increasing immune responses.",

  "abstract": "The evoke/evoke+ trials are investigating semaglutide in a population with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific analyses of semaglutide safety data in older adults are limited; therefore, in the current analysis, we aimed to evaluate safety considerations with semaglutide in adults ≥ 65 years. Adverse event (AE) data from three semaglutide phase 3a programs in participants ≥ 65 years with type 2 diabetes and/or overweight/obesity were pooled. Change in body weight was also assessed in a smaller subset of participants ≥ 65 years. The analysis included 3529 participants ≥ 65 years. Baseline mean age and body mass index in participants ≥ 65 years were 69.3 to 70.2 years and 29.7 to 35.4 kg/m , respectively, compared to 47.8 to 58.5 years and 31.3 to 36.7 kg/m  in the overall population. AEs with semaglutide occurred in 73.6% to 92.4% of participants ≥ 65 years versus 73.2% to 90.8% of the overall population. AEs with semaglutide leading to permanent discontinuation appeared to be more frequent in participants ≥ 65 years (9.3%-12.4%) versus the overall population (5.7%-8.7%). Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequently reported AEs with semaglutide in participants ≥ 65 years (44.6%-73.8%) and in the overall population (39.1%-73.4%). Participants aged ≥ 65 years receiving semaglutide had an estimated weight loss of 3.8% at week 52 compared to 0.1% with placebo. Age ≥ 65 years did not appear to affect the safety considerations of semaglutide. The ongoing evoke/evoke+ trials will elucidate the balance of efficacy and safety in the treatment of early AD with semaglutide. This was a post hoc analysis evaluating adverse event (AE) data of semaglutide in people ≥ 65 years.The most common AE with semaglutide was gastrointestinal (GI).GI event rates were similar in people ≥ 65 years and the overall study populations.",

  "abstract": "Combination treatment with an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), and chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with HER2-negative advanced gastric/esophagogastric cancer (AGC). ICI re-administration has been reported to have a clinical benefit for patients with lung cancer or melanoma. However, data on patients with AGC have not yet been collected. We plan to conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational NIVO RETURNS study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab monotherapy re-administration in patients with AGC refractory to initial anti-PD-1 or anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody treatment. Patients who have achieved clinical benefits (complete response, partial response, or stable disease for ≥ 6 months) from prior treatment, including anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, will be included. The primary endpoint will be the objective response rate to nivolumab re-administration. We anticipate that our findings will contribute to the improvement of survival outcomes as later-line treatment for AGC.  UMIN000050515, UMIN000051044. Patients with advanced gastric or esophagogastric cancer that does not have the HER2 protein are usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy and a type of immunotherapy called an anti-PD-1 antibody. This treatment helps the immune system fight the cancer. However, even if the treatment works at first, the cancer often comes back or stops responding. In some cancers like lung cancer and melanoma, repeating immunotherapy after a break – called re-administration – has shown positive results. But for gastric cancer, there is little information about whether this strategy is helpful. We are planning a research study called the NIVO RETURNS study. It will take place at multiple hospitals and will follow patients over time without changing their treatment plans. The goal is to see if re-administering a drug called nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) is effective and safe in patients with advanced gastric cancer who were previously treated with similar drugs. We will include patients whose cancer responded well to earlier treatment (such as tumor shrinkage or disease stability for 6 months or more). The main outcome we will measure is how many patients show a positive response to nivolumab re-administration. We hope that this study will help doctors better understand whether restarting immunotherapy can be a useful option for patients with few remaining treatments. Ultimately, we aim to improve the survival and quality of life for people with advanced gastric cancer.",

  "abstract": "Patients with viral myocarditis (VMC) exhibit evident autonomic nervous system imbalance, and adverse cardiac remodeling is involved in impaired cholinergic function. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), which is a neurotransmitter receptor, exerts immunoregulatory effects. Recent advances have illuminated the evolution and functions of peripheral and cardiac B cells in heart disease. However, the role of α7nAChR expressed by B cells in the progression of VMC has not been established. We revealed the neuroimmune communication landscape in the heart and found that the phenotypes of cardiac and splenic B cells and their α7nAChR expression changed dynamically during the progression of VMC to dilated cardiomyopathy. α7nAChR on B cells serves as a negative regulator by inhibiting their proinflammatory functions and signaling pathways. B cell-specific α7nAChR deficiency exacerbated myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. However, these effects were abrogated in non-B cells from mice with IL-17A knockdown. Enhanced degradation of acetylcholine leads to an imbalance in cholinergic signaling, resulting in impaired neurotransmission. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide could improve cardiac remodeling and prevent the progression of VMC to the chronic phase, which was partly dependent on the α7nAChR on B cells. Our findings provide notable insights into cardiac-neural-immune communication during myocardial injury.",

First reported in 2013 and now identified in around 400 cases worldwide, this disease is caused by dominant, mostly de novo missense mutations in  , the gene encoding the major neuronal G protein Gαo. Being the immediate transducer of a number of neuronal G protein-coupled receptors, Gαo plays crucial functions in brain development and physiology. Here, we discover a novel mutation site in  , Cys225 mutated to Tyr or Arg in pediatric individuals from France and China (p.(Cys225Tyr) and p.(Cys225Arg), respectively), leading to severe early-onset DEE. Molecular investigations characterize the novel pathogenic variants as deficient in the interactions with guanine nucleotides and physiological cellular partners of Gαo, with reduced stability and plasma membrane localization and a strong neomorphic interaction with the chaperone Ric8A. Salts of zinc, emerging as a promising targeted therapy for  -associated disorders, impose a previously unseen effect on the mutant Gαo, accelerating the loss of its ability to interact with guanine nucleotides. Our study, combining clinical, cellular, molecular, and modeling approaches, describes deep insights into molecular etiology and treatment perspectives of the novel form of  -associated disorders.",

The aim of this review is to outline the utility of omalizumab in all types of urticarias, as well as other off-label dermatological disorders. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating the utility of omalizumab in dermatology. Databases searched included PubMed, Medline, and Embase. All original studies including case reports, case series and clinical trials were included if they were full-text, involved a dermatologic disorder treated with omalizumab and published in English. Articles were excluded if they were conference abstracts, non-clinical reports, or invitro studies. Apart from CSU, the efficacy of omalizumab has been demonstrated in atopic dermatitis (AD), bullous pemphigoid (BP), hyper IgE syndrome (HIES), mastocytosis, and Kimura's disease (KD), with the level of evidence varying for each disorder. Besides, in anecdotal reports, the benefits of omalizumab in TEN and Netherton Syndrome has been highlighted. Omalizumab offers a promising therapeutic option for a variety of dermatologic disorders beyond CSU. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols and establish definitive guidelines for omalizumab use in these conditions to facilitate quicker disease remission, improved safety, and reduced reliance on conventional immunosuppressants. However, the high cost of omalizumab remains a significant barrier for its widespread use in developing countries.",

  "abstract": "The Fontan procedure has improved the prognosis of patients with a functional single ventricle; however, late complications-including Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD)-have surfaced as clinical concerns. FALD with signs of portal hypertension has been defined as advanced FALD (aFALD) due to its poor prognosis. Recently, noninvasive tests (NITs) have been found to predict liver fibrosis in FALD. Liver stiffness measurement excluding strain elastography (SE) was affected by hepatic congestion; however, to our knowledge, not many studies have evaluated the SE-derived Liver Fibrosis Index (LFI). This study aimed to determine the efficacy of NITs, especially LFI, for discriminating aFALD. In this retrospective study, 46 Japanese patients with FALD were included and classified into the aFALD (33 patients; 22 males and 11 females; median age: 28.0 years) and non-aFALD (13 patients; seven males and six females; median age: 22.0 years) groups based on the presence/absence of signs of portal hypertension. The platelet count, FIB-4 index, Forns index, and LFI differed significantly between the two groups and demonstrated moderate accuracy for discriminating aFALD. The shear wave velocity (Vs) measured by Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) did not differ significantly between the two groups. The cut-off value of platelet counts below 185 × 10 /μL had 78.8% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity. While 25/26 (96.2%) of the patients with FALD who had platelet counts below 185 × 10 /μL were aFALD, 8/20 (40.0%) of the patients with FALD who had platelet counts above below 185 × 10 /μL were also aFALD, indicating the need for additional markers. In the patients with FALD who had platelet counts above 185 × 10 /μL, only SE indicated moderate diagnostic accuracy, and the LFI cut-off value of 2.21 had 100% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity. Using a two-step approach, discriminating aFALD with platelet counts below 185 × 10 /μL by platelets alone, and for those with higher platelet counts, requiring LFI > 2.21 could discriminate aFALD with high accuracy. Early detection of aFALD and early intervention, including testing for aFALD, may lead to an improved prognosis of aFALD.",

  "abstract": "Acute appendicitis (AA) is a leading cause of emergency abdominal surgery worldwide, with surgical intervention as its mainstay of treatment. As a primarily clinical diagnosis, it is important for physicians to have ample information to diagnose cases accurately. Given the high rates of negative appendectomies, robust diagnostic workups are crucial to minimize unnecessary surgeries and consider adjunct therapy. Various etiologies, including parasitic infections, are associated with AA. In this review, we report that   spp.,   ( ),   spp., and   ( ) contribute to or mimic AA. As globalization expands, areas once considered \"safe zones\" for parasites now face higher risks. It is therefore increasingly important for physicians in all countries to recognize the association between parasites and AA and include proper investigations for high-risk patients. Our findings aim to assist physicians on when to consider a parasitic infection and AA, potentially reducing the number of negative appendectomies, as some parasitic infections can be treated with medication alone. To our knowledge, this narrative review incorporating three databases (PubMed, Ovid and Embase), is the first to synthesize research on the relationship between parasites and AA. Articles were screened using Covidence, and inclusion criteria required references to   spp.,  ,   spp., and  . We limited results to English and French manuscripts published between 1949 and 2023. Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screening, followed by full-text analysis, ultimately selecting 71 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identifies four parasitic organisms strongly associated with AA-  spp.,  ,   spp., and  -and highlights countries where these infections are most prevalent. Furthermore, it highlights the need for more research in this area as causal relationships are still yet to be made. While strong associations exist between parasitic infections and AA, further research is needed to establish a causal relationship.",

  "abstract": "Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder marked by progressive depigmentation due to the destruction of melanocytes. Affecting 0.5-1% of the global population, vitiligo significantly impacts patients' quality of life due to its visible and psychological burden. Current treatments, such as topical agents, phototherapy, and novel immunomodulatory therapies, aim to halt depigmentation and promote repigmentation, though many patients face challenges with relapse and inadequate treatment response. A comprehensive review of literature from dermatological and immunological studies was conducted, focusing on recent advancements in topical, systemic, and physical therapies for vitiligo. Both established and emerging treatments, such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, were examined. Topical corticosteroids (TCS), calcineurin inhibitors, and novel agents like ruxolitinib have shown efficacy in managing localized vitiligo, with oral JAK inhibitors emerging as promising treatments for more extensive disease. Phototherapy, particularly narrowband UVB (NB-UVB) and excimer light devices, remains the gold standard for repigmentation, often enhanced by combining topical agents. Surgical interventions, such as melanocyte transplants, offer additional options for refractory cases, while systemic immunosuppressants and biologics require further exploration. Advances in vitiligo treatment, particularly with targeted therapies like JAK inhibitors, offer new hope for patients. However, challenges remain in achieving sustained repigmentation and preventing relapse. Future research should focus on optimizing combination therapies and exploring novel biologic agents to improve long-term outcomes.",

Remote ischaemic perconditioning (RIperC) is a neuroprotective treatment with promising preclinical results, acting through humoral and neural mechanisms. This trial aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits of prehospital-initiated RIperC in acute IS patients. REMOTE-CAT was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, sham-controlled trial across four Catalonian stroke centres. Patients over 18 years with stroke symptoms under 8 h, a pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score <3, and motor deficits (RACE motor score ≥1) were randomised 1:1 to active RIperC or sham. RIperC was applied via an automated cuff on the unaffected arm in five 5-min inflation-deflation cycles. Investigators and participants were blinded to treatment. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a favourable outcome (mRS <3) at 90 days. The intention-to-treat analysis included all patients receiving at least one inflation-deflation cycle and had a final diagnosis of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03375762). Between August 2019 and December 2023, 350 patients were screened, with 200 randomised. After 78 exclusions (29 haemorrhagic strokes, 41 stroke mimics, and 8 patients with mRS >3), 122 patients were included in the primary analysis (RIperC group, n = 57; sham group, n = 65). The RIperC group had a higher proportion of mRS <3 at 90 days (64.9%) than the sham group (47.3%), though not statistically significant in the unadjusted analysis (OR 2.03 [95% CI 0.98-4.21], p = 0.057 However, statistical significance was achieved in the post-hoc analysis adjusted for age, baseline status (determined by pre-stroke mRS score), and initial stroke severity (measured by baseline RACE score by paramedics) (OR 2.94 [95% CI 1.21-7.16], p = 0.017). No serious adverse events were observed. Despite the small sample size, our findings suggest that prehospital application of RIPerC is safe and may confer clinical benefit, as indicated in the post hoc adjusted analysis.

The aim of the present study was to investigate non-genetic association factors with ACEi-/ARB-induced angioedema in the European ADR database EudraVigilance and the database of the vARIANCE study. The cohort of the vARIANCE study comprised 114 patients who suffered from ACEi- or ARB-induced angioedema. In addition, 171 angioedema reports and 4650 reports on other ADRs of ACEi/ARB were identified in the ADR database EudraVigilance with the latter serving as a reference group. Odds ratios were calculated and a logistic regression analysis was performed using angioedema versus reference reports. Increased age, smoking, allergies and a history of previous angioedema were identified as associated factors for ACEi-/ARB-induced angioedema. In most patients, the swelling affected the face, lips and tongue. In the vARIANCE study, about 70% of angioedema occurred after 1 year of treatment. For one in two patients in the vARIANCE study (84.2% with ACEi treatment) and one in three patients from the EudraVigilance reports (59.6% with ARB treatment), the angioedema resulted in hospitalization.

  "abstract": "Increased   antibiotic resistance limits treatment options and is associated with a higher level of mortality and mordacity. The purpose of this research was to identify class 1 and 2 integrons, carbapenemase,  , and   genes in extensively drug-resistant (XDR)   isolated from infected burns and evaluate their in vitro cefiderocol activity. By using the disc diffusion method, the antimicrobial susceptibility of 110   isolates collected from infected burns were evaluated. XDR   were screened phenotypically for carbapenemase and extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) production. Both MIC Test Strip and disc diffusion were employed to test the cefiderocol susceptibility. PCR was used to assess carbapenemase,   and   genes and integrons class 1 and 2. From the 110  , 54 isolates (49%) were XDR. TEM gene was detected in 35 isolates. Among XDR isolates, carbapenemase genes were detected in 31.5%, with   being predominant Thirty XDR isolates had class1 integrons. All isolates were sensitive to cefiderocol and its MIC /MIC  was 0.5/1.5mg/L (range 0.064-1.5mg/L). Nearly half the   isolates from burn infections were extensively drug-resistant. Cefiderocol's in vitro activity demonstrated that it is a promising therapy alternative for treating extensively drug-resistant   in burn patients.",

  "abstract": "SCN2A-related disorders (RDs) are genetic conditions characterized by severe to profound impairments in multiple domains including gross motor function, which could serve as a nonseizure outcome in precision medicine therapy trials. This study evaluated specific properties of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-3 (VABS3) and other motor assessments for their fitness for use in trials of SCN2A-RDs. Sixty-five families recruited through the FamileSCN2A foundation enrolled their affected children (\"participants,\" 28 female, median age 6.4 years, interquartile range [IQR] 4.1-10.5) in a 1-year, longitudinal study. Assessments were administered at 0 (study entry), 6, and 12 months. Assessments included the VABS3, Adaptive Behavior Assessment System 0-5 years (ABAS), a modified Functional Mobility Scale (FMS), and the Functional Activities Questionnaire-Walking Level (FAQ-WL). The VABS3 composite score (34 [IQR 26-46]) indicated overall adaptive function >4 SDs below the normative mean. Forty percent of participants aged 2 years or older required wheelchairs for home distances, and 28% could not take any steps. The median standardized scores (SSs) for the VABS3 motor domain (20 [IQR 20-32]) and gross motor subdomain (1 [IQR 1-2]) reflected performance at the floor of the measures. Standardized motor scores discriminated poorly among participants with different levels of mobility (FAQ-WL and FMS) and different markers of diseases severity (presence of epilepsy, history of epileptic spasms, number of seizure medications). Cross-sectionally, SSs declined with increasing age. By contrast, raw scores of the VABS3 and ABAS and growth scale values (GSVs) of the VABS3 had relatively little floor effects. They distinguished well between participants based on FAQ-WL and FMS scores and between those with different disease severity markers. Test-retest and inter-rater reliability for all scores were excellent. No motor score changed significantly over time in the longitudinal analyses. Gross motor function in people with SCN2A-RDs is so severely impaired that it cannot be adequately measured with norm-referenced (standardized) scores. GSVs and alternative scoring assessments used out of their intended age range have superior and promising psychometric features in this severely impaired group, and they should be considered in future precision medicine trials for SCN2A-RDs and other similarly severe, rare disorders.",

  "abstract": "Teledermatology consultations offer the advantage of rapid diagnosis and care. Since 2019, our institute at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf has been part of an interdisciplinary team for teledermatology support in German prisons as an alternative to extramural transports of patients. This study aims to analyze the benefits and limitations of teledermatology for patients with limited access to medical specialties. We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional analysis of 651 teleconsultations from prisons from February 2020 to April 2023. All cases were performed in a store-and-forward (asynchronous mode) and optional hybrid live (synchronous) consultation for the patient or in-house staff. The main advantage of this case processing was the avoidance of external transport. Of the 651 teleconsultations, 608 (93.4%) could be finalized with telemedical support and 43 (6.6%) required additional workup, including verifications of the type of tumors (n=22, 51%), which needed biopsies, and open cases that were inflammatory (n=11, 26%) or involved infectious skin conditions (n=5, 12%). Digital imaging of the skin lesions improved with the experience of the personnel but remained a challenge, with the photo quality depending on the technical devices or available broadband supply. Hybrid teledermatology consultation represents an effective and resource-saving method of providing specialized care to patients in situations with limited access to medical specialties. The video consultations with experts and exchange of knowledge about the cases presented opened the opportunity to support and train intramural colleagues. One of the main challenges remains the quality of digital imaging and transmission.",

  "abstract": "The Marburg virus (MARV), discovered in 1967, has led to devastating outbreaks over the world; the mortality rate of Marburg virus disease (MVD) varies according to the outbreak and viral type. The very first known filovirus hemorrhagic fever outbreaks occurred in Germany and the former Yugoslavia. MVD is a deadly illness caused by the MARV virus, part of the Filoviridae family. It progresses with early viral replication that damages immune cells, followed by destruction of organs like the spleen, liver, and lymphoid tissues. Combatting this disease requires proper health education, and strong strategies. MVD is a lethal single-stranded RNA virus transmitted by   bats, with a fatality rate of approximately 90%. This work explored ongoing studies on the recent vaccine developments and experimental therapies, such as a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine and MVA-BN-Filo, aiming to combat this deadly infection. Over the previous years, MARV has also spread to non-endemic African countries, demonstrating its potential to cause epidemics. Although MARV-specific vaccines are evaluated in preclinical and clinical research, none have been approved for human use. Studies revealed that Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara, a well-established viral vector used to generate vaccines against emerging pathogens, can deliver multiple antigens and has a remarkable clinical safety and immunogenicity record. MVD has been recently reported in Rwanda in 2024, an African country, and nearly 15 outbreaks of MVD have been reported. This review describes the nature of the MVD, key outbreaks, the virus's pathogenesis, mode of transmission, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and control and prevention measures to advance MVD treatment, drug development, vaccine creation, and prevention of MVD.",

Yet, because ASMs can have adverse effects, guidelines suggest considering ASM withdrawal after a period of seizure freedom. We explored patients' perceived seizure risk, seizure risk tolerance, and risk counseling techniques. We interviewed adults at least one-year seizure free, seen for epilepsy across 3 academic institutions. Participants rated their own perceived seizure risks (0 \"definitely would not have another seizure\" to 10 \"definitely would\")   vs   ASMs, discussed what minimal clinically important differences would be to justify ASM continuation, rated how likely they might be to withdraw ASMs (1 \"not at all likely\" to 7 \"extremely likely\") under different hypothetical seizure risks, and recalled their previous seizure risk counseling. The median age (N = 32) was 46 years (interquartile range [IQR] 33-56), with a median of 3 years since their last seizure (IQR 2-11). Participants rated their two-year chance of another seizure   ASMs as a median 1 (IQR 0 to 2) on a \"0-10\" scale, compared with a median 5 (IQR 4 to 7)   ASMs. Participants believed that their current ASMs have a median effectiveness of 9 (IQR 7-10) on a \"0-10\" scale. Participants believed that a median effectiveness of 6 (IQR 4 to 9) on a \"0-10\" scale would warrant remaining on ASMs, although 5 participants would continue their ASM if it extended the time until next seizure by any amount no matter how small. Regarding how likely they would be to withdraw ASMs under different hypothetical seizure risks, median responses on a \"1-7\" scale were 5 (IQR 1-6) when shown two-year seizure risks of 10%   vs 11%   ASMs, 1 (1-3) if 10% vs 20%, and 1 (1-2) if 25% vs 50%. No participant recalled having been presented with numerical seizure estimates regarding possible ASM withdrawal, yet 16 (50%) would like this information particularly in our presented graphical format.

  "abstract": "Endoscopic advancements have revolutionized the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Ileocolonoscopy remains the gold standard for initial diagnosis, guiding therapeutic strategies and providing baseline disease characterization. The available literature was systematically reviewed, including articles focusing on the role of endoscopy in IBD diagnosis, disease activity assessment (endoscopic scoring), post-operative monitoring, and therapeutic interventions assessing their impact on reducing surgical intervention and optimizing disease management. Endoscopic scoring systems, including the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore, Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease, provide standardized evaluation of disease activity and treatment response. Knowledge of these scoring systems is essential in the modern era for managing the IBD. Post-operative surgical anatomy can pose a different challenge, and understanding of these is very important for a practicing gastroenterologist. In recent years, role of endoscopy has evolved from diagnosis to therapeutic interventions such as endoscopic balloon dilation, stricturotomy, and stenting to effectively manage complications like strictures and fistulas, minimizing the need for surgery. Advanced endoscopic techniques, including mucosal resection, submucosal dissection, and full-thickness resection, have transformed the management of dysplasia, reducing the risk of colectomy. This review underscores the critical role of endoscopy in optimizing patient outcomes through accurate diagnosis, therapeutic precision, and the integration of emerging technologies.",

While the role of primary immunodeficiency in immune-mediated diseases is well known, its occurrence in systemic sclerosis is not reported. This study aims to describe the clinical features associated with hypogammaglobulinemia in a cohort of limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis patients. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of systemic sclerosis patients from two Italian referral centres (2010-2024). Included patients had limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and presented reduced serum concentrations of one or more Ig isotypes (IgG < 700 mg/dL, IgA < 70 mg/dL or IgM < 50 mg/dL) in at least two separate measurements. Patients with secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia were excluded. Data collected included demographics, clinical features, Ig levels, infection history and comorbidities. We identified 30 systemic sclerosis patients (93% female, mean age 62 years) with limited cutaneous involvement and hypogammaglobulinemia. Most patients were positive for anti-centromere antibodies and received periodic intravenous infusions of prostaglandin analogues. No patient received immunosuppressive therapy. Median (interquartile range) serum IgG levels 519.5 (175) mg/dL, median IgA 65.5 (48) mg/dL and median IgM 71.5 (49) mg/dL. Four patients who met the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) criteria for common variable immunodeficiency experienced recurrent infections and had associated immune-mediated diseases. Five patients had selective IgA deficiency, with frequent immune-mediated comorbidities (thyroiditis, Sjögren's syndrome, arthritis, psoriasis). The other patients exhibited mild IgG deficiency without a significant infectious history. This is the first study describing a cohort of patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and hypogammaglobulinemia. Our population presented a high prevalence of immune-mediated comorbidities but low infection rates. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and clinical significance of hypogammaglobulinemia in these patients.",

We detail how H. pylori virulence factors, including urease, CagA, VacA, and biofilm, contribute to pathogenicity and underline the reassuring fact that naturally derived compounds sourced from plants and microorganisms have shown remarkable efficacy in inhibiting these virulence factors. Some compounds also exhibit synergistic effects with conventional antibiotics, potentially overcoming challenges associated with resistant strains.

To evaluate how age alters the prognostic impact of genetic mutations, we pooled data from 3062 pediatric and adult AML patients from multiple cohorts. Signaling pathway mutations dominated in younger patients, while mutations in epigenetic regulators, spliceosome genes, and   alterations became more frequent with increasing age. Machine learning models were trained to identify prognostic variables and predict complete remission and 2-year overall survival, achieving area-under-the-curve scores of 0.801 and 0.791, respectively. Using Shapley (SHAP) values, we quantified the contribution of each variable to model decisions and traced their impact across six age groups: infants, children, adolescents/young adults, adults, seniors, and elderly. The highest contributions to model decisions among genetic variables were found for alterations of  ,  , inv(16), and t(8;21) conferring favorable risk and alterations of  , del(5q), -7, and -17 conferring adverse risk, while  -ITD had an ambiguous role conferring favorable treatment responses yet poor overall survival. Age significantly modified the prognostic value of genetic alterations, with no single alteration consistently predicting outcomes across all age groups. Specific alterations associated with aging such as  ,  , or del(5q) posed a disproportionately higher risk in younger patients.

For example, health information and behaviors, such as HIV-related prevention and care, may disseminate within a network or across society. By harmonizing egocentric and digital networks, researchers may construct a sociocentric-like \"fuzzy\" network based on a subgroup of the population. We aimed to generate a more complete sociocentric-like \"fuzzy\" network by harmonizing alternative sources of egocentric and digital network data to examine relationships between participants in the Neighborhoods and Networks (N2) cohort study. Further, we examined network peer effects of the status-neutral HIV care continuum cascade. Data were collected from January 2018 to December 2019 in Chicago, Illinois, United States, from a community health center and via peer referral sampling as part of the N2 cohort study, comprised of Black sexually minoritized men and gender expansive populations. Participants provided sociodemographics, social networks, sexual networks, mobile phone contacts, and Facebook friends list data. Lab-based information about the HIV care continuum cascade was also collected. We used an experimental approach to develop and test a fuzzy matching algorithm to construct a more complete network across social, sexual, phone, and Facebook networks using R and Excel. We calculated social network centrality measures for each of these networks and then described the HIV care continuum within the context of each network. We then used Spearman correlation and a network autocorrelation model to examine social network peer effects with HIV status and care engagement. A total of 412 participants resulted in 2054 network connections (ties) across the confidant and sexual partner social networks (participants=387; ties=445), peer referral network (participants=412; ties=362), phone contacts (participants=273; ties=362), and Facebook network (participants=144; ties=1383), reaching the entire study sample in one fully connected \"fuzzy\" network. Results from the individual networks' autocorrelation model suggest there are no peer effects on status-neutral HIV care engagement. Results from the final fuzzy-like sociocentric network autocorrelation model, adjusted for HIV serostatus, suggest that participants who were proximate to network members engaged in HIV care were significantly more likely to be engaged in care (ρ=0.128, SE 0.064; P=.045). Using alternative sources of network data allowed us to fuzzy match a more complete network: fuzzy matching may identify hidden ties among participants that were missed by examining alternative sources of network data separately. Although sociocentric studies require significant resources to implement, more complete sociocentric-like networks may be generated using a fuzzy match approach that leverages egocentric, peer referral, and digital networks. Enriching offline networks with digital network data may provide insights into characteristics and norms that egocentric approaches may not be able to capture.",

  "abstract": "Septic arthritis of the hand often leads to sti!ness or even complete loss of joint function. Septic arthritis with osteomyelitis is especially severe. In this case, most experts recognize the need to perform arthrodesis. This study is devoted to another way of solving this problem. The results of treatment of 240 patients (255 joints) treated for septic arthritis of the hand were retrospectively analyzed. In most cases, septic arthritis with osteomyelitis was noted-145 (56.9%). All patients were operated on. After resection of osteochondral structures, in most cases, the developed method named distraction (gap) arthroplasty was used. Mid-term results were assessed within 7 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 4-9). Finger function was assessed using the total active motion (TAM) system. With the development of osteomyelitis, the delay in treatment was longer than in patients without osteomyelitis: 13 days (IQR: 4-22). Tendon destruction, which prevents the restoration of joint function, was observed in 12 (4.7%) cases. After rehabilitation, the maximum median TAM was in patients after arthritis with osteomyelitis of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint-68.1% (IQR: 50.1-86.2), 65.3% (IQR: 49.4-75.4), 60.8% (IQR: 58.7-72.4), and 63.8% (IQR: 51.7-71.9) after arthritis with osteomyelitis of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint, respectively. Septic arthritis of the hand is a severe disease that is often accompanied by the development of osteomyelitis, the spread of a purulent process to the paraarticular soft tissues, and sometimes the destruction of the tendons. It often leads to the need for arthrodesis or amputation of the finger. As an alternative to this, a treatment method named \"distraction (gap) arthroplasty\" after resection of the a!ected structures of the joint can be considered. Level IV, Therapeutic Study.",

  "abstract": "Control of endemic infectious diseases is often impeded by the lack of sensitive and specific yet easy-to-obtain biomarkers. Antibody fragment crystallizable (Fc) regions, such as Fc glycosylation, which are modulated in a pathogen-specific and disease-state-specific manner have emerged as potential such biomarkers. However current methods to perform large-scale antigen-specific antibody Fc feature screening for biomarker discovery often require too much sample volume, cost and expertise to be realistically realizable in many disease contexts. Here we present a simple, flexible and reconfigurable microfluidic device, made using rapid prototyping techniques, that can perform highly multiplexed and high-throughput biomarker discovery targeting both antibody fragment antigen-binding (Fab) and Fc features including antigen specificity, antibody isotypes, subclasses,  -glycosylation and Fc receptor binding. Using integration of an antigen microarray and reconfigurable microfluidics for sample and probe distribution, the device can perform a total of 1400 assays measuring 100 antibody Fab and Fc features per sample from a low sample volume (15 μL). The device demonstrates cleanroom-free simple fabrication and ease of use comparable to standard immunoassay platforms. Performance comparable to existing methods was validated and a biomarker screening for schistosomiasis, a helminth-mediated infection, was performed using clinical samples where antibody subclass-based biomarkers were successfully identified distinguishing current infection from former infection and endemic controls.",

  "abstract": "New York City has been the epicenter of multiple recent infectious disease outbreaks, including COVID-19 and mpox, due to its position as one of the largest international travel hubs in the United States. In response to the imperative need to transport patients to specialized biocontainment units during high-consequence infectious disease outbreaks, the Health and Human Services Region 2 Regional Emerging Special Pathogen Treatment Center at New York City Health + Hospitals/Bellevue and the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene spearheaded a comprehensive patient transport system. Informed by real-world experiences, quarterly drills, and regional partner engagement, the updated Region 2 patient transport concept of operations (CONOPS) ensures safe and seamless patient transfers. This article elucidates key components of the patient transport CONOPS, the multifaceted partner engagement approach used to develop it, and the collaborative workshop that fine-tuned the plan. Organizational skills, partner engagement, and adaptability were all necessary for refining and operationalizing a robust patient transport CONOPS. The finalization of this plan speaks to the collaborative spirit and commitment of regional leaders to ensure the effective management of high-consequence infectious disease outbreaks and the safeguarding of public health within Region 2 and beyond.",

This study aimed to elucidate the positivity rates of four autoantibodies [anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 (anti-LKM1), and anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)] in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) before and after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy compared to those in healthy controls. This study enrolled prospectively collected plasma samples from 201 CHC patients [median age, 62 years; 49.8% women; 100% sustained virological response (SVR)] from eight hospitals before and after DAA therapy and 127 healthy individuals. Autoantibodies were detected using indirect immunofluorescence. The positivity rate of ANA was higher in CHC patients than in healthy controls (32.3%   21.3%, P=0.03) at pretreatment (PreTx) and decreased at SVR (32.3%   23.9%, P=0.009). Female sex and higher globulin levels were related to ANA positivity in the control and CHC patient groups. Thirty-seven (57%) of 65 patients with ANA-positive HCV at PreTx maintained ANA-positivity at SVR. Among the 136 ANA-negative patients at PreTx, 11 (8%) showed newly positive ANA conversion at SVR. Patients with ANA positivity at SVR (n=48) were older and had a higher proportion of advanced liver disease than ANA-negative patients (n=153). ANA positivity was observed in one-third of CHC patients at PreTx, which was significantly higher than that in healthy controls and decreased after SVR. CHC patients with ANA positivity after SVR were older and had more advanced liver disease than those with ANA negativity, suggesting persistent immune dysregulation after cure.",

  "abstract": "Cervical cancer, driven by persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection, remains a global health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income areas such as western China. Despite the critical role of HPV testing in early detection, coverage in China remains low due to cultural, psychological, and other barriers. Self-collected urine and vaginal samples offer alternative methods for sample collection. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of detecting hrHPV and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) via urine and vaginal self-sampling compared with clinician sampling in urban areas of western China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 2022 to March 2023 in urban areas of western China. The participants provided self-collected urine and vaginal samples for hrHPV testing and completed questionnaires on acceptability of self-sampling. The HPV positivity, agreement, and kappa value were calculated to assess concordance between self- and clinician sampling. The sensitivity, specificity, agreement, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were used to evaluate the clinical performance of both methods for detecting CIN2+. A total of 2,228 female subjects aged 21-71 years were recruited, and self-collected urine samples, vaginal samples, and clinician-collected cervical samples were obtained. The sensitivity of clinician sampling, urine self-sampling and vaginal self-sampling were 80.00% (95% CI: 44.22-96.46), 70.00% (95% CI: 35.37-91.91) and 90.00% (95% CI: 54.12-99.48) for CIN2+; the specificity for <CIN2 were 98.33% (95% CI: 97.68-98.81), 98.23% (95% CI: 97.56-98.72) and 98.50% (95% CI: 97.87-98.95%); and the agreements for CIN2+ were 98.25% (95% CI: 97.59-98.74), 98.83 (95% CI: 98.26-99.22) and 98.82 (95% CI: 98.25-99.21). All methods yielded high negative predictive values, high positive likelihood ratios, and low negative likelihood ratios. Additionally, participants reported high acceptability of self-sampling, citing less discomfort and embarrassment than clinician sampling. Self-collected urine and vaginal samples for the detection of hrHPV and CIN2+ demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy and acceptability, making them viable alternatives to clinician-collected samples. Self-sampling methods may improve screening accessibility and compliance, especially in resource-limited settings, thereby supporting the prevention and early detection of CIN2+.",

We propose a new method for modeling CHD risk by considering the influencing factors, namely age, fatty food consumption and anxiety using Penalized Spline Nonparametric Logistic Regression (PSNLR) approach to analyze the CHD and non-CHD risks affected by these influencing factors. The proposed method gave results a percentage of model classification accuracy of 94.31 % and the value of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96. This means that the proposed method is a powerful method in modeling the CHD risk and it can effectively identify the nonlinear relationship between influencing factors and CHD incidence. This research supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) point 3, especially the target of reducing deaths from non-communicable diseases such as CHD through improving disease prevention and treatment. The use of more accurate models in identifying risk factors also contributes to efforts to improve overall public health and strengthen health care systems.•A cross-sectional survey on influencing factors of CHD risk was conducted at the Airlangga University Hospital.•For analyzing relationship between influencing factors and CHD risk, we used PSNLR method.",

  "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) encompass five major categories: cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, mental health disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases. The burden of NCDs is rising in Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, having increased by 67% from 1990 to 2017, which puts additional pressure on healthcare services. Although most treatments for NCDs are non-surgical, surgical intervention plays a crucial role in managing many of these diseases. Unfortunately, barriers to accessing surgical care for NCDs remain in Africa. A comprehensive literature review was conducted employing the following search databases: AJOL, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar. Search strategies that combined terms pertaining to \"non-communicable disease,\" \"surgical care,\" and \"Africa\" were utilized. The main barriers to surgical access in the management of NCDs in Africa include restricted financial resources, a lack of adequate infrastructure, and deficiencies in competent surgical training. Measures to improve surgical intervention associated with NCDs include international collaborations, improved education and training of professionals, and the use of mobile technology tools. There is a need to implement strategies that seek to improve access to surgery for the treatment of NCDs on the African continent. Some of these strategies involve multi-professional action alongside the establishment of prevention actions and policies aimed at the management of NCDs. Furthermore, support from the governments of each nation, as well as ongoing research on the subject, also contribute to better development of surgical care for these diseases in the African context.",

However, while RB1 mosaicism has been reported in retinoblastoma, its clinical implications and potential impact on cfDNA testing remain unclear. To identify RB1 mosaicism using paired plasma and buffy coat (containing lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and platelets) DNA testing, and to characterize the implications of RB1 mosaicism on cfDNA testing outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, participants with retinoblastoma underwent testing with MSK-ACCESS (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Analysis of Circulating cfDNA to Examine Somatic Status), a clinical assay that combines plasma cfDNA and buffy coat genomic DNA sequencing, enabling the detection and differentiation of somatic, heterozygous, and mosaic variants, between July 2020 and April 2024 at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Mosaic findings from MSK-ACCESS were correlated with those from a subgroup of patients who concurrently underwent testing using the MSK-IMPACT germline assay. Data analysis was performed from April to September 2024. RB1 mosaicism in retinoblastoma. The RB1 variant allele fractions in cfDNA and buffy coat genomic DNA were used to detect RB1 mosaicism. A total of 136 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma (median age at diagnosis, 1.0 year [IQR, 0.4-1.7 years]; 74 [54.4%] female; 67 with bilateral disease and 69 with unilateral disease) who underwent testing with the MSK-ACCESS assay were included. RB1 mosaicism was identified in buffy coat DNA from 20 patients (14.7%), with consistent results detected in all 11 participants tested concurrently by the MSK-IMPACT (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets) germline assay. Four participants with RB1 mosaicism previously tested negative for germline RB1 variants by external laboratories. Compared with heterozygous participants, participants with RB1 mosaicism had a lower risk of developing bilateral disease (91.7% vs 55.0%, respectively; difference, 36.7% [95% CI, 13.8%-59.6%]; P = .002). In cfDNA, the mosaicism variant was detected both before and after treatment, with variant allele fraction initially decreasing after treatment but then stabilizing at levels consistent with mosaicism, despite the absence of clinical disease. The accurate detection and quantification of RB1 mosaicism are crucial. RB1 mosaicism should be considered when RB1 variants persist in cfDNA after treatment without evidence of disease; failure to do so may lead to false-positive results and overtreatment in patients with RB1 mosaicism. Identifying RB1 mosaicism may improve patient counseling, inform treatment decisions, and enhance surveillance efforts.",

Furthermore, optimal therapy is uncertain due to lack of direct comparison of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and docetaxel in high-volume disease. To evaluate the use of combination therapy and its association with overall survival among patients with mHSPC and to compare ARPIs vs docetaxel doublet therapy by volume of disease. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the US Veterans Health Administration among 6216 US veterans with de novo mHSPC from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022, treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months of diagnosis. Treatments for mHSPC were collected within 4 months of ADT. Volume of disease was assessed from radiology report review. Data were analyzed from July 2023 to October 2024. Overall survival (OS) and clinical progression-free survival (PFS), indicated by time to castration resistance or death. Among 6216 male veterans with mHSPC (mean [SD] age, 73.9 [9.7] years), use of combination therapy increased from 344 of 637 veterans (54.0%) in 2020 to 465 of 737 veterans (63.1%) in 2022.

Refining clinical stage groups, especially in the overabundant cN1/stage I group, has become important for treatment selection. To assess the prognostic importance of pretreatment lymph node (LN) characteristics to optimize case distribution and outcome homogeneity within the N classification system. This is an international multi-institutional retrospective prognostic cohort study. Analysis of human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma treated curatively from 4 institutions (International Collaboration of Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for N-Classification [ICON-N] dataset) provided a refined clinical staging proposal; an independent dataset (Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal [CHUM] dataset) validated the proposal. Neuroradiologists reviewed pretreatment computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for nodal features, including presence or absence of abnormal LN(s), retropharyngeal LN, laterality, number of abnormal LN, and imaging-detected extranodal extension (iENE). Data were collected from February to May 2023, and data were analyzed from June to July 2023. Definitive chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy or definitive surgery with or without postoperative chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. The primary end point was overall survival. A Cox proportional hazards multivariable model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) and to derive an optimal clinical TNM stage classification (AHR-stage schema) incorporating the strongest prognostic nodal features within the UICC/AJCC eighth edition TNM framework after confirming the prognostication of iENE status. The performance (according to overall normalized scores and ranking) of the AHR-stage schema against the current UICC/AJCC eighth edition TNM staging system was evaluated for hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, prognostic importance, and sample size balance. Validation was performed in the CHUM dataset. The ICON-N dataset comprised 2053 patients, including 1898 (92.5%) with cN-positive disease and 155 (7.5%) with cN0 disease; a total of 298 (14.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 60.6 (9.3) years. iENE-positive disease was identified in 710 of 1898 patients with cN-positive disease (37.4%). The median (range) follow-up was 5.1 (0.1-14.7) years. iENE was the strongest prognostic nodal feature in multivariable analysis; the AHR for iENE-positive vs iENE-positive disease was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.96-3.03) in the ICON-N dataset and 2.04 (95% CI, 1.28-3.23) in the CHUM dataset (n = 451). Reclassifying iENE-positive cases 1 stratum higher for N categorization without altering iENE-negative cases yielded an AHR-stage schema that outperformed the current TNM staging system in disease-free and overall survival with a lower (ie, better) overall normalized score (2 vs 3). In this study, reclassifying each N category 1 stratum higher for iENE-positive disease resulted in better disease-free and overall survival. The proposed new classification outperformed the currently TNM staging system in risk stratification and may facilitate future clinical trial design, outcomes research, and patient care.",

To evaluate this serious complication, we used \"Quick Dash\" or \"FACT-B\", which can assess a patient's physical, social, emotional, and functional health status. To evaluate their breast cancer surgery-related dysfunction correctly, \"FACT-B + 4\" was created by adding four questions about \"arm swelling'' and \"tenderness\". We have translated it into Japanese according to international translation guidelines. At the beginning, we contacted FACT headquarters that we would like to create a Japanese version of FACT-B + 4. They formed the FACIT Trans Team (FACIT) following international translation procedures, and then, we began translating according to them. The steps are 1: perform \"Forward and Reverse translations\" to create a \"Preliminary Japanese version\", 2: request the cooperation of 5 breast cancer patients and \"conduct a pilot study\" and \"questionnaire survey\", and 3: amendments and final approval based on pilot study results and clinical perspectives. In Step1, FACIT requested faithful translation of the words, verbs, and nouns from the original text. In Step2, patients reported that they felt uncomfortable with the Japanese version words such as \"numb'' and \"stiffness'' and felt that it might be difficult to describe their symptoms accurately. In Step3, we readjusted the translation to be more concise and closer to common Japanese language, and performed \"Step1\" again to ensure that the translation definitely retained the meaning of the original. A Japanese version of FACT has existed until now, but there was no Japanese version of FACT-B + 4, which adds four additional items to evaluate swelling and pain in the upper limbs.

  "abstract": "The therapeutic landscape for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) continues to evolve, raising critical questions about the optimal integration of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to improve patient outcomes. Historically, WBRT has been a cornerstone in PCNSL management, offering effective disease control and relapse prevention. However, the use of high-dose WBRT (HD-WBRT) (≥ 36 Gy), while efficacious, has been associated with significant neurotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients, which has curtailed its long-term applicability. In recent years, high-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) has emerged as a consolidative treatment option, demonstrating efficacy comparable to WBRT, especially in younger patients and those with better performance status, thereby reshaping the therapeutic paradigm. As the therapeutic paradigm shifts, efforts to explore advances in WBRT techniques, such as dose reduction (23.4 Gy) and hyperfractionated protocols, have been aimed at mitigating neurotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. These innovations make WBRT a viable option for carefully selected patient populations. Furthermore, this review explores emerging strategies, including localized radiotherapy, novel therapeutic combinations, and individualized treatment paradigms, while identifying key directions for future research to optimize outcomes for PCNSL patients.",

  "abstract": "The combination of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with immune checkpoint inhibitors, known as iSABR, marks a significant evolution in treating early-stage, inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Managing these cases requires a multidisciplinary approach involving radiation and medical oncologists. Clinical evidence from a meta-analysis of seven studies, including 462 patients, indicates that iSABR may offer better outcomes than SABR alone. The analysis showed significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-ups for iSABR compared to SABR. There was also a trend toward better overall survival (OS) with iSABR. Subgroup analyses highlighted enhanced 3-year PFS with programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors and doses per fraction ≥ 12.5 Gy. While iSABR slightly increased the risk of grade ≥ 3 adverse events like pneumonitis, fatigue, and skin reactions, these risks are generally manageable within a multidisciplinary treatment framework. In conclusion, iSABR demonstrates potential benefits and manageable risks in phase I/II trials for early-stage, inoperable NSCLC, with improved PFS and acceptable toxicity. These findings warrant further investigation in a larger phase III prospective randomized controlled trial to validate efficacy, optimize protocols, and establish long-term safety.",

  "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is hematological cancer characterized by the aberrant proliferation of plasma cells. The treatment of MM has historically presented challenges, with a limited number of patients achieving sustained remission. Recent advancements in the therapeutic landscape have been marked by the development of B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted therapies. BCMA, a plasma cell surface protein, is instrumental in the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells. This review aims to critically assess recent developments in BCMA-targeted therapies. The focus is on evaluating their efficacy and accessibility, as well as discussing potential future directions in this field. Emphasis is placed on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies as emerging therapeutic strategies. An extensive review of current clinical trials and studies was conducted, centering on BCMA-targeted therapies. This encompassed an analysis of CAR T-cell therapies, which involve the genetic modification of patient T-cells to target BCMA, and bispecific antibodies that bind to both BCMA on myeloma cells and CD3 on T-cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of BCMA-targeted therapies in MM, with some patients achieving complete remission. However, these therapies are associated with adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. Research efforts are ongoing to reduce these side effects and enhance overall therapeutic effectiveness. BCMA-targeted therapies signify a notable advancement in MM treatment, offering prospects for prolonged remission and potentially curative outcomes. Despite existing challenges, these therapies represent a significant shift in MM management. The review highlights the necessity of ongoing research to optimize these therapies, improve patient outcomes, and increase treatment accessibility.",

  "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for brain homeostasis but is a major obstacle in delivering anticancer drugs to brain tumors. However, this perspective requires re-evaluation, particularly for malignant brain tumors, such as gliomas and brain metastases. In these aggressive tumors, the BBB undergoes significant alterations, leading to the formation of a more permeable blood-tumor barrier. While this increased permeability allows better drug penetration, heterogeneity in blood-tumor barrier (BTB) integrity across different tumor regions remains a challenge. Additionally, the main challenge in treating brain tumors lies not in BBB penetration but in the lack of effective drugs. Conventional chemotherapies, including temozolomide and nitrosourea agents, have shown limited efficacy, and resistance mechanisms often reduce their long-term benefits. The \"BBB curse\" has often been blamed for the slow progress in drug development. However, emerging evidence suggests that even larger-molecule therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, can successfully target brain tumors. This review aims to critically reassess the roles of the BBB and BTB in brain tumor therapy, highlighting their impact on drug delivery and evaluating the current landscape of chemotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it explores new approaches to overcome treatment limitations, emphasizing the need for personalized and targeted therapeutic strategies.",

The majority of alterations identified in these regions remain unclassified, but evidence of the impact of variants in the regulatory regions on cancer risk and response to treatment is emerging. This project aimed to investigate the prevalence of germline variants in the non-coding regulatory regions of BRCA1/2 and other BC predisposition genes in patients with triple-negative BC (TNBC) selected for age at cancer diagnosis and/or family history of cancer. The study also aims to investigate the relationship between these variants and clinical outcomes such as overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and response to treatment. We analyzed a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) custom panel of promoter regions of 28 genes involved in BC predisposition on 144 patients with TNBC previously tested wild type for coding regions of BRCA1/2. The NGS analysis identified 635 rare variants in promoter regions of the 28 genes. Among the 144 patients, for 75 with available clinical data, rare germline variants in BRCA2 promoter were statistically significantly related to worse overall survival (OS) (P-value = .017). No differences in DFS and OS were found for the other genes. Rare variants in the CDH1 promoter were related to the highest percentage of non-pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P = .0273); MLH1 and PALB2 rare non-coding variants were found to be both related to bilateral BC (P = .0146 and P = .0005, respectively) and ATM promoter variants were associated with a positive family history (P = .041). Our results underscore the importance of searching for rare germline variants in regulatory regions of cancer predisposition genes in patients with TNBC, since these variants can be associated with an increased cancer risk.",

No significant differences were observed for the other secondary outcomes. The LE group showed higher biochemical pregnancy and live birth rates in the normal weight and normal androgen subgroups. Pregnancy outcomes were similar in the overweight and hyperandrogenic subgroups. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical pregnancy rates between the LE and HRT cycles for FET in women with PCOS. However, the LE protocol may be a preferable option to HRT for women with normal weight or normal androgen levels.

  "abstract": "Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a primary palliative treatment for advanced liver cancer. Nonetheless, its therapeutic efficacy is frequently hindered by resistance to tumor cell apoptosis induced by inter-radiotherapy. Induction of multiple cell death modalities provides a potential solution to this challenge. Ferroptosis, a distinct form of cell death from apoptosis, is dependent on the intracellular Fe -mediated Fenton reaction for the production of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and is gaining recognition as a promising approach for cancer treatment. In this study, we synthesized a therapeutic radionuclide iodine-131 ( I)-based TARE agent by combining  I-labeled iron-based MIL-88B(Fe) nanoparticles (NPs) (abbreviated as  I-MIL-88B(Fe)) with Lipiodol to achieve a combined apoptosis-ferroptosis tumor therapy. Specifically, a mixture of Lipiodol and  I-MIL-88B(Fe) NPs was injected into the liver tumors through the hepatic artery. Lipiodol blocks the arterial blood supply of the tumor, causing tumor tissue necrosis, whereas  I inter-radiotherapy damages deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) through direct action or indirectly via the production of ·OH through H O radiolysis, leading to tumor cell apoptosis. Importantly, hydrated electrons (e ), a byproduct of H O radiolysis, promoted the conversion of Fe  to Fe  in MIL-88B(Fe) NPs, enhancing the efficacy of the Fenton reaction and triggering ferroptosis.   experiments demonstrated that compared to  I alone,  I-MIL-88B(Fe) NPs significantly enhanced ferroptosis-mediated tumor cell death due to  I-induced Fe  production, which increased catalytic activity in the Fenton reaction. In a rat model bearing orthotopic N1S1 liver tumors, TARE with Lipiodol and  I-MIL-88B(Fe) NPs induced tumor cell necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes. This study leverages e  to facilitate Fe /Fe  conversion for efficient ferroptosis, turning waste into a valuable resource. This demonstrated the innovative integration of multiple treatment strategies to augment the efficacy of TARE in liver cancer therapy.",

Anti-TNF injection has undergone phase 2 trials and may be effective in slowing early-stage disease progression. Here we sought to determine how new synthesis of type I collagen in Dupuytren's differs from normal palmar fascia samples and to analyze the role of TNF in aberrant collagen synthesis. Model nonfibrotic but fibrous connective tissues were used to analyze active type I collagen protein synthesis in development, aging, and degenerative disease, where it was restricted to early development and ruptured tissue. Dupuytren's tissue was shown to actively synthesize type I collagen, including abnormal type I collagen homotrimer. TNF-α reduced COL1A2 gene expression only in the presence of serum in 2D cell culture and had opposing effects on collagen protein production in the presence or absence of serum. TNF-α had only limited effects in 3D tendon-like constructs. Anti-TNF did not reduce type I collagen synthesis in 3D tendon-like constructs or prevent type I collagen homotrimer synthesis in Dupuytren's tissue. Hence, modulation of the TNF-α pathway in Dupuytren's disease is unlikely to prevent the pathological collagen accumulation that is characteristic of fibrosis.",

Needle biopsy specimens obtained before relugolix administration showed no malignancy, and significant tumor shrinkage was observed following treatment. Both patients subsequently underwent myomectomy. One patient achieved a live birth 14 months after myomectomy, whereas the other experienced improvement in severe anemia, allowing her to prepare for pregnancy. Histological examination after relugolix administration revealed atrophic changes in spindle cells within the fibroids, characterized by nuclear crowding and decreased immunoreactivity for desmin and α-smooth muscle actin. The significant fibroid shrinkage observed after the short-term administration of relugolix provided a rationale for myomectomy, improved anemia, and facilitated appropriate uterine reconstruction, ensuring structural integrity for future pregnancies in women of reproductive age.",

Of 16 patients screened, 9 were included in this study, with 6 evaluable corneal samples obtained from 6 patients either by IC (n = 4) or SK (n = 2). Of 9 patients included, median (range) patient age was 67.0 (57.0-81.0) years for those with samples obtained by IC and 68.0 (65.0-81.0) years for those with samples obtained by SK. Six patients (67%) were female. All samples demonstrated epithelial cells with eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions, basophilic granular cytoplasm, or both. Five samples were positive for apoptosis, and 3 samples showed evidence of inflammation. All patients experienced complete IC or SK wound healing. ADC was detected in the tear fluid of 5 of 7 patients with tear fluid sampling, while ADC was quantifiable in 3 of 4 patients with blood samples. In this case series study, intracytoplasmic inclusions were observed by histopathology in the corneal epithelium of patients exposed to belantamab mafodotin, and the pattern of corneal changes suggests limbal vessels may be a primary pathway enabling ADC to reach the cornea. Although limited to 6 samples, this study helps us better understand corneal changes associated with certain ADCs. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04549363.",

  "abstract": "Primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration plays an important role in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the benefits of such collaboration in patients with stage 5 CKD remain unclear. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD across nine nephrology centers in Japan. The exposure of interest was primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration. We examined the association between primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration and clinical outcomes in adult outpatients with stage 5 CKD: dialysis initiation and cause-specific hospitalizations using the Fine-Gray models, which treat death and preemptive kidney transplantation and death and kidney replacement therapy as competing risk events, respectively. Of the 570 patients included in the analysis, 91 (16.0%) received primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration, whereas the remaining patients were treated by nephrologists alone. During a median follow-up of 1.4 years, 399 (70.0%) patients started dialysis, 11 (1.9%) received preemptive kidney transplantation, and 53 (9.3%) died. There were no significant between-group differences in dialysis initiation and CKD- and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] [95% confidence interval], 0.89 [0.64-1.23], 1.22 [0.78-1.90], and 0.95 [0.46-1.98], respectively). However, primary care physician-nephrologist collaboration was associated with a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization (adjusted SHR [95% confidence interval], 0.36 [0.15-0.87]).

  "abstract": "Patients with viral myocarditis (VMC) exhibit evident autonomic nervous system imbalance, and adverse cardiac remodeling is involved in impaired cholinergic function. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR), which is a neurotransmitter receptor, exerts immunoregulatory effects. Recent advances have illuminated the evolution and functions of peripheral and cardiac B cells in heart disease. However, the role of α7nAChR expressed by B cells in the progression of VMC has not been established. We revealed the neuroimmune communication landscape in the heart and found that the phenotypes of cardiac and splenic B cells and their α7nAChR expression changed dynamically during the progression of VMC to dilated cardiomyopathy. α7nAChR on B cells serves as a negative regulator by inhibiting their proinflammatory functions and signaling pathways. B cell-specific α7nAChR deficiency exacerbated myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. However, these effects were abrogated in non-B cells from mice with IL-17A knockdown. Enhanced degradation of acetylcholine leads to an imbalance in cholinergic signaling, resulting in impaired neurotransmission. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide could improve cardiac remodeling and prevent the progression of VMC to the chronic phase, which was partly dependent on the α7nAChR on B cells. Our findings provide notable insights into cardiac-neural-immune communication during myocardial injury.",

Male sex, older age, higher income, urban residence, non-smoking, and higher physical activity were associated with good medication adherence. Initial combination therapy, especially with single-pill combination (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.18), was associated with good adherence. Among patients under monotherapy, initial use of renin-angiotensin blockers (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 4.47-6.15) or calcium-channel blockers (OR, 4.07; 95% CI, 3.47-4.78) was associated with better adherence than initial diuretics. Although antihypertensive medication adherence is generally poor among young adults, we identified potential demographic and clinical factors associated with good adherence to antihypertensive treatment. Initial use of a single-pill combination may promote adherence in young patients, and its long-term clinical outcomes warrant further investigation.",

  "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to examine how intermediate-risk factors affect the oncological outcomes of patients diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018 stage IB2 cervical cancer who do not undergo any adjuvant treatment. A multicentric retrospective study that involved 612 patients who were diagnosed with stage IA-IB2 cervical cancer at seven tertiary gynaecological oncology centres between 1993 and 2023 was conducted. A total of 232 patients were classified as FIGO 2018 stage IB2. Patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, parametrial or surgical border involvement, received adjuvant therapy and synchronous tumours were excluded from the present cohort. Therefore, the present study cohort consisted of 120 patients who had undergone radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. Among the 120 patients, 89 (74.2%) had squamous cell cancer, 18 (15%) had adenocarcinoma, 2 (1.7%) had a mixed type tumour consisting of squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma and 11 (9.1%) had other types of tumours (adenosquamous cancer and glassy cell cancer). Deep cervical stromal invasion was found in 68 (56.7%) patients. The duration of patient follow-up varied from 1 to 246 months, with a median of 36 months. Overall, 6 patients (5%) experienced recurrence and 1 patient (0.8%) succumbed to the disease. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 94%, whereas the 3-year overall survival rate was 99%. The presence of deep cervical stromal invasion had a statistically significant impact on DFS (P=0.038). Deep cervical stromal invasion was found to be associated with recurrence in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer. Hence, the present study demonstrated that the presence of deep cervical stromal invasion may be considered a key parameter in determining whether adjuvant treatment should be applied in patients with stage IB2 cervical cancer.",

  "abstract": "Combination therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) has been widely adopted, yet clinical use and outcomes are unknown. Furthermore, optimal therapy is uncertain due to lack of direct comparison of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and docetaxel in high-volume disease. To evaluate the use of combination therapy and its association with overall survival among patients with mHSPC and to compare ARPIs vs docetaxel doublet therapy by volume of disease. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the US Veterans Health Administration among 6216 US veterans with de novo mHSPC from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2022, treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months of diagnosis. Treatments for mHSPC were collected within 4 months of ADT. Volume of disease was assessed from radiology report review. Data were analyzed from July 2023 to October 2024. Overall survival (OS) and clinical progression-free survival (PFS), indicated by time to castration resistance or death. Among 6216 male veterans with mHSPC (mean [SD] age, 73.9 [9.7] years), use of combination therapy increased from 344 of 637 veterans (54.0%) in 2020 to 465 of 737 veterans (63.1%) in 2022. Among 4106 veterans treated from 2017 to 2022, combination therapy was associated with longer OS (40.3 [95% CI, 38.0-42.1] months vs 33.0 [95% CI, 31.2-35.1] months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.74-0.87]) and was used more frequently among younger veterans with fewer comorbidities. Among 1174 veterans with high-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (32.3 [95% CI, 29.5-35.3] months vs 34.7 [95% CI, 31.7-37.1] months; HR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.91-1.23]); however, ARPIs were associated with longer PFS (18.7 [95% CI, 17.1-20.9] months vs 16.0 [95% CI, 14.0-17.7] months; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.70-0.91]; P = .001). In a multivariable model of high-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (adjusted HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.76-1.05]). Among 366 veterans with low-volume mHSPC, there was no difference in OS between ARPIs and docetaxel (68.4 [95% CI, 52.6 months to not reached] months vs 55.3 [95% CI, 41.7-78.9] months; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.58-1.13]), but ARPIs were associated with longer PFS (39.7 [95% CI, 34.3-52.9] months vs 24.0 [95% CI, 20.3-32.9] months; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.43-0.76]). In this cross-sectional study of veterans with de novo mHSPC, use of combination therapies increased over time and were associated with longer survival compared with ADT monotherapy. In both high- and low-volume mHSPC, no differences in OS were observed between ARPI and docetaxel combinations; however, ARPIs had longer PFS. Future research into the role of docetaxel is needed to elucidate the benefit of chemotherapy in mHSPC.",

Genetic IL (interleukin)-6 signaling deficiency reduced cardiovascular disease risk in CHIP carriers. However, the association between CHIP and incident abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and whether IL-6 signaling inhibition attenuates AAA risk among individuals with CHIP remained unclear. Participants without prevalent AAA from the UK Biobank were included. The associations of any CHIP (variant allele fraction, ≥2%), large CHIP (variant allele fraction, ≥10%), and gene-specific CHIP subtypes with incident AAA were investigated. The protection role of   p.Asp358Ala, a genetic proxy for IL-6 deficiency, was tested after stratification by CHIP status. Furthermore, the interaction and joint effects of CHIP and genetic susceptibility on AAA risk were tested. This study included 425 211 participants.

  "abstract": "Background Minimally invasive hysterectomy approaches, including vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic hysterectomy, offer advantages over laparotomic hysterectomy. However, vaginal hysterectomy is less feasible for patients with a large uterus, prior pelvic surgery, adnexal surgery requirements, or malignancy, making laparoscopy or robotic surgery preferable. The SSI Mantra robotic system (Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt. Ltd., India) features an ergonomic open-faced console with a 32-inch 3D 4K monitor, a 23-inch 2D touch monitor for system control and DICOM applications, a head-tracking safety feature, and advanced ergonomic controls. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of robotic hysterectomy using this indigenous system. Materials and methods From February to September 2024, 15 patients underwent robotic hysterectomy at Government Medical College, Nagpur. Patients were counseled about using the SSI Mantra robotic system and surgical risks, including possible conversion to laparotomy or robotic arm injury. The procedure followed a standard robotic port approach with accessory laparoscopic ports. Multiple surgeons performed the surgeries. The primary outcome was operative time, defined from incision start to closure. Additional data collected included patient intubation time, draping time, port placement, docking time, console time, surgical end time, patient out time, and estimated blood loss (fluid volume difference between irrigation and suction). Perioperative complications, readmissions, surgeon experience impact on operative time, conversion to laparotomy, hospital stay duration, hemoglobin drop, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores, and intraoperative strategies (e.g., adhesiolysis, myomectomy) were analyzed. The weight of the excised uterus was also recorded. Results All 15 cases were successfully completed. The mean body mass index was 22.36 kg/m² (range: 19-25). The mean operative time (console use) was 169.41 minutes. Docking time improved from 25 minutes in the first case to five minutes by the 12th. The mean hospital stay was 4.5 days. The average uterine weight was 104.58 g (range: 25-250 g). Estimated blood loss averaged 129.16 mL (range: 30-400 mL). Vaginal cuff closure time was recorded in one case (20 minutes). The mean VAS pain score was 3.91. A hemoglobin drop occurred in four cases, but no postoperative blood transfusions were required. There were no conversions, major complications, or readmissions. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the indigenous robotic system provides enhanced ergonomics, seven degrees of freedom, ease of operation, and improved safety with a shorter learning curve for large uteri. Further studies are needed to assess postoperative and long-term outcomes.",

  "abstract": "In this cross-sectional study in Zambia, we examined factors that influence cognitive performance in adults with clade C human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) infection who were on antiretroviral therapy. We examined if detectable HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in blood plasma, nadir CD4+ T-cell count before antiretroviral therapy, increase in CD4+ T-cell count during antiretroviral therapy, and having pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) influenced cognitive performance. We performed a multilinear regression in which the dependent variable was the global mean cognitive  -score, an overall composite score based on 16 neuropsychological tests that were adjusted for age, sex, and education using normative data from Zambian adults without HIV infection. The 16 tests were merged into seven cognitive domains: Executive Functions, Verbal Fluency, Attention/Working Memory, Learning (immediate recall), Memory (delayed recall), Motor Control, and Speed of Information Processing. When on antiretroviral therapy, a greater increase in CD4+ T-cells was significantly associated with a better global mean cognitive  -score (  = .002). Pulmonary TB was independently associated with worse performance (  = .008). Neither nadir CD4+ T-cell count nor plasma HIV RNA during antiretroviral therapy was associated with cognitive performance. Accounting for CD4+ T-cell increase after antiretroviral therapy initiation and comorbid pulmonary TB may help explain cognitive outcomes in persons with HIV infection in endemic settings. We suggest that it is essential that those with a low CD4+ T-cell count increase the number of cells as early as possible. Our data suggest that this is important for their cognitive functioning. Future research should determine whether the deleterious effect of pulmonary TB resolves after completion of TB treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved).",

  "abstract": "Background and objectives Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its management can adversely affect patients' quality of life and mental health. Many patients are often inadequately informed about their condition and the available treatment options. A considerable number of people with advanced kidney disease have insufficient knowledge about their condition and the available treatment options. This study aims to investigate the impact of an educational intervention on quality of life, psychological resilience, anxiety, and depression. This study specifically aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on variables such as quality of life, psychological resilience, anxiety, and depression. Methods A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients with CKD stage 4-5 to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention in improving the aforementioned parameters. Furthermore, the correlation between these outcomes and the level of satisfaction with the intervention was analyzed. Participants were randomized (3:1) into two groups: an educational intervention group (33 patients) and a control group (12 patients). In the intervention group, we performed educational presentations accompanied by a relevant video. Participants completed the questionnaires both before and after the intervention. Participants in the control group were only asked to complete the questionnaires again after the same time period as the intervention group. Results Higher satisfaction with the intervention was significantly associated with a reduction in anxiety (r = -0.38, p = 0.03) and depression scores (r = -0.44, p = 0.01), along with a notable improvement in social functioning (r = 0.40, p = 0.02). Furthermore, a marginally significant positive correlation was observed between the satisfaction scale and psychological resilience (r = 0.32, p = 0.07). Conclusion The level of satisfaction with the intervention is a critical factor in determining its effectiveness. Tailoring the intervention to address the unique needs of each patient may significantly enhance its impact.",

  "abstract": " Distress, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, is associated with lower cognitive function and higher use of medications, including sleep aids, opiate pain relievers, and minor tranquilizers. Whether use of these medications is linked to lower cognitive function, and whether such medication use might partially explain the relationship between distress and cognition remains unclear. Using data from 10,653 women in the Nurses' Health Study II, we assessed associations between distress and past-month medication use; medication use and cognitive function; and whether medication use mediates the distress-cognitive function relationship.   Distress was defined using validated measures of PTSD and depression. To consider possible joint effects of experiencing both forms of distress, we derived a continuous, standardized distress score including symptoms of both PTSD and depression, and a six-level categorical variable indicating the presence/absence of trauma, PTSD, and depression. Past-month medication use was self-reported. Cognitive function was measured with the Cogstate Brief Battery, yielding composite score measures of psychomotor speed/attention and learning/working memory. We fit linear regression models for continuous outcomes, logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes, and conducted causal mediation analysis using a counterfactual framework.   Higher distress was associated with use of all three medications (e.g., a 1-standard-deviation higher continuous distress score was associated with 1.5 times the adjusted odds of past-month opiate use [95% confidence interval: 1.40, 1.60]). Associations between past-month medication use and cognitive function were mixed.   We did not find clear evidence of mediation by medication use, suggesting that distress may influence cognitive function   other pathways.",

Isolated genital TB is uncommon, making diagnosis challenging and requiring careful evaluation to differentiate it from tumors, especially in low-resource settings. A 20-year-old nulliparous Ethiopian woman presented with a history of long-standing abdominal swelling and constitutional symptoms, including fever and significant ascites. Investigations revealed bilateral adnexal masses and lymphocyte-predominant ascitic fluid, negative for malignant cells. Initially, advanced ovarian tumor was the primary differential diagnosis, leading to consideration for exploratory laparotomy. However, due to the patient's unfitness for surgery, tubo-ovarian tuberculosis was considered following further evaluation. The patient demonstrated improvement after initiating anti-tuberculosis therapy. TB remains a major global health issue. Genitourinary TB is a common extrapulmonary manifestation, but isolated genital TB is challenging to diagnose due to non-specific symptoms mimicking ovarian tumors. Diagnosis requires confirming mycobacteria via tests like GeneXpert, and while cancer antigen 125 can be elevated, it is not specific. Treatment is a standard anti-TB regimen, with most patients improving without surgery. Ovarian tuberculosis, often mistaken for ovarian tumors, requires thorough evaluation in young patients, especially those from low-resource settings, to avoid unnecessary surgery and prevent complications like infertility.",

To assess the prognostic importance of pretreatment lymph node (LN) characteristics to optimize case distribution and outcome homogeneity within the N classification system. This is an international multi-institutional retrospective prognostic cohort study. Analysis of human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma treated curatively from 4 institutions (International Collaboration of Oropharyngeal Cancer Network for N-Classification [ICON-N] dataset) provided a refined clinical staging proposal; an independent dataset (Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal [CHUM] dataset) validated the proposal. Neuroradiologists reviewed pretreatment computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging for nodal features, including presence or absence of abnormal LN(s), retropharyngeal LN, laterality, number of abnormal LN, and imaging-detected extranodal extension (iENE). Data were collected from February to May 2023, and data were analyzed from June to July 2023. Definitive chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy or definitive surgery with or without postoperative chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. The primary end point was overall survival. A Cox proportional hazards multivariable model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) and to derive an optimal clinical TNM stage classification (AHR-stage schema) incorporating the strongest prognostic nodal features within the UICC/AJCC eighth edition TNM framework after confirming the prognostication of iENE status. The performance (according to overall normalized scores and ranking) of the AHR-stage schema against the current UICC/AJCC eighth edition TNM staging system was evaluated for hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, prognostic importance, and sample size balance. Validation was performed in the CHUM dataset. The ICON-N dataset comprised 2053 patients, including 1898 (92.5%) with cN-positive disease and 155 (7.5%) with cN0 disease; a total of 298 (14.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 60.6 (9.3) years. iENE-positive disease was identified in 710 of 1898 patients with cN-positive disease (37.4%). The median (range) follow-up was 5.1 (0.1-14.7) years. iENE was the strongest prognostic nodal feature in multivariable analysis; the AHR for iENE-positive vs iENE-positive disease was 2.43 (95% CI, 1.96-3.03) in the ICON-N dataset and 2.04 (95% CI, 1.28-3.23) in the CHUM dataset (n = 451). Reclassifying iENE-positive cases 1 stratum higher for N categorization without altering iENE-negative cases yielded an AHR-stage schema that outperformed the current TNM staging system in disease-free and overall survival with a lower (ie, better) overall normalized score (2 vs 3). In this study, reclassifying each N category 1 stratum higher for iENE-positive disease resulted in better disease-free and overall survival. The proposed new classification outperformed the currently TNM staging system in risk stratification and may facilitate future clinical trial design, outcomes research, and patient care.",

Genetic diagnosis can eliminate unnecessary tests and ensure appropriate follow-up and treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the etiology of CC without known etiological reasons in 10 families using whole exome sequencing (WES).MethodsTen families participated in this study, with all patients undergoing comprehensive ophthalmological, metabolic, and genetic assessments. DNA samples from the probands were analyzed using WES, and variants were verified and validated through Sanger sequencing.ResultsOf the 10 patients diagnosed with isolated CC, 9 (90%) had bilateral cataracts, and 1 (10%) had unilateral cataract. Nuclear type cataracts were detected in 8 (80%) patients, while polar type cataracts were found in 2 (20%) patients. Parental consanguinity was present in 7 out of the 10 families. An unidentified variant in the   gene (c.491C > G) associated with Martsolf syndrome was found in one patient. Two novel and one previously identified gene variants associated with CC were detected in 3 of the remaining 9 patients: a novel c.463C > T in  , a previously identified c.965dup in  , and a novel c.3330C > A in  .ConclusionThe high rate of consanguineous marriages in Turkey (23.3%) increases the incidence of autosomal recessive (AR) diseases, explaining the higher prevalence of AR CC despite its usual autosomal dominant inheritance. In conclusion, WES is a valuable tool in determining the etiology of isolated CC.",

This study aimed to investigate the effect of the number of NLNs removed on OC patients' survival and recurrence rate after primary surgery. In this multi-center cohort study, the medical profile of 504 OC patients (mean age 55.21 years and mean follow-up 78.5 ± 28.4 months) who underwent primary surgery between 2011 and 2021 in gynecological tumor surgery centers affiliated with Iran and Shahid Beheshti Universities of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, was retrospectively examined. Based on the number of NLNs removed, patients were divided into four groups, including 0-9, 10-19, 20-30, and > 30 NLNs, including 152, 169, 124, and 59 OC patients, respectively. The 5-year survival was 49.1%. The median survival was 61 months. The RFS and OS were significantly better in patients with more than 30 NLNs removed compared to other groups. The multivariable analysis showed that the OS rate was significantly better in patients with the number of NLNs removed ≥ 20 compared to < 20 (HR, 1.88; 95% CI 1.15-2.62;  , 0.001). Also, age, FIGO stage, presence of metastasis, adjuvant therapy, and tumor pathological differentiation were significantly related to the OS of OC patients (  < 0.05). Paying attention to the number of NLNs removed during primary surgery can be a key factor in improving the OS rate of OC patients.",

  "abstract": "Dedifferentiation of epithelial cells during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) results in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that are mobilized singly or in clusters in association with blood cells and results in metastasis. However, lineage tracing studies have failed to delineate any role of EMT during metastasis. Research is also focused on polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) in solid tumors which appear in response to oncotherapy-related stress for their role in metastasis. But how to explain PGCCs role in metastatic tumors in treatment-naïve patients? Studies done using mouse models and clinical samples suggest that cancer initiates due to dysfunctions of tissue-resident, pluripotent very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs). VSELs are the most primitive and pluripotent stem cells that exist at top of cellular hierarchy in multiple tissues. They are normally quiescent and undergo asymmetrical cell divisions to give rise to two cells of different sizes and fates including smaller cells to self-renew and bigger tissue-specific progenitors. Progenitors undergo symmetrical cell divisions and clonal expansion (rapid proliferation, endoduplication with incomplete cytokinesis) to form giant cells that further breakdown and differentiate into tissue-specific cell types. Oncotherapy destroys actively dividing cells, but CSCs survive. We hypothesize that excessive self-renewal and clonal expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs, dysfunctional VSELs) result in multinucleated giant cells (PGCCs) that accumulate as further differentiation into tissue-specific cell types is blocked in cancerous conditions. PGCCS are being reported by multiple groups whereas CSCs remain elusive due to small size and low abundance and actually contribute to both cancer initiation and metastasis.",

  "abstract": "To analyze the risk factors associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), with the goal of enhancing early diagnosis and treatment, preventing complications, and improving patient outcomes. The study involved 23 pediatric patients with HSP who experienced gastrointestinal bleeding, forming the study group. They were admitted to our hospital from June 2023 to June 2024. For comparison, a control group composed of 44 children with HSP but without gastrointestinal bleeding, admitted during the same timeframe, was established. Data on clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and imaging findings were collected. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify potential risk factors. A total of 67 children with HSP were divided into two groups: those with gastrointestinal bleeding (23 cases) and those without (44 cases). The occurrence of abdominal pain and incidence of intestinal wall thickening detected by gastrointestinal ultrasonography were significantly higher in the group with gastrointestinal bleeding compared to the group without bleeding (  < 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in eight laboratory parameters (WBC, NE, NLR, PCT, CRP, D-dimer, Fib, TT), all statistically significant (  < 0.05). Multivariate analysis identified three independent risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding in children with HSP: abdominal pain (OR = 2.334, 95% CI: 0.458-11.886,   = 0.010), a PCT level above 0.12 ng/ml (OR = 10.010, 95% CI: 1.208-82.929,   = 0.033), and a D-dimer level exceeding 1.87 mg/L (OR = 3.407, 95% CI: 1.022-17.473,   < 0.001). The findings confirmed that abdominal pain, elevated PCT levels, and increased D-dimer are significant independent risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding in pediatric patients with Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Clinicians should monitor these indicators attentively to enhance patient management and outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Historically, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (HSD17B3) was thought to be the key enzyme responsible for testicular testosterone production. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in HSD17B3 impair testosterone production during prenatal life leading to impaired development of androgen-dependent tissues in 46,XY individuals. However, male mice with HSD17B3 deficiency exhibit normal testicular testosterone concentrations, normal development of reproductive organs and are fertile, suggesting that mice express other hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes capable of testicular testosterone synthesis. This study aimed to investigate whether 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (HSD17B12), which can convert androstenedione to testosterone in mice but not in humans, compensates for the lack of HSD17B3 in Hsd17b3 knockout (KO) mice. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to substitute the amino acid in mouse HSD17B12 that is responsible for its ability to convert androstenedione to testosterone with the amino acid of the human enzyme that prevents androstenedione being used as a substrate. When this Hsd17b12 mutation was introduced into Hsd17b3 KO mice, males exhibited normal reproductive tracts but reduced testicular testosterone production with a consequential reduction in seminal vesicle weight. This suggests HSD17B12 contributes toward testosterone production in the absence of HSD17B3, but other enzymes must also contribute. We therefore quantified other testicular hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, finding that HSD17B7 mRNA and protein was markedly upregulated in Hsd17b3 KO testes. We confirmed that mouse, but not human, HSD17B7 can produce testosterone in vitro. We conclude that compared to humans, mice exhibit increased plasticity in testosterone production via hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes to support androgen action and male fertility.",

Surgical approaches included laparoscopy in 23 (59.0%) cases, robotic assistance in 13 (33.3%), and 2 cases were converted from laparoscopy to laparotomy. Advanced techniques utilized included ureterolysis, enterolysis, diaphragm resection, bowel shaving, bowel disc resection, segmental bowel resection, appendectomy, partial bladder cystectomy, and hypogastric nerve sparing. Intraoperative complications included 1 ureteral thermal injury and 1 bladder laceration. Postoperative complications consisted of 1 pyelonephritis and 1 incisional cellulitis. No complications related to urinary or bowel functional disorders occurred postoperatively. Among the 19 patients who regularly used pain medication before surgery, 16 patients discontinued pain medications, while 3 patients reduced their usage after surgery. Eight patients are actively trying to conceive, and 1 patient conceived spontaneously. Sixteen patients are receiving various forms of hormonal suppression. With excellent skills and collaboration, the surgical management of endometriosis resulted in minimal complications and optimal postoperative outcomes, significantly benefiting patients in low socioeconomic areas.",

However, safety data for the Indian population are lacking. The current post-marketing surveillance study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Gla-300 in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from India. SAFEGUARD was a multicenter, phase 4, single-arm, open-label, 24-week study conducted at 15 centers across India between August 10, 2021 and December 26, 2022. The study included insulin-naïve participants (aged ≥ 18 years) with T2D uncontrolled (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 10%) on oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs) and hypoglycemic episodes. Of the 220 participants included, 218 (36.8% female) were eligible for efficacy analysis. The mean ± standard deviation age was 54.0 ± 9.6 years, the baseline HbA1c was 8.8 ± 0.9%, and the duration of T2D was 9.3 ± 7.0 years. Among the 220 participants who took at least one dose of Gla-300, 24.5% (n = 54) reported 64 TEAEs, which included one (0.5%) SAE. The most reported event was infections (10.9%). In total, 29.5% of participants (n = 65) reported a level 1 hypoglycemic event, and 27.7% of participants (n = 18) reported the main symptom of sweating. Glycemic control improved with reductions in mean HbA1c levels (- 1.14 ± 1.2%), fasting plasma glucose (- 37.0 ± 59.3 mg/dl), and fasting self-monitored blood glucose (- 52.0 ± 44.1 mg/dl) from baseline to week 24. Gla-300 was well tolerated with improved glycemic control and a low hypoglycemia risk in insulin-naïve people with T2D living in India.

Data were analysed by age, sex, and socio-demographic index, presenting total numbers and contributions to burden metrics such as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years Lived with Disability (YLD), and Years of Life Lost (YLL). Approximately 68% of DALYs were attributed to chronic care, while 27% were due to acute care. Chronic care needs increased with age, representing 86% of YLDs and 71% of YLLs, and accounting for 93% of YLDs from sequelae. These findings highlight that chronic care needs far exceed acute care needs globally, necessitating health systems to adapt accordingly.",

  "abstract": "Alcohol consumption may induce multiple disorders, and decreased alcohol consumption has been proved to be effective to reduce the incidence of alcohol-associated diseases and mortality. Pharmacotherapy is the most common option for the management of alcohol problems; however, it suffers from multiple problems. Non-pharmaceutical interventions are therefore of urgent need to change alcohol intake among alcohol users. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), which encodes the ALDH2 gene, is an important enzyme in ethanol metabolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that individuals harboring ALDH2 gene mutations are more likely to present discomfort symptoms and are more susceptible to multiple cancers. It is hypothesized that ALDH2 gene testing may reduce alcohol consumption and the incidence of alcohol-associated disorders among unhealthy alcohol users. A single-center, open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial was designed, aiming to recruit 940 unhealthy alcohol users at ages of 18 to 60 years. All participants are randomized into the interventional and control groups, and both groups are given alcohol consumption health education. In addition, blood samples are collected from participants in the interventional group for ALDH2 gene testing, with testing reports issued, while ALDH2 gene testing is not performed in the control group. Changes in alcohol intake, hazardous drinking days, and alcohol-associated adverse events are recorded prior to and post-interventions. The primary outcome is alcohol intake, and the secondary outcomes are hazardous drinking days and alcohol-associated adverse events. This trial will provide strong evidence regarding the impact of ALDH2 gene testing on alcohol use behaviors. The study has been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration no. ChiCTR2400087726) on 2 August 2024.",

Low-income Black/African American/of African descent (Black) individuals are at greater risk for perinatal mental health issues and face more obstacles to care due to a variety of barriers, including poor implementation of screening protocols, stigma, adverse experiences of social determinants of health, and distrust of healthcare systems. These disparities are particularly striking in Washington, DC, and worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Outcomes will be tracked from pregnancy through 12 months postpartum, assessing maternal mental health, engagement with the intervention, healthcare experiences and utilization, and infant outcomes. If found to be efficacious, results will help develop scalable, culturally relevant interventions aimed at reducing racial disparities in maternal mental health care and improving health outcomes for both mothers and infants.

  "abstract": "The therapeutic landscape for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) continues to evolve, raising critical questions about the optimal integration of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to improve patient outcomes. Historically, WBRT has been a cornerstone in PCNSL management, offering effective disease control and relapse prevention. However, the use of high-dose WBRT (HD-WBRT) (≥ 36 Gy), while efficacious, has been associated with significant neurotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients, which has curtailed its long-term applicability. In recent years, high-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT) has emerged as a consolidative treatment option, demonstrating efficacy comparable to WBRT, especially in younger patients and those with better performance status, thereby reshaping the therapeutic paradigm. As the therapeutic paradigm shifts, efforts to explore advances in WBRT techniques, such as dose reduction (23.4 Gy) and hyperfractionated protocols, have been aimed at mitigating neurotoxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. These innovations make WBRT a viable option for carefully selected patient populations. Furthermore, this review explores emerging strategies, including localized radiotherapy, novel therapeutic combinations, and individualized treatment paradigms, while identifying key directions for future research to optimize outcomes for PCNSL patients.",

  "abstract": "Hypercalcemia, a common electrolyte imbalance, requires accurate differential diagnosis to guide appropriate management. PTH-dependent hypercalcemia, predominantly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and rarely by familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)-mainly due to heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the CASR gene encoding the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR)-now includes acquired hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (AHH) as an emerging disease entity. Initially identified as analogous to FHH, AHH was characterized by blocking antibodies targeting the CaSR. However, our research has identified unique autoantibodies, termed biased antibodies, that paradoxically regulate signaling by enhancing Gq activity while suppressing Gi activity. Investigating their mechanisms has not only provided insights into specific treatments for AHH but also suggested novel activation mechanisms and binding sites of the CaSR, offering a fresh perspective on the regulation of PTH secretion. In clinical practice, recognizing AHH is crucial. A key diagnostic feature is fluctuating serum calcium levels, making a wait-and-see approach viable for mild hypercalcemia. Conversely, hypercalcemic crises necessitate immediate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. The most important diagnostic clue to differentiate AHH from PHPT is hypermagnesemia. Additionally, AHH is less likely to involve AVP resistance (i.e., nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) and acute kidney injury (AKI), owing to preserved medullary hyperosmolarity and minimal interference with AVP signaling. Finally, a relatively low PTH level serves as another distinguishing feature. Based on these observations, we propose a novel diagnostic guide for PTH-dependent hypercalcemia. We anticipate that this guide will help identify previously undiagnosed AHH cases in routine practice, enabling timely and effective management of this rare condition.",

  "abstract": "WITKOS is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the 15q24.1 - q24.2 region, includeing switch-insensitive 3 transcription regulator family member A (SIN3 A). Its incidence rate is extremely low. According to the current limited global data statistics, only a few cases occur per million population. Most cases concentrate in childhood and adolescence. During this stage, the rapid physiological changes of the body seem to be closely related to the triggering of the disease. Its characteristics include unique facial features, intellectual and motor developmental delay, and short stature. This paper reports a case of WITKOS in a 4-month-old infant caused by large-fragment copy number variation in the 15q24.1 - q24.2 region of the chromosome that encompasses the SIN3 A gene. Gene mutations lead to abnormal functions of key proteins, which subsequently disrupt the normal development and operation of multiple body systems., By summarizing its gene phenotype characteristics, it provides diagnostic and treatment ideas for clinicians to screen for developmentally deviated young children. It is expected to provide more effective treatment options for WITKOS to improve the prognosis of patients. This infant was diagnosed with WITKOS at 4 months of age. Subsequently, the manifestations included a wide forehead, a low nasal bridge, low-set ears, growth and intellectual developmental delay, low muscle tone in the limbs, and feeding difficulties. After early rehabilitation training, the language and motor abilities of this infant have been effectively improved, and currently, the infant can walk and run independently and can say short sentences independently. For children with WITKOS, early diagnosis of the clinical symptoms they exhibit and rehabilitation intervention should be carried out, which can effectively improve the quality of life of the children. This report is the first case of WITKOS caused by a large - fragment deletion, further enriching the case data of WITKOS and highlighting the necessity of strengthening clinical management and monitoring.",

  "abstract": "BackgroundWhile research has identified many associations between socioeconomic factors and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) nonsuppression, few qualitative studies have defined the mechanisms by which these factors interrelate and lead to HIV nonsuppression. The development of interventions to achieve universal virologic suppression and eliminate transmission will require a deeper understanding of the individual and social processes that drive antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence and consequent viral nonsuppression.MethodsWe used a semistructured interview-based case-study approach to characterize changes across 3 time points in the lived contexts of 11 adolescents and young adults (aged 15-24 years) from intervention and control arms of a longitudinal HIV intervention trial in rural Kenyan and Ugandan communities. We sought to determine commonalities among those who never virally suppressed, those who became nonsuppressed, and those who moved from nonsuppression to viral suppression, exploring social and behavioral micro-processes or causal chains observed among individuals who share these trajectories.ResultsWe found that supportive family environments, high-quality service provision, and residential and partnership stability free of violence, or that permitted freedom to move and maintain extensive social ties both inside and outside one's immediate community, enabled ART adherence. We also found that several factors combine to have effects beyond each individual factor taken singly, for example, medication side effects were influenced by food insecurity; disclosure was most effective with individuals around whom one may potentially take medication, such as co-resident partners; and mobility compromised adherence when patients did not know how or where to access care in new places.RecommendationsOur findings suggest that to improve virologic suppression, clinical care and interventions should include assessment and strategies to address food insecurity, ART disclosure, and home-based violence from intimate partners or other family members. When such factors are present, we suggest referral for services, including violence prevention and protection services, and food provision for those patients who do not adhere because of medication side effects amplified by lack of food. We further recommend that clinics coordinate regionally to anticipate mobility, facilitate transfer of care to other areas, and ensure clients have access to information about care clinics elsewhere in the region.

  "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for brain homeostasis but is a major obstacle in delivering anticancer drugs to brain tumors. However, this perspective requires re-evaluation, particularly for malignant brain tumors, such as gliomas and brain metastases. In these aggressive tumors, the BBB undergoes significant alterations, leading to the formation of a more permeable blood-tumor barrier. While this increased permeability allows better drug penetration, heterogeneity in blood-tumor barrier (BTB) integrity across different tumor regions remains a challenge. Additionally, the main challenge in treating brain tumors lies not in BBB penetration but in the lack of effective drugs. Conventional chemotherapies, including temozolomide and nitrosourea agents, have shown limited efficacy, and resistance mechanisms often reduce their long-term benefits. The \"BBB curse\" has often been blamed for the slow progress in drug development. However, emerging evidence suggests that even larger-molecule therapies, such as antibody-drug conjugates, can successfully target brain tumors. This review aims to critically reassess the roles of the BBB and BTB in brain tumor therapy, highlighting their impact on drug delivery and evaluating the current landscape of chemotherapeutic strategies. Furthermore, it explores new approaches to overcome treatment limitations, emphasizing the need for personalized and targeted therapeutic strategies.",

  "abstract": "Malnutrition is a critical complication among cancer patients, affecting up to 80% of individuals depending on cancer type, stage, and treatment. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare, with potential applications in nutritional management to improve early detection, risk stratification, and personalized interventions. This systematic review evaluates the role of AI in identifying and managing malnutrition in cancer patients, focusing on its effectiveness in nutritional status assessment, prediction, clinical outcomes, and body composition monitoring. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Excerpta Medica Database from June to July 2024, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Quantitative primary studies investigating AI-based interventions for malnutrition detection, body composition analysis, and nutritional optimization in oncology were included. Study quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tools, and evidence certainty was evaluated with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine framework. Eleven studies (n=52,228 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into three overarching domains: Nutritional Status Assessment and Prediction, Clinical and Functional Outcomes, and Body Composition and Cachexia Monitoring. AI-based models demonstrated high predictive accuracy in malnutrition detection (AUC >0.80). Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, outperformed conventional screening tools. Deep learning models applied to medical imaging achieved high segmentation accuracy (Dice Similarity Coefficient: 0.92-0.94), enabling early cachexia detection. AI-driven virtual dietitian systems improved dietary adherence (84%) and reduced unplanned hospitalizations. AI-enhanced workflows streamlined dietitian referrals, reducing referral times by 2.4 days. AI has demonstrated significant potential in optimizing malnutrition screening, body composition monitoring, and personalized nutritional interventions for cancer patients. Its integration into oncology nutrition care could enhance patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation. Further research is necessary to standardize AI models and ensure clinical applicability. 10.17605/OSF.IO/A259M STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This systematic review highlights the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence in oncology nutrition by demonstrating its superior accuracy in malnutrition detection, body composition monitoring, and personalized dietary interventions. Unlike previous studies, which focused on isolated AI applications, this work comprehensively evaluates AI-driven models across multiple clinical domains, emphasizing their integration into routine cancer care to enhance early detection, treatment personalization, and overall patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) represents the most prevalent endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age, affecting approximately 5-18% of females worldwide. Characterized by irregular ovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, hyperandrogenism is the defining feature. Recent evidence highlights that, in addition to its notable reproductive and metabolic consequences, PCOS may also contribute to an elevated risk of renal complications. This increased risk is attributed to chronic low-grade inflammation, hormonal dysregulation, and disturbances in lipid metabolism inherent to the condition. However, the pathological mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and progression of secondary renal damage in this cohort remain insufficiently studied. This review consolidates current understanding of the relationship between PCOS and chronic kidney disease (CKD), aiming to clarify potential mechanisms by which PCOS may induce secondary renal dysfunction, encompassing both direct renal impairment and indirect damage mediated through systemic alterations. Furthermore, it advocates for comprehensive management strategies to mitigate renal risks in patients with PCOS, emphasizing the necessity of multidisciplinary approaches and further research to address these critical gaps.",

  "abstract": "Elderly stroke patients generally have a lower quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of frailty and depression in the relationship between nutrition and quality of life in elderly stroke patients. The researcher used the convenience sampling method to select 193 cases of elderly stroke patients who were admitted to the Department of Neurology of a tertiary general hospital in Qingdao from July 2023 to March 2024, and the questionnaires were investigated using the General Information Questionnaire, the Tilburg Frailty Assessment Index Scale (TFI), the Depression Screening Scale (PHQ-9), the Simplified Quality of Life Scale for Stroke Patients (SV-SS-QoL), and the Mini-Nutrition Assessment Scale (MNA-SF). The incidence of malnutrition was 47.2% in elderly stroke patients, whereas the quality of life score was 43.00 (40.00, 47.00), frailty was 6.00 (2.00, 8.00), and depression was 6.00 (4.00, 7.00). The mediating effect analysis showed that the chain mediating effect of frailty and depression on nutrition and quality of life in elderly stroke patients was significant, with a total indirect effect of 0.155, the mediating effect of depression as the mediating variable accounted for 54.2% of the total indirect effect, the mediating effect of frailty as the mediating variable accounted for 25.2% of the total indirect effect, and the chain mediating effect of frailty and depression between nutrition and quality of life of elderly stroke patients accounted for 20.6% of the total indirect effect. It is proven that in elderly stroke patients, depression and frailty have a chain mediating effect on nutrition and quality of life. Healthcare professionals should quickly do nutritional assessments and take the necessary actions to enhance patients' nutritional status, prevent depression and frailty, and enhance their quality of life.",

  "abstract": "Chronic migraine (CM) affects approximately 2% of the general population and is defined by the persistence of migraine symptoms for at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months. CM is often refractory to common drug treatments and is associated with a significant burden in functions of daily life during ictal phases, productivity loss, and direct costs. Modulation of pain is considered pivotal to reduce its impact and to improve the quality of life among patients with CM. In recent years, neuromodulation in CM has received growing attention; however, there remains no consensus regarding the effectiveness and safety of these procedures. Previous invasive methods such as occipital nerve neurolysis and interruption of the trigeminal dorsal root are not indicated due to high rates of relapsing pain and frequent procedural complications. Although emerging neuromodulation methods, both noninvasive, such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), remote electrical neuromodulation (REM), and invasive, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), and high-frequency 10-Hz spinal cord stimulation (HF-10 SNS) have demonstrated promising outcomes in early clinical trials, their use has yet to be integrated into routine clinical practice. In this review, study evidence and strength of recommendations are assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Other conditions such as therapeutic risk/benefit, direct and indirect costs, use of resources, and patient/clinician preferences are also evaluated.",

  "abstract": "Gait and key-tapping are individually associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, it is unclear if these motor functions are correlated, or whether combining them improves classification of objective (dementia, MCI) and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI). We recruited 73 participants with dementia, 106 MCI, 57 SCI, and 83 cognitively healthy controls (HC). Consensus diagnosis was made after gold-standard interdisciplinary assessment. Fast-paced gait was assessed on an electronic walkway and fast-paced key-tapping on a computer keyboard. Correlations between gait and key-tapping measures (speed, frequency, variability and contact) were tested using Pearson's correlation. Classification accuracy was calculated using area under receiver-operating-characteristic curves (AUC) and compared to the null model comprising age, sex and education. Gait and key-tapping measures correlated moderately. Combined gait and key-tapping speed improved classification accuracy of dementia (.97), and MCI (.91), from HC, but not SCI, compared to gait (dementia: .94, MCI: .87) or the null model (dementia: .89, MCI: .79). Gait and key-tapping measures were associated with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, but the effect size for key-tapping variability was larger in vascular dementia (β: 225.71) compared to Alzheimer's disease (β: 38.30). Gait and key-tapping variability was associated with non-amnestic MCI. Measures of gait were correlated with corresponding key-tapping measures, but their association with cognitive impairment was not the same. Combining gait and key-tapping motor measures improved classification accuracy of MCI and dementia. This suggests gait and key-tapping measures provide information about different aspects of motor-cognitive association worth further investigation.",

  "abstract": "The preservation of the pelvic autonomic nervous system in total mesorectal excision remains challenging to date. The application of laparoscopy has enabled visualization of fine anatomical structures; however, the rate of urogenital dysfunction remains high. To establish an artificial intelligence neurorecognition system to perform neurorecognition during total mesorectal excision. This is a retrospective study. The study was conducted at a single hospital. Intraoperative images or video screenshots of patients with rectal cancer admitted to the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, between January 2016 and December 2023, were retrospectively collected. Mean intersection over union, precision, recall, and F1 of the model. A total of 1424 high-quality intraoperative images were included in the training group. The proposed model was obtained after 700 iterations. The mean intersection over union was 0.75, and it slowly increased with an increase in training time. The precision and recall of the nerve category were 0.7494 and 0.6587, respectively, and the F1 was 0.7011. The video prediction shows that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, which could facilitate effective neurorecognition. This was a single-center study. The artificial intelligence model for real-time visual neurorecognition in total mesorectal excision was successfully established for the first time in China.

  "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug-resistance protein is one of the most extensively studied efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Changes in P-gp function are associated with several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia and with the bioavailability of several pharmaceuticals in the brain, causing multi-drug resistance or side effects. PET imaging can be used to measure the P-gp function in vivo. This study aims to validate [ F]MC225 as specific P-gp PET tracer with the use of cyclosporin as selective P-gp inhibitor. Fourteen healthy volunteers (age 67 ± 5y) were included. Subjects underwent twice a 60 min dynamic [ F]MC225 (200MBq) PET scan with continuous arterial blood sampling and a cerebral T1-weighted MRI as anatomical reference. During the second scan, in five subjects, cyclosporin was administered in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/hour, starting 30 min prior to the scan, to inhibit the BBB P-gp function. Tissue time-activity curves of preselected brain regions (Hammer's atlas) were fitted to a reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k) using the metabolite corrected plasma and uncorrected whole blood curves as input functions. No significant difference was found in plasma kinetics, plasma curves, plasma-to-whole blood ratio, and the parent fraction of the baseline scans and scans after administration of cyclosporin. Volume of distribution values in whole brain grey matter showed a significant increase (6.18 ± 1.29 to 9.00 ± 1.29 mL·cm p = 0.03) after the administration of cyclosporin. The outcomes of the current study reflect the potential ability of [ F]MC225 to measure cyclosporin induced changes in P-gp function at the human BBB in vivo. EudraCT 2020-001564-28.",

  "abstract": "Desmoplastic reaction is recognized as a prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, its significance in locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains underexplored. To assess the prognostic value of desmoplastic reaction in specimens from patients with advanced rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy. This was a retrospective study. This study was conducted at a single comprehensive cancer center. The study included 255 patients with advanced rectal cancer who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision from 2005 to 2014. Desmoplastic reaction was classified into mature, intermediate, and immature categories based on histological analysis. The primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Desmoplastic reaction was classified as mature (69.0%), intermediate (5.5%), or immature (25.5%). The mature group had a higher percentage of good responders (34.1%) compared with the intermediate (0%) and immature (4.6%) groups ( p < 0.0001). The mature group correlated with better outcomes, with a higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (85.4%) and overall survival (93.0%) as compared with intermediate (45.1% and 76.2%, respectively) and immature (65.8% and 88.8%, respectively) groups. In the multivariable analysis, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was significantly associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Among poor responders, intermediate/immature desmoplastic reaction was associated with poorer recurrence-free survival ( p = 0.03). Adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate for the mature group (adjuvant chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy, 86.4% vs 84.8%; p = 0.64), with worse trends observed in the intermediate/immature combined group (55.9% vs 69.4%, respectively, p = 0.27). The limitations include the subjective nature of the desmoplastic reaction assessment and the retrospective design of the study. Desmoplastic reaction in surgical specimens after chemoradiotherapy is associated with responses to chemoradiotherapy and serves as a significant prognostic factor in advanced rectal cancer, particularly for those responding poorly to chemoradiotherapy.

In this secondary analysis of data from SPRINT-MS, a phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ibudilast for progressive MS, we evaluated performance on Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Selective Reminding Test (SRT) in relation to physical disability, brain volume assessed with magnetic resonance imaging, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness over 96-week follow-up. We hypothesize that trial participants would show a decline in cognitive test scores over 96 weeks of follow-up, with a possible between-group difference in favor of ibudilast. Data from 255 participants were analyzed. On average, physical outcome measures, brain parenchymal fraction, and RNFL thickness worsened; average SDMT and SRT scores remained largely unchanged. There were no differences between treatment groups in cognitive outcomes at 96-week follow-up. Practice effects likely contributed to results. Observed stability of cognitive scores in individuals with progressive MS over 96-week follow-up may reflect true cognitive stability.

  "abstract": "Highly sensitive, accurate, and low-cost detection systems are gaining interest for early intervention in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Aβ), a peptide highly involved in the progression of AD, is found in abundance in patients with severe AD. This research focused on developing an Aβ oligomer (AβO) biosensor using a single-walled carbon nanotube-modified (SWCN) interdigitated electrode (IDE) sensor. The SWCN was functionalized onto the sensor surface through an amine linker, followed by the attachment of an aptamer-gold nanoparticle (GNP) complex, which was used to capture the AβO. The GNP-aptamer was saturated at 500 nM on the SWCN surface, and AβO was detected using a sandwich consisting of aptamer-AβO-antibody. The SWCN modification increased the number of aptamer attachment sites on the IDE, while the aptamer and antibody conjugation with GNP enhanced AβO interaction. This sandwich assay detected AβO at concentrations as low as 10 fM, with a linear regression coefficient [y = 2.9189x - 2.076; R2 = 0.9544]. Furthermore, AβO-spiked artificial CSF was detected without interference, as confirmed by the increased current responses. No significant changes were recorded with control proteins, including α-synuclein, IgG antibody, and a complementary aptamer, indicating specific AβO detection. This SWCN modified IDE-based sandwich detects AβO at its lower level and contributes to the early diagnosis of AD.",

  "abstract": "After neoadjuvant therapy, pathologic analysis of rectal cancer resected specimens may show a complete response in the primary tissue cancer with residual tumor in the lymph nodes (ypT0N+). The aim of this study was to describe the 5-year overall survival and factors associated with survival of ypT0N+ patients with rectal cancer who had neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery and to compare these patients' survival with patients in other pathologic categories. We conducted a retrospective analysis. We used the National Cancer Database. We identified patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent total neoadjuvant therapy or neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery between 2006 and 2016. Besides ypT0N+, 5 pathologic categories were identified: ypT0N0, ypT1-2N0, ypT3-4N0, ypT1-2N+, and ypT3-4N+. The primary outcome measure was 5-year overall survival. We included 30,751 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma. A total of 342 patients developed ypT0N+, of whom 181 (52.9%) received total neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients who received total neoadjuvant therapy, developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, ypT0N+ disease was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+. There were no differences in 5-year overall survival between ypT0N+ and ypT3-4N0 or ypT1-2N+. Similar findings were noticed among patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy. For patients with ypT0N+, older age, male gender, and higher number of positive lymph nodes were all associated with a decrease in the overall survival. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study, lack of variables describing the chemotherapy and radiation regimens used, and paucity of data on disease-specific survival or recurrence. Developing ypT0N+ was associated with a lower 5-year overall survival than ypT0N0 and ypT1-2N0. However, it was associated with a higher 5-year overall survival than ypT3-4N+.

  "abstract": "This work aimed to develop a new and simple method to establish a mouse model of vascular dementia (VD). We investigated whether a new nitric oxide metabolite in the botanical mixture (a NO-donating botanical mixture, NOBM) improved learning and memory in mice that underwent bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). C57BL/6N mice received the NOBM orally (0.1 mL twice a day) after BCAS, from days 1 to 28. We assessed spatial memory using the Y maze and place recognition tests at 1 week and 4 weeks after the induction of BCAS. We quantified the parvalbumin protein in the cortex and hippocampus at 1 week and 4 weeks. We also quantified expression levels of neuronal nuclei, brainderived neurotrophic factor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the number of dead neurons performed Fluoro-Jade B staining 31 days after BCAS. NOBM significantly improved learning and memory behaviour in BCAS mice. Immunohistochemistry staining and Western blotting data showed a significantly higher protein expression of parvalbumin in the cortex and hippocampus of NOBM-treated BCAS animals, especially in the early stage of BCAS. Moreover, NOBM reduces neuronal loss in the cortex and reduces neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. The observed effect suggests that the NOBM reduced the loss of parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons in the early stage of VD and inhibited neuroinflammation in the VD mice model. Our results reveal a potential neuroprotective and therapeutic use of NOBM for cognitive dysfunction associated with cerebral hypoperfusion in a mouse model of VD.",

  "abstract": "Prospective payment models have incentivized reductions in length of stay after surgery. The benefits of abbreviated postoperative hospitalization could be undermined by increased readmissions or postacute care use, particularly for older adults or those with comorbid conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hospitals with accelerated postsurgical discharge accrue total episode savings or incur greater postdischarge payments among patients stratified by age and comorbidity. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. National data from the 100% Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files for July 2012 to June 2015 were used. We included Medicare beneficiaries undergoing elective colectomy and stratified the cohort by age (65-69, 70-79, ≥80 y) and Elixhauser comorbidity score (low: ≤0; medium: 1-5; and high: >5). Patients were categorized by the hospital's mode length of stay, reflecting \"usual\" care. In a multilevel model, we compared mean total episode payments and components thereof among age and comorbidity categories, stratified by hospital mode length of stay. Among 88,860 patients, mean total episode payments were lower in shortest versus longest length of stay hospitals across all age and comorbidity strata and were similar between age groups (65-69 y: $28,951 vs $30,566, p = 0.014; 70-79 y: $31,157 vs $32,044, p = 0.073; ≥80 y: $33,779 vs $35,771, p = 0.005) but greater among higher comorbidity (low: $23,107 vs $24,894, p = 0.001; medium: $30,809 vs $32,282, p = 0.038; high: $44,097 vs $46641, p < 0.001). Postdischarge payments were similar among length-of-stay hospitals by age (65-69 y: ∆$529; 70-79 y: ∆$291; ≥80 y: ∆$872, p = 0.25) but greater among high comorbidity (low: ∆$477; medium: ∆$480; high: ∆$1059; p = 0.02). Administrative data do not capture patient-level factors that influence postacute care use (preference, caregiver availability). Hospitals achieving shortest length of stay after surgery accrue lower total episode payments without a compensatory increase in postacute care spending, even among patients at oldest age and with greatest comorbidity.

  "abstract": "'Brain age' is a numerical estimate of the biological age of the brain and an overall effort to measure neurodegeneration, regardless of disease type. In multiple sclerosis, accelerated brain ageing has been linked to disability accrual. Artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising tool for the assessment and quantification of the impact of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the existence of numerous AI models, there is a noticeable lack of comparative imaging data for traditional machine learning versus deep learning in conditions such as multiple sclerosis. A retrospective observational study was initiated to analyse clinical and MRI data (4584 MRIs) from various scanners in a large longitudinal cohort (  = 1516) of people with multiple sclerosis collected from two institutions (Karolinska Institute and Oslo University Hospital) using a uniform data post-processing pipeline. We conducted a comparative assessment of brain age using a deep learning simple fully convolutional network and a well-established traditional machine learning model. This study was primarily aimed to validate the deep learning brain age model in multiple sclerosis. The correlation between estimated brain age and chronological age was stronger for the deep learning estimates (  = 0.90,   < 0.001) than the traditional machine learning estimates (  = 0.75,   < 0.001). An increase in brain age was significantly associated with higher expanded disability status scale scores (traditional machine learning:   = 5.3,   < 0.001; deep learning:   = 3.7,   < 0.001) and longer disease duration (traditional machine learning:   = 6.5,   < 0.001; deep learning:   = 5.8,   < 0.001). No significant inter-model difference in clinical correlation or effect measure was found, but significant differences for traditional machine learning-derived brain age estimates were found between several scanners. Our study suggests that the deep learning-derived brain age is significantly associated with clinical disability, performed equally well to the traditional machine learning-derived brain age measures, and may counteract scanner variability.",

  "abstract": "The Clavien-Dindo classification is widely used to report postoperative morbidity but may underestimate the severity of colectomy complications. The purpose of this study was to assess how well the Clavien-Dindo classification represents the severity of all grades of complications after colectomy using cost of care modeling. This was a retrospective cohort study. The study was conducted at a comprehensive cancer center. Consecutive patients (N = 1807) undergoing elective colon or rectal resections without a stoma performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2009 and 2014 who were followed up for ≥90 days, were not transferred to other hospitals, and did not receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy were included in the study. Complication severity was measured by the highest-grade complication per patient and attributable outpatient and inpatient costs. Associations were evaluated between patient complication grade and cost during 3 time periods: the 90 days after surgery, index admission, and postdischarge (<90 d). Of the 1807 patients (median age = 62 y), 779 (43%) had a complication; 80% of these patients had only grade 1 or 2 complications. Increasing patient complication grade correlated with 90-day cost, driven by inpatient cost differences (p < 0.001). For grade 1 and 2 patients, most costs were incurred after discharge and were the same between these grade categories. Among patients with a single complication (52%), there was no difference in index hospitalization, postdischarge, or total 90-day costs between grade 1 and 2 categories. The study was limited by its retrospective design and generalizability. The Clavien-Dindo classification correlates well with 90-day costs, driven largely by inpatient resource use. Clavien-Dindo does not discriminate well among patients with low-grade complications in terms of their substantial postdischarge costs. These patients represent 80% of patients with a complication after colectomy. Examining the long-term burden associated with complications can help refine the Clavien-Dindo classification for use in colectomy studies. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B521.

  "abstract": "The temporal relationship between cerebrovascular disease (V), indicated by white matter hyperintensities, and beta-amyloid (A) in Alzheimer's disease remains unclear, prompting speculation about their potential interdependence. Longitudinal data were employed to estimate onset ages and corresponding disease chronicity for A and V (where disease chronicity is calculated as age at measurement minus estimated age of biomarker abnormality onset). In a large, predominantly cognitively unimpaired dataset (  = 877, ages 43-93 years), a V+ threshold was identified, and Sampled Iterative Local Approximation (SILA) was utilized to illustrate the predictable accumulation trajectory of V post-onset. Investigating the temporal association between A and V onset ages and accumulation trajectories in preclinical years, four operationalizations of time were examined across two initially cognitively unimpaired samples (  = 240 primary sample from Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention;   = 123 replication sample from Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center): (i) chronological age, (ii) estimated V+ chronicity, (iii) years since baseline scan, and (iv) estimated A+ chronicity. Results indicated that while both diseases are age-related, their onsets and trajectories are independent of each other. In addition, results indicated that V and A accumulation trajectories were highly predictable relative to onset of positivity for each biomarker. Cognitive decline across multiple cognitive domains was fastest when both V and A were present based on last available amyloid PET and MRI scan, with greater A chronicity being a more salient predictor of cognitive decline in these samples.",

  "abstract": "Systemic inflammation contributes to the progression of malignancies. The preoperative lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio has recently been shown to predict survival of patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery, but its prognostic value remains unclear in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer. This study aimed to examine the prognostic values of inflammation-based prognostic scores in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, focusing on the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. This is a retrospective study from a prospectively collected database. This study was conducted at a high-volume multidisciplinary tertiary cancer center in Japan. The subjects were 756 consecutive patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who received systemic chemotherapy from 2000 to 2015. The prognostic value of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was evaluated by univariable and multivariable analyses. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was conducted to compare the prognostic impact of the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio with the impact of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, or the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score. The primary outcomes measured were the correlations of prognostic scores with overall survival. Median survival times of patients with high, intermediate, and low lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratios were 29.4, 19.3, and 13.1 months (p < 0.001). In all subgroups according to key prognostic factors (performance status, use of targeted agents, pretreatment CEA levels, tumor sidedness, M category, and primary tumor resection), patient prognosis could be clearly stratified into 3 groups by the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio. Multivariable analysis revealed that decreased lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was independently associated with reduced survival (low vs high: HR 1.96, p < 0.001; intermediate vs high: HR 1.44, p < 0.001). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio was the most sensitive predictor of survival among all inflammation-based prognostic scores on a continuous basis. This study was retrospective in nature. The lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio is a useful prognostic biomarker for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer and could contribute to accurate prognostication and therapeutic decision making.

Recientemente se ha demostrado que la proporción preoperatoria de linfocitos -proteína C reactiva predice la supervivencia de los pacientes con cáncer colorrectal que se sometieron a cirugía, pero su valor pronóstico sigue sin estar claro en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el valor pronostico de los scores inflamtorios centrandose en linfocito- proteina c reactiva en pacientes con cáncer colorrectal metastásico.DISEÑO:Estudio retrospective evaluando una base de datos.AJUSTE:Este estudio se llevó a cabo en un centro oncológico terciario multidisciplinario de gran volumen en Japón.PACIENTES:Se incluyeron 756 pacientes consecutivos todos con cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable que recibieron quimioterapia sistémica de 2000 a 2015. El valor pronóstico de la proteína C reactiva se evaluó mediante análisis univariables y multivariables. Se realizó análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo para comparar el impacto pronóstico de la proteína linfocito-C-reactiva con el de la proporción de neutrófilos a linfocitos, la proporción de plaquetas a linfocitos, la proporción de linfocitos a monocitos o la proporción de puntuación pronóstica segun escala de Glasgow modificada.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Correlacion de las puntuaciones pronósticas con la supervivencia global.RESULTADOS:La mediana de supervivencia de los pacientes con niveles altos, intermedios y bajos de proteína C reactiva de linfocitos fue de 29,4, 19,3 y 13,1 meses, respectivamente (p <0,001). En todos los subgrupos de acuerdo con los factores pronósticos clave (estado funcional, uso de agentes dirigidos, niveles de antígeno carcinoembrionario antes del tratamiento, lado del tumor, categoría M y resección del tumor primario), el pronóstico del paciente podría estratificarse claramente en tres grupos por linfocito a C- proteína reactiva. El análisis multivariable reveló que la disminución de linfocitos a proteína C reactiva se asoció de forma independiente con una supervivencia reducida (baja frente a alta: cociente de riesgo 1,96, p <0,001; intermedio frente a alto: cociente de riesgo 1,44, p <0,001). El análisis de la curva de características operativas del receptor dependiente del tiempo reveló que de linfocito a proteína C reactiva era el predictor de supervivencia más sensible entre todas las puntuaciones de pronóstico basadas en inflamación de forma continua.LIMITACIONES:Este estudio fue de naturaleza retrospectiva.CONCLUSIONES:La proteína C reactiva de linfocitos a C es un biomarcador pronóstico útil para el cáncer colorrectal metastásico irresecable y podría contribuir a un pronóstico preciso y a la toma de decisiones terapéuticas.

  "abstract": "Hereditary hyperekplexia (HKPX) is a rare neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations in glycine signaling genes, such as GLRB. We report two neonates with autosomal recessive HKPX2 due to a novel GLRB mutation (c.1414C>T, p.Arg472*). Case 1, a 1-month-old female, presented with severe startle responses and tonic episodes, normal EEG, and no developmental delays. Case 2, a 2-week-old male, showed similar symptoms but with generalized rhythmic ictal fast activity on EEG. Both had consanguineous parents and unremarkable brain MRIs. Whole exome sequencing identified the same homozygous GLRB mutation in both cases. Treatment with Clonazepam and Levetiracetam significantly improved symptoms. This is the first report of the c.1414C>T (p.Arg472*) mutation in GLRB, expanding the genetic spectrum of HKPX2. The differing EEG findings highlight the disorder's phenotypic variability. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications like hypoxia and SIDS. This article reports a novel GLRB mutation in two neonates with autosomal recessive HKPX2, presenting with divergent EEG findings.",

  "abstract": "Central obesity is associated with surgical difficulties, but few studies explore the relationship with long-term results after colon cancer surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perirenal fat surface area, a proxy for total visceral fat, and oncologic outcome after intestinal resection for colon cancer. We investigated the association between perirenal fat surface area (exposure) on recurrence and death (outcome) in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent for colon cancer. The study was conducted at Stockholm South General Hospital, serving a population of 600,000. Patients (N = 733) without metastases at diagnosis who had a preoperative CT and had undergone elective colon resection between 2006 and 2016 were included. We compared overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and cause-specific survival by perirenal fat surface area. Patients with high perirenal fat surface area (fourth quartile) had more often left-sided tumors (45% vs 32% in the first quartile) and experienced more postoperative complications (29% vs 13%), but there were no differences in pathologic T and N stage, radicality of surgery, or adjuvant chemotherapy treatment. Overall survival decreased by increasing cancer stage but was not different between perirenal fat surface area categories. The HR for recurrence-free survival per centimeter squared increase in perirenal fat surface area was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.01) adjusted for age, sex, ASA category, tumor location, and postoperative complication Clavien-Dindo ≥2. The cumulative incidence of recurrence with death as a competing risk was not statistically different between perirenal fat surface area categories (p = 0.06). Subgroup analyses showed a nonsignificant tendency for men with low perirenal fat surface area to have a lower risk of recurrence and women a higher risk. In all register-based studies there can be randomly distributed errors. The results can only be generalized to colon resections. Our cohort ranged over a large year span. We found no association between perirenal fat surface area and overall survival, recurrence-free survival, or cause-specific cumulative incidence of recurrence in patients undergoing colon resection for cancer.

ANTECEDENTES:La obesidad central está asociada con dificultades quirúrgicas, pero pocos estudios exploran la relación de los resultados a largo plazo después de cirugía de cáncer de colon.OBJETIVO:Investigar la asociación entre la superficie de la grasa perirrenal, como un indicador de la grasa visceral total y el resultado oncológico después de una resección intestinal por cáncer de colon.DISEÑO:Se estudió la asociación entre el área de la superficie de la grasa perirrenal (expuesta) con la recurrencia y la muerte (resultado) de pacientes sometidos a cirugía con intención curativa por cáncer de colon.AJUSTES:Atención brindada por el Hospital General del Sur de Estocolmo a una población de 600,000 habitantes.PACIENTES:Aquellos pacientes sin metástasis (n = 733) en el momento del diagnóstico que tuvieron una tomografía computada preoperatoria y que se sometieron a una resección electiva de colon entre 2006-2016.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Comparamos la sobrevida general, la sobrevida libre de recurrencia y la sobrevida específica de la causa, por área de superficie de grasa perirrenal.RESULTADOS:Los pacientes con una mayor área de superficie de grasa perirrenal (cuarto cuartil) tuvieron más frecuentemente tumores del lado izquierdo (45% frente a 32% en el primer cuartil) y sufrieron más complicaciones postoperatorias (29% frente a 13%), pero no hubieron diferencias en el Estadío patológico T y N, ni en lo radical de la cirugía o del tratamiento de quimioterapia adyuvante. La supervivencia general disminuyó al aumentar el estadio del cáncer, pero no fue diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal. La razón de riesgo para la sobrevida libre de recurrencia por aumento de cm2 en el área de la superficie grasa perirrenal fue de 1.00 (intervalo de confianza del 95%: 0.99-1.01) ajustada por edad, sexo, categoría de la Sociedad Americana de Anestesiólogos, ubicación del tumor y complicación postoperatoria según Clavien-Dindo ≥ 2) La incidencia acumulada de recurrencia con muerte como un riesgo competitivo no fue estadísticamente diferente entre las categorías de área de superficie grasa perirrenal (p = 0.06). Los análisis de subgrupos mostraron una tendencia no significativa para que los hombres con un área de superficie menor en grasa perirrenal tengan un menor riesgo de recurrencia y las mujeres un mayor riesgo.LIMITACIONES:En todos los estudios basados en registros puede haber errores distribuidos aleatoriamente. Los resultados solo pueden generalizarse a resecciones de colon. Nuestra cohorte osciló durante un gran lapso de años.CONCLUSIONES:No se encontró asociación entre el área de superficie de la grasa perirrenal y la sobrevida general, ni con la sobrevida libre de recurrencia o la incidencia acumulada de recurrencia específica de la causa en pacientes sometidos a resección de colon por cáncer.

  "abstract": "Watchful waiting in patients with rectal cancer with complete clinical response after chemoradiation therapy has gained increased popularity to avoid morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. Irradiation of the pelvis causes bowel dysfunction, but the effect on anorectal sensory function remains obscure in this patient category. The aim of this study was to characterize the sensory pathways of the gut-brain axis in patients with rectal cancer treated solely with chemoradiation therapy (nonconventional regime/dose) compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study. Sensory evaluation by rectal distension was performed and cortical evoked potentials were recorded during rapid balloon distensions of the rectum and anal canal. Latencies and amplitudes of cortical evoked potentials were compared, and the relative amplitude of 5 spectral bands from recorded cortical evoked potentials was used as an additional proxy of neuronal processing. Patients with rectal cancer solely with chemoradiation therapy (n = 13) a median of 3.2 years ago (range, 2.3-5.6 y) and healthy volunteers (n = 13) were included. Cortical evoked potentials were measured. Patients had 35% lower rectal capacity at a maximum tolerable volume (p = 0.007). We found no differences in rectal cortical evoked potential latencies (p = 0.09) and amplitudes (p = 0.38) between groups. However, spectral analysis of rectal cortical evoked potentials showed a decrease in θ (4-8 Hz) and an increase in β (12-32 Hz) band activity in patients (all p < 0.001). Anal cortical potentials showed an increase in α (8-12 Hz) and β and a decrease in γ (32-70 Hz) band activity (all p < 0.001) in patients compared with healthy volunteers. This is an explorative study of limited size. Chemoradiation therapy for distal rectal cancer causes abnormal cortical processing of both anal and rectal sensory input. Such central changes may play a role in symptomatic patients, especially when refractory to local treatments. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270. RESPUESTA NEURONAL ANORMAL A ESTÍMULOS RECTALES Y ANALES, EN PACIENTES TRATADOS POR CÁNCER RECTAL DISTAL, CON QUIMIORRADIOTERAPIA DE DOSIS ALTA, SEGUIDA DE ESPERA VIGILANTE: La espera vigilante en pacientes de cáncer rectal, con respuesta clínica completa después de la quimiorradiación, ha ganado una mayor popularidad en evitar la morbilidad y mortalidad asociadas con la cirugía. La irradiación de la pelvis causa disfunción intestinal, pero el efecto sobre la función sensorial ano-rectal sigue siendo no claro, en esta categoría de pacientes.El objetivo de este estudio, fue caracterizar las vías sensoriales del eje intestino-cerebro en pacientes con cáncer rectal, tratados únicamente con quimiorradiación (régimen / dosis no convencional), en comparación con voluntarios sanos.Es un estudio exploratorio.Se realizó una evaluación sensorial por distensión rectal y se registraron los potenciales evocados corticales, durante las distensiones rápidas con balón en recto y canal anal. Se compararon las latencias y amplitudes de los potenciales evocados corticales, y la amplitud relativa de cinco bandas espectrales registradas, de potenciales evocados corticales, se usaron como proxy adicional del procesamiento neuronal.Pacientes de cáncer rectal, únicamente con terapia de quimiorradiación (n = 13) mediana de 3.2 años (rango 2.3-5.6) y voluntarios sanos (n = 13).Potenciales evocados corticales.Pacientes tuvieron una capacidad rectal menor del 35%, al volumen máximo tolerable (p = 0.007). No encontramos diferencias en las latencias potenciales evocadas corticales rectales (p = 0.09) y amplitudes (p = 0.38) entre los grupos. Sin embargo, el análisis espectral de los potenciales evocados corticales rectales, mostró una disminución en theta (4-8 Hz) aumento en beta (12-32 Hz), y actividad en banda en pacientes (todos p <0.001). Los potenciales evocados corticales anales mostraron un aumento en alfa (8-12 Hz) y beta, disminución en gamma (32-70 Hz), y actividad en banda (todos p <0.001), en pacientes comparados a voluntarios sanos.Este es un estudio exploratorio de tamaño limitado.La quimiorradiación para el cáncer rectal distal, ocasiona procesos corticales sensoriales anormales anales y rectales. Tales cambios centrales pueden desempeñar un papel en pacientes sintomáticos, especialmente cuando son refractarios a tratamientos locales. Consulte Video Resumen en http://links.lww.com/DCR/B270.",
