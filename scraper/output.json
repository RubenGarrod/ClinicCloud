The gut microbiome has been associated with various neurological disorders, and certain drugs greatly disturb the microbiome. Our aim was to study the association of prenatal and childhood exposure (before the age of two) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, and the risk of childhood epilepsy. Using population-based registers, we included all live singleton births in Sweden from 2006 to 2017. Exposure was considered prescription(s) to antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, or H2-receptor antagonists (separately). Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. 708,903 mother-child dyads were included, and 0.5% of children had an epilepsy diagnosis. Average follow-up was 3.8\u2009years (IQR 1-6). Prenatal exposure to antibiotics (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18) and PPIs (aHR 1.38, 95% CI 1.17-1.65) were associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. Exposure to antibiotics (1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21), PPIs (3.40, 95% CI 2.47-4.68) and H2RAs (1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.64) before the age of two was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy after the age of two. Dose response analysis showed that one prescription of antibiotics in pregnancy or early life was not associated with an increased risk of epilepsy, while one prescription of PPIs in pregnancy or early life had an association. To conclude, our results support the hypothesis that microbiome modulating drugs are associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. This needs to be further validated in other studies, ideally including indications for drug use.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

This study aimed to analyze the impact of consolidation therapy among young patients with intracranial primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 55 young patients (age < 60 years) with intracranial primary DLBCL who achieved complete remission (CR) after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-based chemotherapy from March 2001 to October 2021. Among these patients, 33 patients received consolidation therapy, and 22 patients did not. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between the two groups via Kaplan-Meier analysis, the multivariate Cox proportional hazards method, and propensity score matching (PSM). The median follow-up time was 60.1 months. A total of 13 patients (23.6%) died, and 20 patients (36.4%) experienced recurrence. Patients who received consolidation therapy had higher 2-year OS (96.8% vs. 71.1%,   = 0.036) and DFS (90.9% vs. 56.4%,   = 0.006) rates than those without consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis after PSM revealed that consolidation therapy was an independent predictor of DFS (HR = 0.282, 95% CI = 0.084-0.942,   = 0.040). Furthermore, rituximab was an independent predictor of favorable OS, and performance status was an independent predictor of OS and DFS. Subgroup analysis showed rituximab significantly improved OS in patients without consolidation therapy (88.9% vs. 45.0%,   = 0.006), but not in those with consolidation therapy (95.0% vs. 100%,   = 0.528). Consolidation therapy improved DFS in young intracranial primary DLBCL patients achieving CR after HD-MTX-based chemotherapy. Autologous stem cell transplantation and radiotherapy showed comparable consolidation benefits. Good performance status correlated with favorable outcomes. Adding rituximab to induction chemotherapy may improve OS in patients without consolidation therapy, but it might be unnecessary for those eligible for consolidation. Further research involving a larger patient cohort is warranted to ascertain rituximab's efficacy.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

The HLCS gene has been identified as the source of pathogenic mutations associated with this condition. Cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency is another rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defects in cobalamin metabolism, attributable to mutations in the MMACHC gene. This disorder often leads to methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria and is classified into early-onset and late-onset types. The late-onset type is characterized by acute or chronic progressive neurological symptoms and behavioral disturbances. To date, there have been no documented cases worldwide of individuals diagnosed with both HCSD and cobalamin C deficiency. This report details the case of an 11-year-and-9-month-old female patient from China who presented with symptoms including vomiting, altered consciousness, and a rash. Laboratory evaluations indicated the presence of metabolic acidosis, methylmalonic aciduria, and homocystinuria. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in the MMACHC gene: c.482G\u00a0>\u00a0A (p.R161Q) and c.567dup (p.I190Yfs\u221713).

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) on the quality of life (QOL) of patients with MS.   Using valid keywords and searching through databases like Medlib, ScienceDirect, PubMed, etc., 10 articles published between 1999 and 2020 were collected. The inclusion criteria were developed based on clinical guidelines, focusing on studies involving adults with MS treated with IFN-\u03b2, with outcomes measuring QOL. The exclusion criteria included studies not in English, those involving pediatric populations, or those lacking a control group. In the reviewed studies, 14 scales of QOL were measured at the beginning and the end of treatment with IFN-\u03b2. The data were analyzed using the random effects model meta-analysis method with R software and Stata software. Publication bias was not significant. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q test and the I  index. In heterogeneous studies, subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used for meta-analysis. The random-effect model was used for analyses with I  of more than 50%.   A total number of 1320 people with an average age of 32.40 \u00b1 8.77 years were included in this study. On average, there was a slight decline in energy and satisfaction with sexual function scales (SSF), while a slight improvement was seen in the other 12 scales, following the treatment with IFN-\u03b2. However, no significant changes were observed in any of the QOL scales following treatment, except for health distress (HD) (P < 0.001), role limitation due to physical problems (RLPP) (P < 0.001), and role limitation due to emotional problems (RLEP) (P = 0.037), all of which showed a slight but natable improvement.

The classical experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (C-EAMG) mouse model has long been used by immunizing mice with acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo fish (T-AChR), combined with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). This mixture is administered via subcutaneous injections into the hind footpads and back, but CFA often causes strong inflammatory reactions, including lesions at the injection sites. Our objective was to develop a new EAMG model (N-EAMG) that is more compliant with animal welfare. C57Bl/6 mice were immunized twice weekly by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of T-AChR with a poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) adjuvant mix. Control mice were injected with either physiological saline or the adjuvant mix alone. Various doses and injection schedules were tested, and the new model was compared with C-EAMG. Clinical symptoms were scored, antibody subtypes against T-AChR and mouse AChR were measured, and NMJ morphology and functionality were evaluated. We demonstrate that the N-EAMG model is at least as effective as the C-EAMG model. Moreover, similar to the C-EAMG model, the N-EAMG model is characterized by the production of T-AChR and m-AChR antibodies. This model also exhibited alterations in transmission at the NMJ due to antibody attack, resulting in a decrease in AChR surface area and increased AChR fragmentation. Symptoms were similar in both models but appeared more rapidly in the N-EAMG model. In addition, investigating the sensitization mechanism, we showed that i.p. injections of T-AChR with the poly(I:C)/LPS adjuvant mix, led to the recruitment in monocytes and changes in the two peritoneal macrophage subpopulations that were able to phagocytose T-AChR. These observations suggest that macrophage subtypes, albeit with varying efficiency, present the T-AChR to immune cells, leading to a specific immune response and the development of anti-AChR antibodies. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that this novel EAMG model is as effective as the C-EAMG model and offers several advantages. In particular, this model is more suitable for animal welfare and can replace the classical model in preclinical and fundamental research.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

In vitro experiments were employed using human primary VICs with TSP-1 knockdown, cultured in osteogenic induction medium, and followed by analyses including western blot, alkaline phosphatase staining, alizarin red staining, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. In vivo experiments used two murine models of CAVD to determine the role of TSP-1 silencing on aortic valve calcification.

Healthy participants (n = 94, mean age 71.1\u00a0years SD 5.10, 56% female) were recruited to investigate the relationship between nutrient intake (protein, fibre, carbohydrate, fat), physical function (chair rise time, handgrip strength) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein (LBP); a marker of gut permeability. Linear regression models, adjusted for age, fat mass/fat free mass ratio, weight and gender, reported LBP changed by; -161.9\u00a0ng/mL (95% CI -323.0, -0.8) for every 1\u00a0g increase in daily fibre/1,000 kilocalories; 80.5\u00a0ng/mL (6.7, 154.2) for 1% increase in daily energy intake as fat; and -88.1\u00a0ng/mL (-146.7, -29.6) for 1% increase in daily energy as carbohydrates. When further adjusted for C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, LBP decreased by an additional 6.9\u00a0ng/mL for fibre, increased by an additional 4.0\u00a0ng/mL for fat and decreased by an additional 3.7\u00a0ng/mL for carbohydrate. These findings suggest that in healthy older adults' nutrient intake is associated with LBP, and CRP appears to slightly modify these associations. There were no associations between LBP and handgrip strength or chair rise time. Results suggest that fibre, fat, and carbohydrates are important for maintaining gut function, potentially mediated by inflammation in older adults, although further research is needed to explore the implications for physical function and CRP as a mediator.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

The two major paediatric cooperative groups provide different therapeutic protocols based on different staging and classification, initially developed to serve patients in North America and Europe, but also used in many other parts/regions of the world. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) has developed a structure whereby such complex information may be harmonised, and able to be applied to patients globally. An international expert panel consisting of paediatric pathologists and oncologists produced a set of items critical to cancer reporting and subjected these to review and discussion using the structured processes provided by the ICCR. A formal ICCR structure was assembled, and consensus surrounding elements and their application to different therapeutic protocols was developed. The data set underwent open international consultation. This resulted in the first international data set for Wilms tumour (WT) and other paediatric renal tumours, provided herein. The use of ICCR methods enables a full understanding of highly complex and often overlapping reporting elements by international experts, and the potential of developing a set of commonly applied data elements that are fully defined. This sets the groundwork for future consolidation of definitions and harmonisation of therapies for WT and other paediatric renal tumour patients.

OMVs were isolated and their characteristics were examined through transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting. PD-L1 expression was quantified via Western blot, while CD8+ T cell proliferation was measured using flow cytometry. Cytokine production (interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)) was evaluated using ELISA.

In CRC cells, treatment with AKK-derived OMVs (AKK-OMVs) significantly downregulated PD-L1 expression (p\u2009<\u20090.05) and markedly increased CD8+ T cell proliferation and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 (p\u2009<\u20090.01).

Additionally, AKK-OMVs-treated mice showed increased expression of immune activation markers within the tumor tissue, further indicating enhanced antitumor immunity. This study reveals that AKK-OMVs, particularly those containing Amuc_1434, can modulate PD-L1 expression and potentiate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in CRC.

This involved bacterial isolation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and analysis of potential factors that may have led to resistance, such as antibiotic prescribing and patient comorbidities. Descriptive statistics were therefore applied in SPSS for data analysis. The most common pathogen was Escherichia coli (70%) and exhibited significant resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 30% and to fluoroquinolones at 22%. Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains comprised 8% of   isolates.

Increased biocide usage in households, agriculture, livestock farming, industrial settings, and hospitals produces persistent chemical residues that pollute soil and aquatic environments. Such contaminants contribute to the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria and antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), facilitating their dissemination among humans, animals, and ecosystems. In this review, we conduct a critical assessment of four significant issues pertaining to this topic. Specifically, (i) the role of biocides in exerting selective pressure within the environmental resistome, thereby promoting the proliferation of resistant microbial populations and contributing to the global spread of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs); (ii) the role of biocides in triggering transient phenotypic adaptations in bacteria, including efflux pump overexpression, membrane alterations, and reduced porin expression, which often result in cross-resistance to multiple antibiotics; (iii) the capacity of biocides to disrupt bacteria and make the genetic content accessible, releasing DNA into the environment that remains intact under certain conditions, facilitating horizontal gene transfer and the spread of resistance determinants; (iv) the capacity of biocides to disrupt bacterial cells, releasing intact DNA into the environment and enhancing horizontal gene transfer of resistance determinants; and (iv) the selective interactions between biocides and bacterial biofilms in the environment, strengthening biofilm cohesion, inducing resistance mechanisms, and creating reservoirs for resistant microorganisms and ARG dissemination.

Recent research has revealed that in impaired skin tissues, FGF21 and its receptors are upregulated and play a significant role in accelerating the wound healing process. However, the clinical application of FGF21 is severely limited by its short   half-life: this factor is often degraded by enzymes before it can exert its therapeutic effects. To address this limitation, the transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) has emerged as an innovative approach that enables sustained drug release, significantly prolonging the therapeutic duration. Leveraging genetic recombination technology, research teams have ingeniously fused FGF21 with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to construct recombinant FGF21 complexes. These novel conjugates can efficiently penetrate the epidermal barrier and achieve sustained and stable pharmacological activity through TDDS. This review systematically analyzes the potential signaling pathways by which FGF21 accelerates skin wound repair, summarizes the latest advancements in TDDS technology, explores the therapeutic potential of FGF21, and evaluates the efficacy of CPP fusion tags. The manuscript not only proposes an innovative paradigm for the application of FGF21 in skin injury treatment but also provides new insights into its use in transdermal delivery, marking a significant step toward overcoming existing clinical therapeutic challenges.

We sought to understand the utilization and procedural safety of cardiac catheterization in pediatric patients on ECMO. We also aimed to understand differences in the types of interventions and outcomes in patients with single ventricle (SV) physiology compared to those with biventricular physiology. Characteristics and outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac catheterization while on ECMO were collected from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry: IMPACT (Improving Pediatric and Adult Congenital Treatment) Registry from 2011-2022. There were 3473 cardiac catheterizations performed on 2980 pediatric patients during the study period. Patients with SV comprised 31.6% of the population. Survival to hospital discharge was 53.2% overall, 45.2% in patients with SV, and 56.8% in patients with 2 ventricles. Interventional procedures occurred in 52.5% of cases. Major adverse events occurred in 11.5%, with arrhythmia, bleeding events, and unplanned cardiac/other surgeries being the commonest. Regression analysis found SV was significantly associated with major adverse events, as were interventional procedures, female sex, non-Hispanic race, diabetes mellitus, procedure status classified as salvage vs elective, and systemic heparinization. This is the first large, multicenter review of safety and outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac catheterization while on ECMO. The study identifies common adverse events during the procedure as well as risk factors associated with the same. The presented data can serve for benchmarking, quality assessment as well as potential future research.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who presented to an urban academic medical center ED for any indication and had elevated blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mm Hg and \u2264180/110 mm Hg). Eligible participants who were discharged from the ED were enrolled between February 12, 2019, and March 31, 2023, and were randomized to receive either usual care or the intervention with follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. Usual care involved standard hypertension discharge instructions with a referral for outpatient follow-up.

This cohort study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, collected CVH data for participants from 4 US centers from 1985 to 2020. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations of (1) cumulative LE8 score by quartile, (2) cumulative LE8 score and score at age 45 years, and (3) cumulative LE8 score and LE8 score slope from age 18 to 45 years with incident CVD and mortality after age 45 years.

All patients underwent definitive treatment consisting of irrigation and debridement, followed by immediate intramedullary nailing during the same anesthetic. Patients with type IIIB fractures who did not receive soft tissue coverage within 7 days of presentation, as well as those with type IIIC fractures were excluded. The primary outcome measure was the incidence of deep infection necessitating a return to the operating room. Time to surgery was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Time intervals to surgical debridement were categorized as follows: less than 6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18 hours, 18 to 24 hours, and greater than 24 hours. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether key factors, including age, diabetes, fracture type, smoking, ASA classification, and time to debridement at the previously categorized time points were predictive of infection.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and stroke. Rats in the stroke groups underwent photothrombosis-induced IS in the sensorimotor cortex area. They were divided into the following subgroups: treated with anti-CD20 after ischemia and killed after 5 and/or 10 days of IS. Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA levels of inflammation markers (VIM, ANXA3, SLC22 A4, and ADM), and also levels of transcription factors for Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets (Tbet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3, respectively), and also Foxp3 were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of ADM and SLC22 A4 increased following IS on the 5th and 10th days, while treatment with anti-CD20 reversed their levels. Anti-CD20 therapy attenuated inflammation through down-regulation of VIM and ANXA3 after 10 days. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the downregulation of Th1-Th17-driven inflammatory responses (Tbet and ROR\u03b3t) and the upregulation of Th2 activities (GATA- 3). In addition, anti-CD20 increased the expression of Foxp3. Anti-CD20 treatment can also reduce brain tissue damage after 10 days.

The study included 20,009 hospitalized HF and AKD patients who underwent dialysis during hospitalization, recovered from dialysis within 90 days after discharge, and were followed until November 30, 2022, using data from TriNetX. The study period began in July 2015, coinciding with the availability of ARNi in the market. Propensity score matching (1:1) was applied to balance ARNi and ACEi groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the risks of mortality, major adverse kidney events (MAKE), readmission and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The follow-up period was conducted with a maximum duration of 5 years. A total of 20,009 AKD patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.2] years) were enrolled, of whom 21.9% received ARNi, with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. After matching, 4391 patients (mean age, 58.6 years; male, 67.9%) were identified in both the ARNi and control groups. ARNi users exhibited a significantly lower risk of mortality (aHR, 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.80, p = 0.01), MAKE (aHR, 0.58, 95% CI 0.51-0.66, p < 0.01 ), and readmission (aHR, 0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.68, p <0.01) versus controls. However, no significant difference in the risk of MACE was observed between the two groups (aHR, 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.09, p = 0.78). Subgroup analysis revealed ARNi users, when concomitantly treated with mineralocorticoids, diuretics, or beta-blockers had significantly lower risks of mortality, readmission, and MAKE than the control group. In addition, ARNi significantly reduced mortality and MAKE in patients with GFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m , irrespective of proteinuria status. However, no significant benefit was observed in patients with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m . In HF patients with AKD, ARNi was associated with reduced all-cause mortality, MAKE, and readmission risks compared to ACEi, particularly with concurrent mineralocorticoids, diuretics, or beta-blockers. Future research is necessary to further investigate the impact of ARNi on outcomes in patients with HF and AKD.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Predictive models were constructed using machine learning algorithms, and tree-based feature selection was applied to evaluate the contributions of AKI and renal function indicators to mortality prediction. A total of 127 GPA patients were included in the analysis. Multivariate logistic regression identified AKI (OR\u2009>\u20091, P\u2009<\u20090.05) as a significant predictor of 1-year mortality.

Furthermore, both patient populations show increased risk of many communicable infectious diseases and their adverse consequences, while vaccination can play a crucial role in their prevention, improving patient outcomes. Vaccination should represent a standard part of care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and both the diseases simultaneously, including people undergoing cancer treatment or in remission. Several international guidelines provide recommendations for vaccinating people with cancer or diabetes, but the two conditions have not been specifically evaluated together. Here we present a multidisciplinary consensus position paper on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. The position paper is the result of a collaborative effort between experts from the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD), Italian Society of Diabetology (SID), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and Italian Society of Pharmacology (SIF). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art knowledge on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. It discusses the importance of vaccination in preventing infections, focuses attention on the need to consider the unique challenges faced by patients with cancer and diabetes when it comes to vaccine administration, and highlights the need for coordinated care to optimize treatment outcomes.

However, the mechanism by which this effect is produced is not completely clear. In this study, we explored the involvement of TRPV1 and the MOR-NMDAR complex in the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice with neuropathic pain. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by administering streptozotocin-nicotinamide. Four weeks later, once neuropathic pain was established, the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 (56.2\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using the up-down method with the von Frey filaments, both in the absence and the presence of capsazepine (8\u00a0mg/kg, ip), naloxone (NLX, 1\u00a0mg/kg, ip), NMDA (0.4 nM/10 \u00b5L, it), or their co-administration (NLX-NMDA). Gabapentin was used as positive control. Pretreatment with NLX did not alter the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in the up-down method with the von Frey filaments in hyperglycemic mice, whereas NMDA significantly reduced it. The addition of NLX to NMDA (NLX-NMDA) did not modify the effect of NMDA alone on the antiallodynic activity of LMH-2. Additionally, capsazepine completely blocked the antinociceptive effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice. Molecular docking analysis suggested a potential interaction between LMH-2 and TRPV1. Moreover, a higher dose of LMH-2 did not cause mortality or damage in healthy mice. These results suggest the potential utility of LMH-2 in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and highlight a key role for TRPV1 in LMH-2's antiallodynic mechanism, along with a possible, albeit limited, interaction with the MOR/NMDA complex.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Resistance and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics are continually on the rise, and vaccines remain in development. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on prophage contribution to the epidemiology of GBS isolates from humans in South America. In the context of an Argentinian multicentric study, we had previously phenotypically characterized 365 human GBS isolates from invasive disease, urinary infections and maternal colonization. These isolates had been whole-genome sequenced, and their prophage presence was bioinformatically determined. In this study, we genomically characterized the isolates and analysed the prophage content in the context of the epidemiological data. The phylogenetic analysis of the 365 genomes with 103 GBS from public databases revealed that Argentinian GBS were related to isolates from around the world. The most prevalent lineages, independent of the isolated source, were CC23/Ia and CC12/Ib. Genes encoding virulence factors involved in immune response evasion, tissue damage and adherence to host tissues, and invasion were found in all of the genomes in accordance with previously described lineage distribution. According to the prevalent capsular types and the distribution of specific virulence factors in Argentinian GBS, over 95% coverage would be expected from the vaccines currently under development. Antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) to at least one antibiotic class were found in 90% of the genomes, including novel mutations in  2x, while more than 15% carried ARDs to three or more classes. GBS collected from urinary infections carried a significantly higher proportion of ARDs to multiple antibiotic classes than the rest of the isolates. A total of 454 prophages were found among the 468 genomes analysed, which were classified into 23 prophage types. Prophage presence exhibited variations based on GBS clonal complex and capsular type. A possible association between an increased GBS pathogenicity and the carriage of prophages with integrase type GBS 8 and/or the presence of genes that encode the Phox Homology domain has been observed. The highest prevalence of prophages per genome was found in lineages CC17/III and CC19/III, while the lowest amount was observed in CC12/Ib. Overall, the highest density of prophages, virulence factors and ARDs determinants was found in CC19 isolates, mostly of capsular type III, independent of the isolates' source.

This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations. Distinguishing direct effects of changes in consumption from one drug to another from common but unrelated responses to external events remains a challenge, as there are many factors that can influence consumption. The findings provide a better understanding of the interdependencies in the consumption of the most commonly prescribed antibacterial drugs, improving the understanding of potential influencing factors to support strategies for rational prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

Ninety-five patients with glaucoma underwent Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and driving simulations every 6 months. Rates of VF loss were estimated by changes in mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular VF over time. Driving performance was assessed using a simulator by maintaining lane position on a winding road while responding to peripheral visual stimuli to assess divided attention. Reaction time (RT) recorded the duration between the presentation of the stimuli and the participant's response. Linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes in SAP MS and mean RT. Multivariable linear regression models were used to predict driving performance, adjusting for age, cognitive impairment, and driving exposure. Progressive VF loss was associated with a longitudinal increase in mean RT to the divided attention task.

This study aimed to develop a mathematical model to represent the anatomical localization and functional organization of the insula, drawing on current neuroimaging findings and established anatomical data. A three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid model was constructed to mathematically represent the anatomical boundaries of the insula using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate data. This geometric model adapts the ellipsoid equation to reflect the spatial configuration of the insula and is primarily based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and anatomical literature. Relevant findings from prior imaging research, particularly those reporting microstructural variations across insular subdivisions, were reviewed and conceptually integrated to guide the model's structural assumptions and interpretation of potential applications. The ellipsoid-based 3D model accurately represented the anatomical dimensions and spatial localization of the right insula, centered at the MNI coordinates (40, 5, 5\u00a0mm), and matched well with the known volumetric data. Functional regions (face, hand, and foot) were successfully plotted within the model, and statistical analysis confirmed significant differences along the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively). Dynamic simulations revealed oscillatory patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neural activity, consistent with established insular neurophysiology. Additionally, connectivity modeling demonstrated strong bidirectional interactions between the insula and key regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), reflecting its integrative role in brain networks.

When immature, they take up and process antigens efficiently. When mature, they express high levels of MHC class I and II molecules and costimulatory molecules on their surface and secrete both IL-12 and IL-15 that can activate and steer T cells. However, in patients with cancer or tumor-bearing animals, cancers secrete cytokines that suppress DC development or maturation. To circumvent this barrier to immunization against cancer, strategies have been developed to grow and mature DCs ex vivo from precursors, such as peripheral blood monocytes or bone marrow precursors, induce expression of tumor antigens ex vivo, and then administer the autologous DCs to the patient as a vaccine. The DCs may be coated with synthetic antigenic peptides or transduced with a virus expressing the tumor antigen (see Note 1). Both of these have been used in early clinical trials with promising immunogenicity. Such cancer vaccines may be especially critical for \"cold\" tumors that do not induce a sufficient immune response by themselves to be amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy or blockade of other negative regulators of immunity but with a cancer vaccine to induce the immune response, may become responsive to such immunotherapies. Conversely, cancer vaccines should become more effective if immunosuppressive mechanisms are blocked. Thus, the two approaches should synergize to optimize anticancer immune responses and reject the cancer like an allogeneic organ transplant.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"}

However, little is known about the variation in outcomes for patients with DFUs according to the health care facilities treating them. To examine facility-level variation in major leg amputation among veterans with incident DFUs using the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) cohort. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2021, of all veterans with a new diagnosis of DFU at 140 VHA facilities across the US. Patients were followed up to 1 year from DFU diagnosis. Analyses were conducted between March 22, 2024, and January 13, 2025. A facility was assigned to each patient corresponding to the health care site where the initial DFU diagnosis was made. The primary outcome was major leg amputation during the follow-up period. A multivariable mixed-effects regression model with random facility intercepts was applied to assess variation in major leg amputation rates across facilities, adjusting for social drivers of health, comorbidities, and complicated DFU at initial diagnosis. The median odds ratio (MOR) was calculated to quantify facility-level variation in outcomes. A total of 86\u202f094 veterans (98.3% male; mean [SD] age, 73.0 [8.1] years; age range, 55-102 years) were included. Major leg amputation was performed for 3279 veterans (3.8%) within a year of DFU diagnosis. The MOR for facility-level variation in major leg amputation was 1.85, indicating that the odds of major leg amputation were 1.85 times higher between 2 randomly selected facilities for an average patient (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

A total of 393 patients (306 males) with a mean age of 38 years (range 15-87 years) were included. Of these, 24 patients (6%) had diabetes and 126 patients (32%) were smokers. There were 78 (20%) type I fractures, 170 (43%) type II fractures, and 144 (37%) type III fractures. Of the type III fractures, 99 (68%) were type IIIA while 45 (32%) were type IIIB. A total of 32 patients (8%) were treated within 6 hours, 111 patients (28%) between 6 and 12 hours, 131 patients (33%) between 12 and 18 hours, 69 patients (18%) between 18 and 24 hours, and 50 patients (13%) after 24 hours. A total of 46 infections (12.5%) were observed: 6 infections (13%) in type I fractures, 14 infections (20%) in type II fractures, 10 infections (22%) in type IIIA fractures, and 16 infections (35%) in type IIIB fractures. Time to surgery was not predictive of infection (p=0.31). Logistic regression analysis showed that patients with a type IIIB fracture were 6.1 times more likely to develop an infection compared to other fracture types (OR = 6.147, 95% CI: 1.975- 19.129, p = 0.002). Smokers were 2.8 times more likely to develop an infection (OR = 2.779, 95% CI: 1.357-5.691, P = 0.005). Age, time to debridement at the specified time points, diabetes, and ASA classification did not significantly predict infection (p = 0.32, 0.31, 0.27, and 0.50, respectively). Smoking and type IIIB fractures were identified as significant predictors of infection following immediate medullary nailing of open tibial shaft fractures, whereas time to debridement, within the categorized time points, was not found to be a significant factor.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Furthermore, both patient populations show increased risk of many communicable infectious diseases and their adverse consequences, while vaccination can play a crucial role in their prevention, improving patient outcomes. Vaccination should represent a standard part of care for patients with cancer, diabetes, and both the diseases simultaneously, including people undergoing cancer treatment or in remission. Several international guidelines provide recommendations for vaccinating people with cancer or diabetes, but the two conditions have not been specifically evaluated together. Here we present a multidisciplinary consensus position paper on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. The position paper is the result of a collaborative effort between experts from the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM), Italian Association of Medical Diabetologists (AMD), Italian Society of Diabetology (SID), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and Italian Society of Pharmacology (SIF). The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art knowledge on vaccination in patients with cancer and diabetes. It discusses the importance of vaccination in preventing infections, focuses attention on the need to consider the unique challenges faced by patients with cancer and diabetes when it comes to vaccine administration, and highlights the need for coordinated care to optimize treatment outcomes.

When immature, they take up and process antigens efficiently. When mature, they express high levels of MHC class I and II molecules and costimulatory molecules on their surface and secrete both IL-12 and IL-15 that can activate and steer T cells. However, in patients with cancer or tumor-bearing animals, cancers secrete cytokines that suppress DC development or maturation. To circumvent this barrier to immunization against cancer, strategies have been developed to grow and mature DCs ex vivo from precursors, such as peripheral blood monocytes or bone marrow precursors, induce expression of tumor antigens ex vivo, and then administer the autologous DCs to the patient as a vaccine. The DCs may be coated with synthetic antigenic peptides or transduced with a virus expressing the tumor antigen (see Note 1). Both of these have been used in early clinical trials with promising immunogenicity. Such cancer vaccines may be especially critical for \"cold\" tumors that do not induce a sufficient immune response by themselves to be amenable to checkpoint inhibitor therapy or blockade of other negative regulators of immunity but with a cancer vaccine to induce the immune response, may become responsive to such immunotherapies. Conversely, cancer vaccines should become more effective if immunosuppressive mechanisms are blocked. Thus, the two approaches should synergize to optimize anticancer immune responses and reject the cancer like an allogeneic organ transplant.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"},

However, the mechanism by which this effect is produced is not completely clear. In this study, we explored the involvement of TRPV1 and the MOR-NMDAR complex in the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice with neuropathic pain. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by administering streptozotocin-nicotinamide. Four weeks later, once neuropathic pain was established, the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 (56.2\u00a0mg/kg) was evaluated using the up-down method with the von Frey filaments, both in the absence and the presence of capsazepine (8\u00a0mg/kg, ip), naloxone (NLX, 1\u00a0mg/kg, ip), NMDA (0.4 nM/10 \u00b5L, it), or their co-administration (NLX-NMDA). Gabapentin was used as positive control. Pretreatment with NLX did not alter the antiallodynic effect of LMH-2 in the up-down method with the von Frey filaments in hyperglycemic mice, whereas NMDA significantly reduced it. The addition of NLX to NMDA (NLX-NMDA) did not modify the effect of NMDA alone on the antiallodynic activity of LMH-2. Additionally, capsazepine completely blocked the antinociceptive effect of LMH-2 in hyperglycemic mice. Molecular docking analysis suggested a potential interaction between LMH-2 and TRPV1. Moreover, a higher dose of LMH-2 did not cause mortality or damage in healthy mice.

Stem cell therapy aims to repair damaged tissue and restore vision. The present review focuses on the advancements in stem cell therapies for ocular disorders, their mechanism of action, and clinical applications while addressing some outstanding challenges. Stem cells that include embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and retinal progenitor cells have regenerative potential for ocular repair. They differentiate into specialized ocular cell types, conduct neuroprotection, and modulate immune responses. It is emphasized in preclinical and clinical studies that stem cell therapy can treat corneal disorders such as limbal stem cell deficiency, retinal diseases like dry age macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, and diabetic retinopathy. Various studies suggested that stem cells have considerable scope in glaucoma treatment by supporting retinal ganglion cell survival and optic nerve regeneration. Advanced approaches such as gene editing, organoid generation, and artificial intelligence enhance these therapies. Effective delivery to target areas, engraftment, orientation, and long-term survival of transplanted cells need optimization. Issues such as immune rejection and tumorigenicity must be addressed. This approach is further hindered by regulatory issues and overly complicated approval processes and trials. Ethical issues related to sourcing embryonic stem cells and patient consent complicate the issue. The cost of manufacturing stem cells and their accessibility are other factors posing potential barriers to widespread application. These regulatory, ethical, and economic issues must be tackled if stem cell treatments are to be made safe, accessible, and effective. Future studies will include refining therapeutic protocols, scaling manufacturing processes, and overcoming socio-economic barriers, eventually improving clinical outcomes.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

Resistance and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics are continually on the rise, and vaccines remain in development. Prophages have been reported to contribute to GBS evolution and pathogenicity. However, no studies are available to date on prophage contribution to the epidemiology of GBS isolates from humans in South America. In the context of an Argentinian multicentric study, we had previously phenotypically characterized 365 human GBS isolates from invasive disease, urinary infections and maternal colonization. These isolates had been whole-genome sequenced, and their prophage presence was bioinformatically determined. In this study, we genomically characterized the isolates and analysed the prophage content in the context of the epidemiological data. The phylogenetic analysis of the 365 genomes with 103 GBS from public databases revealed that Argentinian GBS were related to isolates from around the world. The most prevalent lineages, independent of the isolated source, were CC23/Ia and CC12/Ib. Genes encoding virulence factors involved in immune response evasion, tissue damage and adherence to host tissues, and invasion were found in all of the genomes in accordance with previously described lineage distribution. According to the prevalent capsular types and the distribution of specific virulence factors in Argentinian GBS, over 95% coverage would be expected from the vaccines currently under development. Antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs) to at least one antibiotic class were found in 90% of the genomes, including novel mutations in  2x, while more than 15% carried ARDs to three or more classes. GBS collected from urinary infections carried a significantly higher proportion of ARDs to multiple antibiotic classes than the rest of the isolates. A total of 454 prophages were found among the 468 genomes analysed, which were classified into 23 prophage types. Prophage presence exhibited variations based on GBS clonal complex and capsular type. A possible association between an increased GBS pathogenicity and the carriage of prophages with integrase type GBS 8 and/or the presence of genes that encode the Phox Homology domain has been observed. The highest prevalence of prophages per genome was found in lineages CC17/III and CC19/III, while the lowest amount was observed in CC12/Ib. Overall, the highest density of prophages, virulence factors and ARDs determinants was found in CC19 isolates, mostly of capsular type III, independent of the isolates' source.

This study examines the relationships among the 15 most prescribed antibacterial substances in Germany, analysing the correlations and trends of prescribed defined daily dose (DDD) of antibacterial drugs within the outpatient care sector under statutory health insurance from 1986 to 2022. Three groups of drugs with similar consumption trajectories were identified. The first group, including doxycycline, phenoxymethylpenicillin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, showed declining trends with stable trajectories, its similarities being confirmed by overlapping indications such as respiratory tract infections and declining usage due to guideline changes. The second group, comprising amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpodoxime and pivmecillinam, displayed increasing trends with continuous trajectories. The third group, including ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin and cefaclor, shared declining trends with fluctuating trajectories, often related to bacterial resistance rates and substitution by other antibacterial drugs. Frequently prescribed substances often show many and strong correlations in consumption, indicating that they are more related with other substances and being susceptible to external factors, such as changes in costs, sudden events like the COVID pandemic or guideline recommendations. Less commonly used medicines, typically for niche indications, tend to have a more stable consumption trend and being less influenced by broader trends, resulting in fewer significant correlations.

Fimbriae are important virulence factors involved in biofilm formation and adhesion to host cells. Their exposed location, conservation among clinical isolates and adjuvant properties make them interesting candidates for inclusion in protein-based vaccines. Therefore, the present work investigated the immunological potential of type 1 and 3 fimbriae subunits in a murine model of   lung infection. MrkA and FimA were produced as recombinant proteins in  , purified and used to immunize mice subcutaneously. The immune responses were characterized and protection against pneumonia was evaluated after intranasal challenge. Subcutaneous immunization with recombinant FimA and MrkA induced high IgG1 production; the antibodies efficiently recognized the native proteins at the bacterial surface, promoted C3 deposition and reduced biofilm formation by   in vitro. Mice vaccinated with the co-administered proteins reduced the bacterial loads in the lungs after intranasal challenge, less inflammation and reduced tissue damage.

Ninety-five patients with glaucoma underwent Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP) and driving simulations every 6 months. Rates of VF loss were estimated by changes in mean sensitivity (MS) of the integrated binocular VF over time. Driving performance was assessed using a simulator by maintaining lane position on a winding road while responding to peripheral visual stimuli to assess divided attention. Reaction time (RT) recorded the duration between the presentation of the stimuli and the participant's response. Linear mixed models evaluated longitudinal changes in SAP MS and mean RT. Multivariable linear regression models were used to predict driving performance, adjusting for age, cognitive impairment, and driving exposure. Progressive VF loss was associated with a longitudinal increase in mean RT to the divided attention task. In the multivariable model, each 1 decibel (dB)/year faster loss of integrated binocular MS was associated with a 0.024 logarithms (ln) s/year increase in mean RT (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.007 to 0.042, P = 0.008).

Although several studies have described its anatomical and functional characteristics, mathematical models that quantitatively represent the insula's complex structure and connectivity are lacking. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model to represent the anatomical localization and functional organization of the insula, drawing on current neuroimaging findings and established anatomical data. A three-dimensional (3D) ellipsoid model was constructed to mathematically represent the anatomical boundaries of the insula using Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate data. This geometric model adapts the ellipsoid equation to reflect the spatial configuration of the insula and is primarily based on cytoarchitectonic mapping and anatomical literature. Relevant findings from prior imaging research, particularly those reporting microstructural variations across insular subdivisions, were reviewed and conceptually integrated to guide the model's structural assumptions and interpretation of potential applications. The ellipsoid-based 3D model accurately represented the anatomical dimensions and spatial localization of the right insula, centered at the MNI coordinates (40, 5, 5\u00a0mm), and matched well with the known volumetric data. Functional regions (face, hand, and foot) were successfully plotted within the model, and statistical analysis confirmed significant differences along the anteroposterior and superoinferior axes (p\u2009<\u20090.01 and p\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively).

Emergency department (ED) visits serve as critical access points within health care and present a unique opportunity for hypertension screening and intervention. To evaluate the effectiveness of an Education and mHealth Empowerment (E2) intervention compared with usual care in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP) among patients with elevated BP discharged from the ED. This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants who presented to an urban academic medical center ED for any indication and had elevated blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mm Hg and \u2264180/110 mm Hg). Eligible participants who were discharged from the ED were enrolled between February 12, 2019, and March 31, 2023, and were randomized to receive either usual care or the intervention with follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. Usual care involved standard hypertension discharge instructions with a referral for outpatient follow-up. The E2 intervention involved a 3-prong approach, which included a brief Post-Acute Care Hypertension consultation (PACHT-c) with a clinical pharmacist or an advanced practice nurse, a smartphone-enabled BP monitoring kit (Withings device and mobile app) for daily self-monitoring along with behavior change text messages, and primary care referral. The primary outcome was the mean change in SBP (mm Hg) from baseline to 6 months. Of the 574 participants enrolled, mean (SD) age was 51.1 (12.5) years, and 323 (56%) were female; 413 were Black (72%), 115 were Hispanic or Latino (20%), 27 were White (5%), and 19 were other race and ethnicity (3%), which included Asian, American Indian, and other racial or ethnic groups. Of the 413 patients with BP data at 6 months, the E2 intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009210) showed a greater mean reduction in SBP (mean difference, 4.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.8-9.0 mm Hg; P\u2009=\u2009.02) compared with the usual-care group (n\u2009=\u2009203).

To determine whether cumulative CVH, as measured by the American Heart Association Life's Essential 8 (LE8) from age 18 to 45 years, is associated with incident CVD and mortality in midlife. This cohort study, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, collected CVH data for participants from 4 US centers from 1985 to 2020. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models assessed the associations of (1) cumulative LE8 score by quartile, (2) cumulative LE8 score and score at age 45 years, and (3) cumulative LE8 score and LE8 score slope from age 18 to 45 years with incident CVD and mortality after age 45 years.

Participants underwent same-day quantitative contrast sensitivity function (qCSF) and 6 \u00d7 6 mm OCT angiography (OCTA) centered on the optic disc.

Mixed-effects multivariable regression models, controlling for age, hypertension, and lens status, evaluated associations between RPC OCTA metrics, DR severity, VA, and qCSF. Significant RPC microvascular changes were observed across DR stages. Capillary perfusion density decreased with DR severity and even before retinopathy onset in DMnoDR versus controls (\u03b2avg = -0.42, P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).

Anti-CD20 treatments have a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Here, we investigated the effect of anti-CD20 on IS-induced inflammation and histopathologic changes in the rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control, sham, and stroke. Rats in the stroke groups underwent photothrombosis-induced IS in the sensorimotor cortex area. They were divided into the following subgroups: treated with anti-CD20 after ischemia and killed after 5 and/or 10 days of IS. Histological changes were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. mRNA levels of inflammation markers (VIM, ANXA3, SLC22 A4, and ADM), and also levels of transcription factors for Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets (Tbet, GATA3, and ROR-\u03b3, respectively), and also Foxp3 were detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The levels of ADM and SLC22 A4 increased following IS on the 5th and 10th days, while treatment with anti-CD20 reversed their levels. Anti-CD20 therapy attenuated inflammation through down-regulation of VIM and ANXA3 after 10 days. This therapeutic effect was mainly mediated by the downregulation of Th1-Th17-driven inflammatory responses (Tbet and ROR\u03b3t) and the upregulation of Th2 activities (GATA- 3). In addition, anti-CD20 increased the expression of Foxp3. Anti-CD20 treatment can also reduce brain tissue damage after 10 days.

This study aimed to explore the role and underlying mechanisms of the 5-methylcytosine (m C) RNA methyltransferase NOL1/NOP2/SUN domain (NSUN)2 in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). To assess cell viability and death, we employed Cell Counting Kit-8 and propidium iodide staining. Ferroptosis-related markers were evaluated using commercial kits and Western blot analysis. The m C levels of ferroptosis-associated mRNAs were quantified by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR. The specific m C sites on the transferrin receptor (TFRC) mRNA were identified through a dual-luciferase reporter assay, while the interaction between NSUN2 and TFRC was investigated using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). The role of SHK   was explored using a xenografted tumor model. Our findings revealed that SHK significantly reduced cell viability and induced cell death and ferroptosis in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Notably, SHK treatment led to an upregulation of NSUN2 expression. Inhibition of NSUN2 reversed the effects of SHK, restoring cell viability and reducing cell death and ferroptosis. Mechanistically, NSUN2 enhanced TFRC expression via m C-dependent methylation. Overexpression of NSUN2 similarly decreased cell viability and increased cell death and ferroptosis, effects that were mitigated upon silencing of TFRC.  , SHK treatment effectively suppressed tumor growth in xenografted mice. In summary, our study demonstrated that SHK promoted cell death and ferroptosis in AML by modulating NSUN2-mediated m C methylation of TFRC.

RGC degeneration is the root cause of a variety of blinding diseases linked to optic nerve damage, including glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. The underlying cellular mechanisms of RGC degeneration are largely unclear; yet, they have been connected to excessive production of the signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which subsequently produces the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This, in turn, activates protein kinase G (PKG), which can phosphorylate downstream protein targets. To study the role of NO/cGMP/PKG signalling in RGC degeneration, we used organotypic retinal explant cultures in which the optic nerve had been severed. We assessed the activity of NOS, RGC death and survival at different times after optic nerve transection. While NOS activity was high right after optic nerve transection, significant RGC loss occurred with a 24-48-h delay. We then treated retinal explants with inhibitors selectively targeting either NOS, sGC, PKG, or Kv1.3 and Kv1.6 voltage-gated potassium channels. While all four treatments reduced RGC death, the PKG inhibitor CN238 and the Kv-channel blocker Margatoxin (MrgX) showed the most pronounced rescue effects. Our results confirm an involvement of NO/cGMP/PKG signalling in RGC degeneration, highlight the potential of PKG and Kv1-channel targeting drugs for treatment development, and further suggest organotypic retinal explant cultures as a useful model for investigations into optic nerve damage.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

A three-year-old boy with global developmental delay, was referred for evaluation of rapid weight gain over the preceding three months, accompanied by increased body hair, a moon-shaped face, and sleep disturbances. Biochemical testing revealed undetectable ACTH levels and elevated cortisol levels, leading to the diagnosis of ACTH-independent CS. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated adrenal asymmetry, with a larger left adrenal gland, and further investigation using PET scan excluded the presence of adrenal adenomas/carcinomas. The patient was initially treated with metyrapone, which effectively reduced cortisol levels. However, after two months, a left adrenalectomy was performed. Pathological examination confirmed micronodular non-pigmented adrenal hyperplasia. One year later, cortisol levels increased again with undetectable ACTH, prompting the re-initiation of metyrapone. Due to intolerance to this medication, osilodrostat, an off-label treatment, was introduced. At the time of follow-up, 15\u00a0months after initiation of osilodrostat, both serum and urinary cortisol levels remained within normal ranges, ACTH levels remained undetectable, and the clinical symptoms of CS were well controlled. This case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with rare pediatric cases of ACTH-independent CS. The treatment course, which included metyrapone, adrenalectomy, and off-label use of osilodrostat, resulted in significant improvement in cortisol control and clinical symptoms. Ongoing genetic analysis is being conducted to explore potential underlying genetic factors contributing to the patient's non-pigmented micronodular adrenal hyperplasia and developmental delay.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

MO can cause irreversible tissue damage and permanent visual impairment. Dexamethasone implant is approved for intravitreal injection (IV) in the treatment of MO. Despite its proven efficacy, IV poses risks of complications. Recently, suprachoroidal injection has emerged as a novel strategy for targeted drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye, reducing the risk of complications.Case presentationA 70-year-old woman with no history of diabetes underwent left eye cataract surgery complicated by a capsular rupture and vitreous prolapse, which resulted in the patient becoming aphakic. Later, ophthalmic examination revealed a cystoid MO secondary to a posterior postoperative NIU. Since IV injection of triamcinolone had minimal visual benefit and due to the contraindication of IV cortisone implants, a dexamethasone implant was injected via the suprachoroidal injection, with additional intravitreal triamcinolone. Functional and anatomical recovery was observed after the procedure, with improved visual acuity and no ocular hypertension.ConclusionOur study describes a successful case of dexamethasone implant administered via suprachoroidal space, with no complications and a possible increased effectiveness when compared with intravitreal triamcinolone.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "diabetes treatment"},

One such therapy is self-administered, intramuscular injections of paraffin oil for the purpose of increasing presumed muscular size. Paraffin oil injections are becoming frequent among younger male individuals, who inject up to several liters in (primarily) the upper extremities. However, paraffin oil leads to the formation of granulomas, which are rich in macrophages with an upregulated extrarenal 1-hydroxylation. These macrophages will rapidly and unimpededly convert inactive vitamin D (25OHD ) to active vitamin D (1,25OH D ), thereby causing significant hypercalcemia and derivative disease. In 2007, a Scandinavian male individual in his 20s had self-injected 1200\u00a0ml of paraffin oil into both biceps. Within 5\u00a0years, the oil had migrated and was then widely dispersed in his biceps and surrounding tissues, causing swelling and pain. By 2015, granulomas had formed at injection sites, and he was admitted to a hospital with severe hypercalcemia, which was managed with fluid therapy and slowly resolved. From 2015 to 2020, his calcium levels were intermittently elevated, and he experienced two episodes of nephrolithiasis requiring surgical intervention.

We aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the systematic review (SRs) of berberine for the treatment of diverse conditions. A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed was performed from the database inception to April 11, 2024. SRs on berberine were included and evaluated. The methodological quality and the reporting quality of each SR were assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool and PRISMA checklist, respectively. The quality of evidence was appraised based on the GRADE. Fifty-four SRs were included and analyzed. Overall, associations were found between berberine and 70 health outcomes concerned with 9 diseases. Berberine has improved most outcomes of these diseases: 78% (25/32) cardiovascular disease outcomes, 92.59% (25/27) type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes, 94.74% (18/19) gastrointestinal disorders outcomes, 72.22% (13/18) polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) outcomes, 86.67% (13/15) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) outcomes, 92.31% (12/13) schizophrenia outcomes, 90.91% (10/11) metabolic syndrome outcomes, 57.14% (4/7) obesity outcomes, and 100.00% (6/6) dyslipidemia outcomes. There was a high overlap of primary studies (CCA\u2009>\u200915%) in the SRs of PCOS, NAFLD, obesity, and schizophrenia.

This study was part of the Strong Mama research project, which was carried out in Oslo, Norway, between October 2022 and February 2024. Sixty athletes (10 elite and 50 recreational) participated in the study. They completed an online survey during late pregnancy and participated in a structured telephone interview six weeks postpartum. The survey and interview collected data on exercise habits, pregnancy experiences, and maternal and neonatal health outcomes. The athletes maintained high exercise levels during pregnancy, with elite athletes exercising an average of 11.6\u00a0h per week (SD 3.2) and recreational athletes exercising 7.0\u00a0h per week (SD 2.4). Most athletes resumed exercising within six weeks postpartum. Almost all pregnancies were planned, including six which involved fertility treatment. Most women (76.7%) had spontaneous onset of labor and vaginal deliveries to term (between 36 and 42 weeks). The mean birthweight was 3487 (SD 519.4, range 2600-4775) grams. Two of the elite athletes were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus and two with hypertension during pregnancy. None of the 50 recreational athletes reported any pregnancy complications.

However, less is known about the association between psychiatric symptoms and PA behaviour in trauma-exposed adults. Most prior investigations have focused on independent associations between overall depression or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to PA and have neglected specific symptom domains (e.g. anhedonia). Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses on a parent dataset to examine whether PTSD symptom severity moderates the association between anhedonia and PA volume.  Trauma-exposed adults ( \u2009=\u2009107, 61% women, M\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD age\u2009=\u200928\u2009\u00b1\u20099 y 54% White) completed questionnaires assessing demographic information, anhedonia, PTSD symptom severity (overall and symptom clusters), and PA volume (total MET-min/week). Main effects and interactions between anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity in relation to PA volume were examined with robust linear regression models.  We observed a significant anhedonia\u2009\u00d7\u2009PTSD symptom severity interaction. An inverse association between anhedonia and PA volume was observed among adults with lower-to-moderate PTSD symptom severity, and a positive association between anhedonia and PA volume was observed among adults with higher PTSD symptom severity. Significant anhedonia\u2009\u00d7\u2009PTSD symptom severity interactions for avoidance (Cluster C) and negative alterations in arousal/reactivity (Cluster E) symptoms were also observed, with associations in the same direction as the overall PTSD symptom severity model.  These preliminary findings suggest that co-occurring anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity profiles interact to influence PA volume in trauma-exposed adults. Future research is needed to understand why trauma-exposed adults with greater co-occurring anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity profiles reported engaging in higher levels of PA compared to those with lower symptom severity profiles. Such knowledge could help healthcare practitioners tailor treatment plans to incorporate or adjust PA prescriptions. This study contributes to an emerging area of research aimed at understanding the relationship between comorbid psychiatric symptoms and physical activity (PA) behaviours in trauma-exposed adults.Greater anhedonia was associated with lower PA among adults with lower-to-moderate PTSD symptom severity. Greater anhedonia was associated with higher PA among adults with higher PTSD symptom severity.Trauma-exposed adults with greater anhedonia and PTSD symptom severity may engage in high levels of PA as a coping or emotional regulation strategy (e.g. to combat high symptom burden, avoid hyperarousal symptoms, or compensate for loss of interest in some other previously enjoyable activity).", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

Timely diagnosis remains challenging due to the slow progression of symptoms and limited accessibility to advanced diagnostic tools, yet it remains one of the few tools available to prevent and alter the clinical course of the disease. The aim of this study is to build a cost-of-illness model to estimate the number of AD patients managed by the National Health Service, analyzing their use of hospital care, and estimating the social costs through real-world data. The analysis encompassed a multifaceted approach, combining real-world data analysis from different sources for the period 2014-2019. Health direct costs related to AD in Italy were estimated thanks to the Italian database of all hospital discharges and a Local Health Unit database (400,000 residents) collecting all information on resource consumption related to AD. The National Social Security System database was used to estimate social security costs (disability compensations) related to Attendance Allowance (AA) recognitions. In Italy a prevalence of 413,715 AD patients was estimated, with annual health direct costs per patient equal to \u20ac3,779. Annual social security costs related to AA recognitions amounted to 240\u00a0million euros. Overall, the analysis estimated an annual total cost exceeding 1.8\u00a0billion euros. This study provides a comprehensive exploration of the multifaceted burden of AD in Italy, shedding light on its economic dimensions. The results underscore the urgency of prioritizing AD on political agendas, especially in the face of the projected global surge in AD cases. The study advocates for proactive policy interventions and informed healthcare decision-making to address the complex challenges posed by AD.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

Nowadays, nano-formulations, particularly carbon dots, have emerged as promising candidates for targeting and treating brain diseases. In this study, we report the synthesis of a novel carbon dots, PTX-CDs, using a one-step hydrothermal method with paclitaxel (PTX) as the precursor. PTX-CDs shows increased water solubility by about 1000 times in comparison with PTX. Moreover, PTX-CDs effectively penetrates the BBB and exerts significant anticancer effects. In detail, PTX-CDs accumulates in mitochondria of tumor cells without adding extra targeted molecules, resulting in the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Transcriptome profiling revealed that PTX-CDs disturbs the cell-cycle by inducing arrest at the G2/M phase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. PTX-CDs further decreased cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in glioblastoma cells. PTX-CDs significantly inhibited the growth of intracranial tumors in orthotopic glioblastoma mice model and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

Despite this burden, efforts to forecast WNV disease to inform public health measures to reduce disease incidence have had limited success. Here, we analyze forecasts submitted to the 2022 WNV Forecasting Challenge, a follow-up to the 2020 WNV Forecasting Challenge. Forecasting teams submitted probabilistic forecasts of annual West Nile virus neuroinvasive disease (WNND) cases for each county in the continental USA for the 2022 WNV season. We assessed the skill of team-specific forecasts, baseline forecasts, and an ensemble created from team-specific forecasts. We then characterized the impact of model characteristics and county-specific contextual factors (e.g., population) on forecast skill. Ensemble forecasts for 2022 anticipated a season at or below median long-term WNND incidence for nearly all (>\u200999%) counties. More counties reported higher case numbers than anticipated by the ensemble forecast median, but national caseload (826) was well below the 10-year median (1386). Forecast skill was highest for the ensemble forecast, though the historical negative binomial baseline model and several team-submitted forecasts had similar forecast skill. Forecasts utilizing regression-based frameworks tended to have more skill than those that did not and models using climate, mosquito surveillance, demographic, or avian data had less skill than those that did not, potentially due to overfitting. County-contextual analysis showed strong relationships with the number of years that WNND had been reported and permutation entropy (historical variability). Evaluations based on weighted interval score and logarithmic scoring metrics produced similar results. The relative success of the ensemble forecast, the best forecast for 2022, suggests potential gains in community ability to forecast WNV, an improvement from the 2020 Challenge. Similar to the previous challenge, however, our results indicate that skill was still limited with general underprediction despite a relative low incidence year. Potential opportunities for improvement include refining mechanistic approaches, integrating additional data sources, and considering different approaches for areas with and without previous cases.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "neurological disorders"},

Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising tool for UL rehabilitation, offering immersive and engaging environments for motor recovery. However, the effectiveness of VR, its integration with conventional therapy, and their efficacy across different stroke recovery stages remain unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-based UL interventions in improving ADL and QoL among stroke survivors. This study adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023426256). A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Inclusion criteria focused on studies using immersive VR (IVR) and non-immersive VR (NIVR) interventions to assess ADL and QoL in stroke survivors. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers using the PEDro scale to assess quality. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the efficacy. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare IVR and NIVR, VR combined with conventional therapy versus standalone VR, and potential differences between stroke recovery stages. Thirty RCTs, representing 1,661 participants, were included. Overall, VR interventions significantly improved ADL (SMD\u2009=\u20090.27, 95% CI [0.11; 0.43], p\u2009<\u20090.001) and QoL (SMD\u2009=\u20090.94 [0.09; 1.79], p\u2009=\u20090.035) compared to conventional therapy.

Most drug resistance arises from the accumulation of genetic mutations in a minority of resistant cells. The mechanisms underlying the emergence and progression of cancer resistance from these minority-resistant cells (MRCs) remain poorly understood. This study employs force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) alongside various biological investigations to reveal the mechanical pathways for MRCs fostering drug resistance and tumor progression. The findings show that minority Paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells have enhanced mechanical properties. These cells can transmit high-intensity forces to surrounding sensitive cells (SCs) through the force transducer, Merlin. This force transmission facilitates the assimilation of surrounding SCs, subsequently strengthening the contraction and adhesion of tumor cells. This process is termed \"mechano-assimilation,\" which accelerates the development of drug resistance and tumor progression. Interestingly, disturbances and reductions of mechano-assimilation within tumors can restore sensitivity to Paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting the contribution of MRCs to the development of drug resistance and malignancy, mediated through mechanical interactions. It also establishes a foundation for future research focused on integrating mechanical factors into innovative cancer therapies.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cancer therapy"},

Sustained release of glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) within these conjugates continuously enhances T-cell endurance and potency by promoting memory differentiation and elevating crucial adhesion and motility genes. Concurrently, PD-L1 blocking peptides liberate T cells from immunosuppression, assisting T cells with precision toward tumor sites. This dual-targeting strategy-T cells directed at tumor antigens and peptides at PD-L1- enriches the tumor microenvironment with potent therapeutics, amplifying T cell-driven tumor destruction.

The protocells are assembled via electrostatically-driven self-assembly of \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD)-modified amino-dextran on a sacrificial template encapsulating glucose oxidase (GOx). To enable specific cancer cell targeting and catalytic activity, cell-targeting ligands (arginylglycylaspartic acid, cRGD) and catalase-like platinum-gold nanoparticles (Pt-AuNPs) are introduced through host-guest interactions, forming a fully functional, cell-targeting, bio-catalytic killer protocell.

Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of lung tissue from post-LTx patients was performed, and lung IRI was evaluated in C57BL/6 (WT), formyl peptide receptor 2 knockout (Fpr2 ) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 knockout (Nrf2 ) mice using a hilar-ligation model with or without LxA  administration. Furthermore, the protective efficacy of LxA  was evaluated employing a murine orthotopic LTx model and in\u00a0vitro studies using alveolar type II epithelial (ATII) cells. The results show differential expression of ferroptosis-related genes in post-LTx patient samples compared to healthy controls. A significant increase in the levels of oxidized lipids and a reduction in the levels of intact lipids were observed in mice subjected to IRI compared to shams. Importantly, LxA  treatment attenuated pulmonary dysfunction, ferroptosis, and inflammation in WT mice subjected to lung IRI, but not in Fpr2  or Nrf2  mice after IRI. In the murine LTx model, LxA  treatment increased PaO  levels and attenuated lung IRI. Mechanistically, LxA -mediated protection involves an increase in NRF2 activation and glutathione concentration as well as a decrease in MDA levels in ATII cells. In summary, our results collectively show that LxA /FPR2 signaling on ATII cells mitigates ferroptosis via NRF2 activation and protects against lung IRI.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Unfortunately, suitable animal models to study cardiac dysfunction caused by fatigue are lacking, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to establish a pathological fatigue model induced by 5-week combined stress and explore the mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction triggered by fatigue. Five-week combined stress induced fatigue-like phenotypes, which included reluctance to move, reduced exercise endurance, and muscle strength. Moreover, the 5-week combined stress resulted in a significant reduction in both EF and FS, along with a marked upregulation of several myocardial injury biomarkers, thereby confirming the presence of abnormal cardiac function. Targeted metabolomics analysis indicated that 80% of the differential metabolites were downregulated, suggesting a hypometabolic profile in the heart. Interestingly, among the downregulated fatty acid metabolites, we identified two bacterial metabolites, namely acetate and butyrate. More importantly, we observed an inverse correlation between the levels of acetate and butyrate and the concentrations of certain cardiac injury markers. We then observed disturbances in gut bacteria, and group differences at the genus level revealed that all six differential bacteria, which ranked in the top 10 in terms of relative abundance, may directly or indirectly influence the production of acetic acid and butyric acid. Among them, the abundance of Akkermansia bacteria was positively correlated with reduced acetic acid levels. In summary, the present study provides a novel animal model of pathological fatigue-induced cardiac dysfunction and suggests that hypometabolic features and gut microbiota dysbiosis may be an important mechanism.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "cardiovascular disease"},

Victims surviving an attack often suffer from the consequences of severe wound infections caused by the animal's sharp canine teeth. Isolation of normal flora bacteria from the oral cavity of common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious) followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing to aid in the identification of a targeted antibiotic treatment regimen for hippopotamus attack victims. Oral swabs were collected from 34 free-ranging hippopotami in three reserves within the Greater Kruger National Park Complex in South Africa and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was conducted using the disc diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer method) and a panel of 16 antibiotic drugs representing 10 antibiotic categories. Culturing of 50 oral swab samples from 34 hippopotami yielded 188 aerobic isolates belonging to 30 bacterial genera and 41 bacterial species (Gram-negative: 70.7%; Gram-positive: 29.3%) and 16 obligate anaerobic isolates from two genera. Three bacterial species, namely Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria and Shewanella putrefaciens accounted for 52% of the aerobic isolates. The anaerobic isolates were identified as Prevotella melaninogenica and Clostridium spp. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 112 aerobic isolates (Gram-negative: 93 (83%); Gram-positive: 19 (17%)) representing all isolated bacterial species. High levels of antibiotic resistance were observed among the Gram-negative species especially to most beta-lactam antibiotics (50.5% to 80.7%). Multidrug resistance was detected in 22.6% of Gram-negative isolates and in 24.1% of all isolates. This study provides the first investigation of the oral flora bacteria of the common hippopotamus. Among the 32 mostly aerobic bacterial genera the most abundant bacterial species were A. hydrophila, A. sobria and S. putrefaciens. They are typical inhabitants of the aquatic habitat of the hippopotamus and of zoonotic importance as opportunistic human pathogens. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles demonstrated that quinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines were highly efficacious against these bacterial species which otherwise showed moderate to high levels of resistance to the traditional bite wound treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 1st and 2nd generation cephalosporins.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

The viability tests were employed to assess the resistance-modifying properties of the extracts both in antibiotic-resistant bacterial cells and cancer cell-lines. To elucidate the potential mechanisms of the antibiotic modulatory activity of test extracts, the changes in H -fluxes across the cell membrane and their impact on the H -translocating F0F1-ATPase activity in antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli explored. Qualitative metabolomic characterization of the extracts was performed using LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, and quantitative analysis was carried out with UHPLC-PDA. Experiments on doxorubicin-resistant and susceptible HT-29 cells revealed that all three extracts reversed antibiotic resistance in HT-29R cells, making them susceptible to doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, blackcurrant, and fig significantly reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin and kanamycin against resistant E. coli strains. Our results indicated that all plant extracts enhanced H -fluxes in the investigated bacterial strain and promoted ATPase activity, suggesting a potential role in altering bacterial membrane integrity. LC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS analysis identified more than 100 major peaks, with flavonoids and phenolics being the dominant constituents. The study underscores the potential of the selected plant extracts in developing of new agents to overcome antibiotic resistance and enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

Recent advancements in real-time Nanopore sequencing and basecalling algorithms have enabled the direct detection of modified bases from raw signal data, eliminating the need for bisulfite treatment of DNA. However, decoding methylation signals remains challenging due to rapid technological and methodological progress. In this study, we focus on public health-relevant bacterial strains to analyze their methylation profiles and identify methylation motifs. Our dataset includes samples from Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, sequenced on the Nanopore GridION platform using the latest flow cell chemistry (R10.4.1) and modification basecalling models (Dorado basecalling SUP model v5). We investigated distinct methylation patterns within and between species, focusing on heavily modified genes or genomic regions. Our results reveal distinct species-specific methylation profiles, with each strain exhibiting unique modification patterns. We developed a modular pipeline using Nextflow and the Nanopore Modkit tool to streamline the detection of methylated motifs. We compared the results with outputs from MicrobeMod, a recent toolkit for exploring prokaryotic methylation and base modifications in nanopore sequencing. Our pipeline is publicly available for further use (github.com/rki-mf1/ont-methylation). We identified known methylation motifs already described in the literature and novel de novo motifs, providing deeper insights into the diversity of bacterial DNA modifications. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions that are extensively methylated, which could have implications for bacterial behavior and pathogenicity. We also assess improvements in basecalling accuracy, specifically how methylated bases can influence neighboring basecalls. Recent advances in basecalling models, particularly v5 models as part of Dorado, have reduced these issues, improving the reliability of methylation detection in bacterial genomes. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of current nanopore sequencing tools for detecting DNA modifications in prokaryotes.

CRPA isolates were isolated from different clinical samples, identified, and subjected to antibiotic profiling using Vitek-2 method. The detection of biofilm was performed using Congo red agar (CRA), Microdilution broth assay (MBA), and qRT-PCR detection of Bap and ompA genes. Biosynthesis of Se-NPs with a cell-free filter (CFF) of Streptomyces sp. was done and characterized with various techniques, including UV-Vis, XRD, TEM, FTIR, and Zeta potential measurement. The antibacterial efficacy and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using disc diffusion and microdilution techniques. The checkerboard assay was used to formulate various combinations of imipenem and Se-NPs, alongside time-kill assays to assess their antimicrobial efficacy. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects and hemolytic activity of Se-NPs, imipenem and their combination were assessed. The identification process and antibiotic susceptibility testing confirmed that the bacterial isolates were found to be CRPA. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the CRPA produced biofilm, and qRT-PCR demonstrated that all CRPA strains under study have the Bap and ompA genes. The CFF of Streptomyces sp. was able to biosynthesize Se-NPs which presented UV-Visible spectrometric profile with sharp peak at 290\u00a0nm. Se-NPs appeared to be a spherical shape, with particle sizes ranging from 20 to 100\u00a0nm under TEM and have zeta potential value of -40 mV.

The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values ranged from 0.37 to 0.50 against tested CRPA strain with a significant reduction in the concentrations of Se-NPs and imipenem. QRT-PCR showed that Se-NPs alone or combination of Se-NPs and imipenem led to a reduction of Bap and ompA gene expression compared to control (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001). The study showed a significant difference in cell viability was observed across normal or cancer cell lines at high concentrations.

Clinically, these bacteria have also acquired resistance to polymyxin, the last resort of defense. Novel antibiotics with a single mode of action are susceptible to rapid resistance development, and sometimes asynchronous pharmacokinetics also hinders the effectiveness of combined administration strategies in vivo. Here, we developed a class of novel bifunctional antibacterial peptides by covalently conjugating a series of modified PbgA-derived peptides with colistin analog (PE-2C-C8-DH) via a small-molecule linker (KCM02). These bifunctional peptides show remarkable synergistic antibacterial efficacy, where \"1\u2009+\u20091\u2009>\u20092\", against various priority multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, involving polymyxin-resistant strains. By optimizing the structure-activity relationship, two compounds (BP-28 and BP-37) with distinct activity preferences were obtained, which possess rapid bactericidal efficacy and a significantly lower risk of resistance compared to single-mode-of-action antibacterial agents, without hemolytic toxicity and cytotoxicity. Identification of antibacterial targets revealed that they can damage Gram-negative bacterial membrane by targeting LPS and BamA. Our study offers a referable approach for the development of novel antimicrobial agents.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"},

Yet, animal models and in vitro experiments poorly replicate real-world conditions . To explain how resistance evolves in vivo, we exposed 60 human participants to ciprofloxacin and used longitudinal stool samples and a new computational method to assemble the genomes of 5,665 populations of commensal bacterial species within participants. Analysis of 2.3 million polymorphic sequence variants revealed 513 populations that underwent selective sweeps. We found convergent evolution focused on DNA gyrase and evidence of dispersed selective pressure at other genomic loci. Roughly 10% of susceptible bacterial populations evolved towards resistance through sweeps that involved substitutions at a specific amino acid in gyrase. The evolution of gyrase was associated with large populations that decreased in relative abundance during exposure. Sweeps persisted for more than 10\u2009weeks in most cases and were not projected to revert within a year. Targeted amplification showed that gyrase mutations arose de novo within the participants and exhibited no measurable fitness cost. These findings revealed that brief ciprofloxacin exposure drives the evolution of resistance in gut commensals, with mutations persisting long after exposure. This study underscores the capacity of the human gut to promote the evolution of resistance and identifies key genomic and ecological factors that shape bacterial adaptation in vivo.", "origen": "PubMed", "categoria": "Sin categor\u00eda", "termino_busqueda": "antibiotic resistance"}

  "abstract": "Chemotherapy remains a prevalent strategy in cancer therapy; however, the emergence of drug resistance poses a considerable challenge to its efficacy. Most drug resistance arises from the accumulation of genetic mutations in a minority of resistant cells. The mechanisms underlying the emergence and progression of cancer resistance from these minority-resistant cells (MRCs) remain poorly understood. This study employs force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) alongside various biological investigations to reveal the mechanical pathways for MRCs fostering drug resistance and tumor progression. The findings show that minority Paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells have enhanced mechanical properties. These cells can transmit high-intensity forces to surrounding sensitive cells (SCs) through the force transducer, Merlin. This force transmission facilitates the assimilation of surrounding SCs, subsequently strengthening the contraction and adhesion of tumor cells. This process is termed \"mechano-assimilation,\" which accelerates the development of drug resistance and tumor progression. Interestingly, disturbances and reductions of mechano-assimilation within tumors can restore sensitivity to Paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting the contribution of MRCs to the development of drug resistance and malignancy, mediated through mechanical interactions. It also establishes a foundation for future research focused on integrating mechanical factors into innovative cancer therapies.",

  "abstract": "Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) holds significant promise for treating solid tumors but is often constrained by insufficient T-cell infiltration, survival, and functional persistence. To overcome these obstacles, we developed DON-loaded nanodrug-T cell conjugates with PD-L1 blockade, forging a dynamic mutualistic relationship between T cells and therapeutic agents. Sustained release of glutamine antagonist 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) within these conjugates continuously enhances T-cell endurance and potency by promoting memory differentiation and elevating crucial adhesion and motility genes. Concurrently, PD-L1 blocking peptides liberate T cells from immunosuppression, assisting T cells with precision toward tumor sites. This dual-targeting strategy-T cells directed at tumor antigens and peptides at PD-L1- enriches the tumor microenvironment with potent therapeutics, amplifying T cell-driven tumor destruction. Our approach effectively overcomes the critical barriers of ACT-infiltration, persistence, and efficacy-unlocking the full therapeutic potential of T-cell therapy against complex solid tumors.",

The objective of this study was to assess cardiovascular (CV), metabolic, and renal effects of combination therapy with newer generation GLP-1RA (including once-weekly GLP-1RAs, once-daily oral semaglutide, and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] agonists) and SGLT2i compared with SGLT2i alone. This retrospective cohort study included data on US adults with T2D receiving SGLT2i from Komodo's Healthcare Map from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2023. The study included 100,455 people in the combination GLP-1RA and SGLT2i group and 339,540 people in the comparison SGLT2i group across 3 cohorts: T2D with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), T2D, and T2D with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Entropy balancing was used to balance patient characteristics. Time to first event of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), 3-point major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), and 5-point MACE in T2D with ASCVD cohort were measured. In the T2D cohort, follow-up and change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA ) and weight, odds of achieving HbA  < 7% and HbA  < 8%, and odds of achieving 5%, 10%, and 15% decrease in weight were also measured. The combination and comparison groups included 34,690 and 130,220 people, respectively, in the T2D with ASCVD cohort; 8,220 and 22,891 people, respectively, in the T2D cohort; and 8,783 and 35,532 people, respectively, in the T2D with CKD cohort. Compared with SGLT2i alone, combination therapy was significantly associated with 42% lower risk of ischemic stroke, 37% lower risk of MI, 46% lower risk of 3-point MACE, and 45% lower risk of 5-point MACE among people with T2D and ASCVD. Among the individual GLP-1RAs assessed, the largest reductions in CV risk, HbA , and weight outcomes were observed with combination therapy with SGLT2i and once weekly semaglutide for T2D. Combination of SGLT2i and GLP-1RA achieved significantly better cardiometabolic outcomes compared with SGLT2i alone; this supports the hypothesis that the cardioprotective benefits of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may be additive.",

  "abstract": "Perineural spread in rectal cancer is a rare occurrence, particularly when it extensively disseminates along the lumbosacral plexus, as well as the sciatic and pudendal nerves. Its diagnosis is challenging and represents a critical prognostic factor owing to its association with higher recurrence and metastasis rates. A 55-year-old Spanish female with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma underwent standard treatment, including neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, ultra-low anterior resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Five years later, a fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan detected a hypermetabolic lesion near the right piriformis muscle and internal iliac vessels, leading to surgical excision and radiotherapy, which confirmed metastasis. Three years after that, the patient presented with right-sided sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography revealed characteristic features of perineural spread, including thickening, hyperintensity, enhancement, and diffusion restriction of the right sciatic and pudendal nerves, as well as the sacral roots (S1-S4). These findings differed from other neuropathic conditions, such as tumoral compression, traumatic neuropathy, and post-radiotherapy changes. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography and biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Despite additional chemotherapy, the disease progressed, resulting in cerebral, lung, and bone metastases. The patient passed away 1 year later. This case highlights the potential role of the magnetic resonance neurography in the accurate diagnosis of perineural spread in rectal cancer, emphasizing the value of functional magnetic resonance neurography sequences in differentiating it from other causes of neuropathic pain. This is essential for clinicians, as perineural spread is associated with a poor prognosis and necessitates appropriate management.",

  "abstract": "Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is recognized as a reliable indicator of acute hyperglycemia during stress. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are at high risk of stress hyperglycemia, but little attention has been paid to this population. This study is the first to investigate the association between SHR and both short-term and long-term prognosis in CABG patients, with a further exploration of the impact of SHR across different glucose metabolic states. A total of 18,307 patients undergoing isolated CABG were consecutively enrolled and categorized into three groups based on SHR tertiles. The perioperative outcome was defined as a composite of in-hospital death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and reoperation during hospitalization. The long-term outcome was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). Restricted cubic spline and logistic regression linked SHR to perioperative risks. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the relationship with long-term prognosis. Subgroup analyses were further conducted based on different glucose metabolic states. A U-shaped association was observed between SHR and perioperative outcome in the overall population (P for nonlinear < 0.001). As SHR increased, the risk of perioperative events initially decreased (OR per SD: 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.97, P = 0.013) and then elevated (OR per SD: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.28, P =  0.004), with an inflection point at 0.79. A similar U-shaped pattern was identified in patients with normal glucose regulation. Among those with prediabetes, the association was J-shaped, while in patients with diabetes, the association became nonsignificant when SHR exceeded 0.76. Adding SHR to the existing risk model improved the predictive performance for perioperative outcomes in the overall population (AUC: 0.720 → 0.752, P < 0.001; NRI: 0.036, P =  0.003; IDI: 0.015, P < 0.001). For long-term outcomes, the risk of events was monotonically elevated with increasing SHR, regardless of glucose metabolic status. The third tertile showed a 10.7% greater risk of MACCEs (HR: 1.107, 95% CI 1.023-1.231, P =  0.024). SHR was significantly associated with prognosis in CABG patients, demonstrating a non-linear U-shaped relationship with short-term outcomes and a linear positive association with long-term outcomes. The in-hospital risk associated with SHR was attenuated in patients with diabetes. WHAT IS CURRENTLY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC?: Stress hyperglycemia is common during the perioperative period in CABG patients and is linked to adverse short- and long-term outcomes. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel metric that accounts for baseline glycemia to better reflect acute stress-induced hyperglycemia. However, SHR has not been studied in the CABG population. WHAT IS THE KEY RESEARCH QUESTION?: This study is the first to investigate the association between SHR and both short-term and long-term prognosis in patients undergoing CABG, while further exploring its impact across different glucose metabolic states, categorized as normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, and diabetes. WHAT IS NEW?: In CABG patients, SHR shows a U-shaped relationship with perioperative events and a linear positive association with long-term outcomes, both of which are modulated by glucose metabolic status. HOW MIGHT THIS STUDYINFLUENCE CLINICAL PRACTICE?: Findings support the incorporation of SHR for risk stratification and personalized glucose management in CABG patients, ultimately improving both in-hospital and long-term prognosis.",

  "abstract": "Inflammation is a key driver of disease-related malnutrition and patients with high inflammation may not show the same benefits from nutritional therapy as other patients. We compared in an exploratory manner the prognostic ability of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to predict outcome and response to nutritional therapy, respectively, within a large cohort of patients from a previous nutritional trial. This is a secondary analysis of the Swiss-wide, multicenter, randomized controlled Effect of early nutritional therapy on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial (EFFORT) trial comparing individualized nutritional support with usual care nutrition in medical inpatients. The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality. We included 996 patients with an overall mortality rate of 6% within 30 days. Compared to patients with low IL- 6 level < 11.2pg/mL, patients with high levels had a more than 3-fold increase in mortality at 30-days (adjusted HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.95-6.28, p < 0.001), but tended to have a less pronounced mortality benefit from individualized nutritional therapy as compared to usual nutritional care (hazard ratio 0.82 vs. 0.32). CRP and TNF-α were not associated with mortality, but patients with increased CRP levels > 100 mg/dl also showed a trend towards a diminished response to nutritional intervention (hazard ratio 1.25 vs. 0.47). Our findings support the thesis that a high inflammatory state is linked to reduced benefits from nutritional therapy. Apparently, CRP and IL- 6 effectively predict treatment response, but IL- 6 may additionally serve as a prognostic marker for increased mortality. This finding might help to develop improved treatment strategies for patients with elevated inflammatory profiles. Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02517476 (registered 7 August 2015).",

DNA methylation age (DNAmA) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAmA acceleration (DNAmAA), which was calculated as residuals of leukocyte cell count adjusted linear regression of DNAmA on chronological age, were used to estimate biological age in this study. Low levels of serum selenium, selenoprotein P (SELENOP), and the selenocysteine-containing glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) are associated with adverse health outcomes and selenium supplementation is discussed as an anti-aging intervention. In this study, we cross-sectionally analyzed 1568 older participants from the observational Berlin Aging Study II (mean age ± SD: 68.8 ± 3.7 years, 51% women). Serum selenium was measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy and SELENOP was determined by sandwich ELISA. GPx3 was assessed as part of a proteomics dataset using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The relationship between selenium biomarkers and epigenetic clock measures was analyzed using linear regression analyses. P values and 95% confidence intervals (not adjusted for multiple testing) are stated for each analysis. Participants with deficient serum selenium levels (< 90 μg/L) had a higher rate of biological aging (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.033 to - 0.004, p = 0.010, n = 865). This association remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, and first four genetic principal components (β = - 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.034 to - 0.004, p = 0.012, n = 757). Compared to the highest quartile, participants in the lowest quartile of SELENOP levels showed an accelerated biological aging rate (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.03, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.051 to - 0.008, p = 0.007, n = 740, fully adjusted model). Similarly, after adjustment for confounders, accelerated biological age was found in participants within the lowest GPx3 quartile compared to participants in the fourth quartile (DunedinPACE, β = - 0.04, SE = 0.01, 95% CI - 0.06 to - 0.02, p = 0.001, n = 674 and GrimAge, β = - 0.98, SE = 0.32, 95% CI - 1.6 to - 0.4, p = 0.002, n = 608). Only the association with GPx3 remained statistically significant after multiple testing correction. Our study suggests that low levels of selenium biomarkers are associated with accelerated biological aging measured through epigenetic clocks. This effect was not substantially changed after adjustment for known confounders.",

Herein, we performed a population-based cohort study using the SEER-17 database. The primary exposure was a period of diagnosis (2014-2017 vs. 2018-2021), and these periods were selected based on the first FDA-approval of CAR-T in 2017. Study outcomes were relative survival (RS), overall survival (OS), lymphoma-specific survival (LSS), and the cumulative incidence of death from lymphoma (CIF). A total of 51,584 patients with DLBCL were included in the study with 24,861 patients diagnosed in time period-1 (2014-2017) and 26,723 patients diagnosed in time period-2 (2018-2021). The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (interquartile range, 57-77) and most patients were White (n = 42,190, 82%) with advanced stage at diagnosis (n = 28,203, 55%). In unadjusted analysis, the 5-year RS (95% CI) increased from 64% from 2014 to 2017 to 66% from 2018 to 2021, while 5-year OS increased from 54 to 55%, and 5-year LSS increased from 64 to 66%. On competing risks analysis, the 5-year probability of death from lymphoma decreased from 34 to 31%.

We found improved survival for patients with DLBCL diagnosed between 2018 and 2021 when compared to those diagnosed between 2014 and 2017.

  "abstract": "Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a necrotizing infection characterized by the production of gas in the renal parenchyma, collecting system or perirenal tissue. The treatment strategy, especially for surgical intervention, in EPN has been based on the Huang and Wan classifications. Huang's classification is based on the extent of gas and abscess spillover, while Wan's classification is based on the morphology of gas and fluid retention. Wan's classification type I EPN is considered more severe compared to type II EPN and pathophisyological mechanisms are speculated as the cause of the different presentation but the actual cause is unknown. In the present case, conservative treatment of EPN in the early stages of the disease allowed us to show that Wan's classification may represent a time series of morphologic changes throughout EPN. A 72-year-old woman treated for diabetes was admitted because of suspected treatment-resistant pyelonephritis. Her CT scan at presentation was suggestive of EPN and antibiotics was started. After additional medical treatment, a follow-up of CT image showed that the initial appearance of bubbly gas formation changed into a fluid-forming abscess. This transition shows that type I is an early phase image of EPN and type II image is seen following the early phase. Thereafter no change was seen in CT image and residing inflammation led to planned nephrectomy on day 35. Antibiotics were discontinued and no recurrence was confirmed. Wan's type I and II EPN has been often reported as different pathophysiological entities. Our case shows that these two subtypes may represent stages in the progression of EPN. Medical treatment for type I may permit safe nephrectomy for type II EPN.",

It has systemic symptoms that mainly include progressive skeletal dysplasia, cardiovascular manifestations, hepatosplenomegaly, coarse facies, and many other manifestations, and cognitive decline is observed in most cases. A significant proportion of patients may present with foetal hydrops. Allelic variations in specific ethnic groups explain the higher incidence in some groups due to founder effects and/or endogamy. In Brazil, the most common variant is p.Leu176Phe. This study aimed to investigate GUSB gene expression in a patient with MPS VII with a new mutation (p.Leu292Pro). Additionally, this study investigated the ancestry of 5 patients with MPS VII from Brazil to understand the Amerindian, African, and European contributions. The analysis revealed varying proportions of ancestry markers in the sample of patients with MPS VII. The European contribution was more prominent and significantly different (p = 0.0031) from the African contribution. Relative expression analysis by the 2  method revealed greater expression of the GUSB gene in the patient with MPS VII than in the control group (CG). However, some samples from the CG group presented higher expression than did the samples from the patient with the new mutation. Relative to the comparison among threshold cycles, 2/20 samples presented significantly different CT values for the patient with MPS VII when the numbers of amplification cycles were compared. The parents of the patient also presented different values (p < 0.05) for the amplification cycles. The in silico prediction of the new variant indicated that it affects function by modifying a highly conserved region. The p.Leu176Phe mutation may have originated in Europe, as suggested in this study. There is a discrepancy between the mRNA levels of GUSB and the amount of beta-glucuronidase synthesized. The expression of the GUSB gene variant from the patient with MPS VII was within the range of the control group's distribution in this study. The p.Leu292Pro mutation is pathogenic, but its impact on the MPS VII phenotype still needs to be fully elucidated.",

  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat due to its heterogeneity. Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) mutations are genetic drivers in numerous cancer types including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Despite recent advances in KRAS-targeted therapies, treatment resistance and limited therapeutic options necessitate advanced preclinical models, such as organoids, to identify personalized cancer therapies by screening novel therapeutic strategies and synergistic drug combinations. We established LUAD in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of Kras  & Trp53   (KP) and KP with Ctnnb1  mutation (KPC). Tumor-derived organoids from these models recapitulated the genomic landscape and histopathological characteristics of their parental tumors. The organoids displayed tumorigenic potential when implanted in immunocompromised mice, forming tumors in contrast to unlike healthy lung-derived organoids. Drug screening identified effective kinase inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors against the organoids. Notably, the combination of these drugs exhibited the highest synergy in KPC organoids. We successfully developed LUAD organoids harboring Kras mutations and identified multiple potential therapeutic agents targeting these cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a DNMT inhibitor-based combination therapy, presenting a promising strategy for this challenging lung cancer subtype.",

  "abstract": "Sri Lanka's health policies prioritize improving hypertension control. The care cascade framework, a valuable tool that has informed hypertension control strategy in many countries, has not been assessed previously in Sri Lanka. This study addresses this gap using data from a nationally representative, longitudinal cohort study, providing a baseline for future monitoring. We analysed data from the 2018-2019 first wave of the Sri Lanka Health and Ageing Study (SLHAS). The extended care cascade included: (i) prevalence, (ii) ever screened, (iii) diagnosis, (iv) awareness, (v) treatment, (vi) adherence, and (vii) control. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess factors associated with attainment of each step, conditional on prevalence and on treatment, and we assessed socioeconomic inequalities using concentration indices. We also compared performance against global estimates, and against regional and middle-income countries. We included 6,342 participants in the analysis. The weighted prevalence of hypertension was 27.6%. Of those with hypertension, 87% had their blood pressure (BP) ever measured; 53% were diagnosed; 50% were aware of their condition; 44% were taking treatment; and 20% had their blood pressure under control. Females and older adults had better cascade outcomes, but this was driven by higher rates of diagnosis. Diabetes and increased body mass index (BMI) were associated with higher diagnosis rates, but not treatment and control after diagnosis. Education and sector of residence were not associated with disparities, but treatment rates were higher in the most socioeconomic advantaged. Concentration indices confirmed pro-rich inequality across the care cascade from ever screened to treatment and adherence, but control was not unequal, with the data suggesting better control by public providers, whom the poor relied on more. Only one in five Sri Lankans with hypertension achieve BP control, with the biggest cascade losses occurring at diagnosis and control after treatment. Our findings point to a substantial influence of providers. Efforts to improve hypertension control in Sri Lanka should focus on increasing detection through opportunistic screening and improving interventions to improve physician control of BP. These findings provide actionable insights for further research and to strengthen hypertension control efforts in Sri Lanka.",

  "abstract": "Guidelines recommend combination therapy with glucagonlike peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) for cardiorenal risk reduction in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, there is limited real-world evidence on the long-term effects of combination therapy on cardiometabolic and renal outcomes. The objective of this study was to assess cardiovascular (CV), metabolic, and renal effects of combination therapy with newer generation GLP-1RA (including once-weekly GLP-1RAs, once-daily oral semaglutide, and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP] agonists) and SGLT2i compared with SGLT2i alone. This retrospective cohort study included data on US adults with T2D receiving SGLT2i from Komodo's Healthcare Map from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2023. The study included 100,455 people in the combination GLP-1RA and SGLT2i group and 339,540 people in the comparison SGLT2i group across 3 cohorts: T2D with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), T2D, and T2D with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Entropy balancing was used to balance patient characteristics. Time to first event of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), 3-point major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), and 5-point MACE in T2D with ASCVD cohort were measured. In the T2D cohort, follow-up and change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA ) and weight, odds of achieving HbA  < 7% and HbA  < 8%, and odds of achieving 5%, 10%, and 15% decrease in weight were also measured. The combination and comparison groups included 34,690 and 130,220 people, respectively, in the T2D with ASCVD cohort; 8,220 and 22,891 people, respectively, in the T2D cohort; and 8,783 and 35,532 people, respectively, in the T2D with CKD cohort. Compared with SGLT2i alone, combination therapy was significantly associated with 42% lower risk of ischemic stroke, 37% lower risk of MI, 46% lower risk of 3-point MACE, and 45% lower risk of 5-point MACE among people with T2D and ASCVD. Among the individual GLP-1RAs assessed, the largest reductions in CV risk, HbA , and weight outcomes were observed with combination therapy with SGLT2i and once weekly semaglutide for T2D. Combination of SGLT2i and GLP-1RA achieved significantly better cardiometabolic outcomes compared with SGLT2i alone; this supports the hypothesis that the cardioprotective benefits of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may be additive.",

  "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the cancer types with poorest prognosis and survival rates primarily due to resistance to standard-of-care therapies, including gemcitabine (GEM) and olaparib. Particularly, wild-type (wt)BRCA tumours, the most prevalent in PDAC, are more resistant to DNA-targeting agents like olaparib, restraining their clinical application. Recently, we disclosed a monoterpene indole alkaloid derivative (BBIT20) as a new inhibitor of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair with anticancer activity in breast and ovarian cancer. Since inhibition of DNA repair enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, we aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of BBIT20 against PDAC, particularly carrying wtBRCA. In vitro and in vivo PDAC models, particularly human cell lines (including GEM-resistant PDAC cells), patient-derived organoids and xenograft mice of PDAC were used to evaluate the anticancer potential of BBIT20, alone and in combination with GEM or olaparib. Disruption of the BRCA1-BARD1 interaction by BBIT20 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and yeast two-hybrid assay. The potent antiproliferative activity of BBIT20, superior to olaparib, was demonstrated in PDAC cells regardless of BRCA status, by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage, while downregulating HR. The disruption of DNA double-strand breaks repair by BBIT20 was further reinforced by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) suppression. The inhibition of BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer by BBIT20 was demonstrated in PDAC cells and confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In GEM-resistant PDAC cells, BBIT20 showed potent antiproliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive activity, overcoming GEM resistance by inhibiting the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, upregulating the intracellular GEM-transporter ENT1, and downregulating GEM resistance-related microRNA-20a and GEM metabolism enzymes as RRM1/2. Furthermore, BBIT20 did not induce resistance in PDAC cells. It inhibited the growth of patient-derived PDAC organoids, by inducing apoptosis, repressing HR, and potentiating olaparib and GEM cytotoxicity. The enhancement of olaparib antitumor activity by BBIT20 was confirmed in xenograft mice of PDAC. Notably, it hindered tumour growth and liver metastasis formation, improving survival of orthotopic xenograft mice of PDAC. Furthermore, its potential as a stroma-targeting agent, reducing fibrotic extracellular matrix and overcoming desmoplasia, associated with an enhancement of immune cell response by depleting PD-L1 expression in tumour tissues, renders BBIT20 even more appealing for combination therapy, particularly with immunotherapy. These findings underscore the great potential of BBIT20 as a novel multifaceted anticancer drug candidate for PDAC treatment.",

This single-centre, parallel-arm, pilot randomised controlled clinical trial (RCT) was conducted in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. The primary objective was to compare the incidence of biologic complications between conventional removable partial dentures (CRPDs) and short implant-assisted removable partial dentures (IARPDs) in patients with Kennedy Class I bilateral distal-extension edentulism. A secondary objective was to evaluate implant survival and peri-implant outcomes over a mean follow-up period of 34 months. Thirty-three partially edentulous adult participants (aged 36-87 years) were recruited. Included participants had sufficient bone height to accommodate 6 mm implants without the need for bone augmentation. A strict exclusion criteria included current smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, pregnancy or lactation, and use of immunosuppressive or antiresorptive medications. Random allocation to receive either CRPDs (n = 19) or IARPDs supported by two short implants (n = 14) was conducted after initial CRPD fabrication. Both implant- and non-implant-related biologic complications were recorded at baseline and annual follow-up visits up to four years. Parameters included caries, gingival inflammation, abutment tooth loss, peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis, and marginal bone level (MBL) changes. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square tests, Fisher's exact test and paired and unpaired t-tests, with significance set at p = 0.05. Non-implant biologic complications affected 44.7% of abutment teeth in the CRPD group and 21.4% in the IARPD group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The most common complications were gingival inflammation and caries. One abutment tooth was lost in the CRPD group versus none in the IARPD group. Peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were observed in 42.9% and 10.7% of implants, respectively. Implant survival was 81.2%. Most MBL occurred prior to prosthetic loading, with minimal loss thereafter. Both CRPDs and IARPDs are viable treatment options for patients with Kennedy Class I edentulism, with no significant difference in the incidence of biologic complications between groups.",

Octogenarians who underwent aortic arch aneurysm repair between 2007 and 2021 were included. Fifty-four patients (23 in the total arch replacement [TAR] group and 31 in the thoracic endovascular aortic repair [TEVAR] group) were included in the study. The early- and mid-term outcomes and risk factors for all-cause mortality were examined in each group. To examine timely surgical outcomes, cases of true aneurysms were included, whereas dissected aneurysms and emergency cases due to rupture or other causes were excluded. No significant differences in 30-day mortality (0% in the TAR group and 5.4% in the TEVAR group) and in-hospital mortality (7.7% in the TAR group and 8.1% in the TEVAR group) were observed between the two groups. The survival rates at 5 years were 82% and 65% in the TAR and TEVAR groups, respectively, without significant difference. The aorta-related averted mortality was 91% and 81% in the TAR and TEVAR groups, respectively, without significant difference. No significant difference in the freedom from aortic events was also observed between the two groups. Previous ischemic heart disease was a significant risk factor for all-cause mortality in the TAR group. No significant risk factors were identified in this group. The choice of procedure was reasonable when considering frailty. Endovascular repair may be a good treatment option for patients with a history of ischemic heart disease.",

To explore the potential of restoring STK11 protein in immunotherapy, a bionic gene delivery system was prepared by coating the STK11-encoded DNA-cationic polymer complex core with the tumor cell membrane, termed STK11@PPCM. STK11@PPCM could specifically bind with NSCLC cells and achieve precise delivery of STK11-encoded DNA. The released DNA effectively restored the STK11 protein expression, consequently reactivating autophagy and immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. The liberated damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and autophagosome induced dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, which in turn enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration, M1 macrophage polarization, and proinflammatory factor expression, thereby reversing the ITEM. Moreover, STK11@PPCM was also found to improve the sensitivity of cancer cells to αPD1 by increasing the expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in STK11-mutated NSCLC cell xenografted mouse models, constructed by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology. This work demonstrated for the first time that restoration of functional STK11 can effectively reverse ITME and boost αPD1 efficacy in NSCLC, offering a new therapeutic approach for STK11-mutated lung adenocarcinoma in clinic.",

  "abstract": "Chronic refractory wounds are a common, costly and recurrent complication of diabetes. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a new therapy for chronic wounds, is limited by a long treatment period and unstable effects. FG-4592(Roxadustat) is a new prolyl-4-hydroxylation domain(PHD) inhibitor, which can stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor-1α(HIF-1α) effectively. It is a promising drug for wound repair and needs to be demonstrated via various appropriate application scenarios. This study investigated the effects of combining FG-4592 and PRP to promote diabetic wound healing. Diabetic rats were randomly assigned to five groups: nondiabetic control, diabetic untreated, diabetic + PRP, diabetic + FG-4592, and diabetic + PRP + FG-4592. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ). A full-thickness skin defect was created, and FG-4592 (peritoneal injection) and PRP (periwound injection) were administered alone or together. Wound healing was assessed by histological analysis (Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Masson staining) and protein expression of HIF-1α, VEGF(vascular endothelial growth factor), α-SMA(α-smooth muscle actin), CoL1α1(collagen type 1 alpha 1), and SDF-1(Stromal Cell-derived Factor 1) via Western blotting and qRT-PCR(Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction). Immunohistochemistry(IHC) and immunofluorescence(IF) were also used to evaluate CD34 (Cluster of Differentiation 34), CD31(Cluster of Differentiation 31), VEGF(vascular endothelial growth factor), SDF-1(Stromal Cell-derived Factor 1), PCNA(Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen), and Integrin-β1 expression. The untreated diabetic group exhibited impaired wound healing, histological damage, and reduced expression of key proteins compared to the nondiabetic control group. Both PRP and FG-4592 alone improved wound healing, reduced damage, and upregulated protein expression. However, the combination of FG-4592 and PRP showed the most significant improvement. This study suggests that FG-4592 combined with PRP accelerates diabetic wound healing by enhancing endothelial progenitor cell recruitment, neovascularization, and cell proliferation and migration via upregulation of HIF-1α and its target genes. This combination therapy may provide a novel approach for treating chronic diabetic wounds.",

  "abstract": "Authors of a matched cohort study claimed the NHS Health Check programme reduced total mortality 23% and liver cirrhosis incidence 44%. Such impressive results require critical scrutiny, especially as the intervention targets a large, predominantly healthy population, and as it has harms and costs. Eleven high-quality randomised trials containing varying combinations of the elements constituting the NHS Health Check assessed total mortality. They included 233,298 participants and 21,535 deaths, with a risk ratio for total mortality of 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.03) and little or no effect on mortality from targeted diseases, including cardiovascular disease. However, the observational study did not reference any of those trials. No harms, though well-known, were assessed or mentioned. While some limitations were discussed, others were not and central questions regarding the likelihood of their results were not asked. A burden of proof must be met before interventions are introduced, especially those directed towards healthy citizens that divert resources away from medical and non-medical interventions of known benefit. In our opinion, the NHS Health Check programme does not meet UK National Screening Committee requirements that high-quality randomized trials show benefits outweigh harms. Emphasizing evidence from observational studies while disregarding randomised trials that contradict their findings and failing to assess or mention harms of interventions directed at healthy citizens, are contrary to sound scientific principles, and to evidence-based medicine. This apparently guides policies which burden an already stressed health system. A review of the NHS Health Check programme by the UK National Screening Committee seems timely.",

We analyzed two cases of gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors with clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment and flow-up. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of BRG1 (SAMRCA4), SMARCB1 (INI-1), CKpan, Ki-67, CD3, CD20, CD163, PD-1, and PD-L1 in gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors. Additionally, the clinical characteristics, imaging features, diagnosis, and treatment were analyzed. Two elderly male patients (69 and 61 years old) with a large ulcerated mass located in the gastric fundus and cardia. Histologically, the tumor is of low adhesion, diffusely infiltrating lamellar growth, without any percentage of epithelial differentiation zones, and with little stromal component. Tumor cells round, oval, a small amount of irregular shape, easy to see mitotic figures. Some of them had obvious nucleoli, and a few had multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm varies, and some cells are more abundant. Significant vascular and neural invasion. BRG1(SMARCA4) was absent, INI-1 was present, and Ki-67 proliferation index was highly expressed (≥ 80%). The remaining sarcoma-specific markers were negative. In case 1, the epithelial markers were negative and the PD-L1 combined positive score was 5. In case 2, CKpan was weakly expressed in only a dozen cells, and the PDL1 CPS was 10. The two patients received chemotherapy and anti-PD1 immunotherapy after radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The postoperative follow-up time of the two patients was 16 (case 1) and 3 months (case 2), respectively. The general condition was good, no recurrence or metastasis was observed, and the plasma tumor markers were in the normal range. Large SMARCA4-deficient tumors are more likely to have massive necrosis on the surface, leading to negative biopsy results. This tumor has a diffuse lamellar growth and needs to be differentiated from a variety of tumors with similar morphology, such as lymphoma, malignant melanoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma and undifferentiated sarcoma. The tumor cells were negative or only slightly positive for CKpan increases the difficulty of pathological diagnosis of this disease. However, loss of BRG1 (SMARCA4) expression can confirm the diagnosis. Chemotherapy combined with anti-PD1 treatment may have potential benefits in the management of gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors. However, given the rarity of these tumors and the limited number of cases in our study, further research with larger cohorts is needed to validate these preliminary results.",

  "abstract": "Aldehyde reductase (ALR1) is the enzyme that speeds up the reduction of many types of aldehydes into sorbitol and D-glucose. The essential enzyme of the polyol pathway, aldose reductase (ALR2), is responsible for the development of chronic complications associated with diabetes when activated under hyperglycemic conditions. Since it is a crucial mediator for the oxidative and inflammatory signaling pathways, ALR is thought to be a target for various diseases. Many medicines are available for the treatment of ALR-associated issues but due to their long term side-effects they are not effectively used. Coumarin is a naturally occurring compound, and its derivatives are widely used in the treatment of many ailments. Therefore, in the pursuit to find potential alternate candidates as drug leads, we have prepared new coumarin-based Schiff base analogues using DABCO-C -F ionic liquid and compared with conventional method. The sustainable approach making use of DABCO-C -F ionic liquid, not only made the synthesis easier but also it is cost- and time-effective. The synthesized analogues were further examined for their potentials against ALR2 (IC  = 1.61 to 11.20 µM) as well as checked selectivity via screening against ALR1 enzyme. Moreover, the molecular docking study was performed to elucidate the binding interactions of active compounds. The results showed that the synthesized compounds may have the potential to be further studied as new and selective anti-diabetic agents.",

  "abstract": "Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is recognized as a reliable indicator of acute hyperglycemia during stress. Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are at high risk of stress hyperglycemia, but little attention has been paid to this population. This study is the first to investigate the association between SHR and both short-term and long-term prognosis in CABG patients, with a further exploration of the impact of SHR across different glucose metabolic states. A total of 18,307 patients undergoing isolated CABG were consecutively enrolled and categorized into three groups based on SHR tertiles. The perioperative outcome was defined as a composite of in-hospital death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and reoperation during hospitalization. The long-term outcome was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs). Restricted cubic spline and logistic regression linked SHR to perioperative risks. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the relationship with long-term prognosis. Subgroup analyses were further conducted based on different glucose metabolic states. A U-shaped association was observed between SHR and perioperative outcome in the overall population (P for nonlinear < 0.001). As SHR increased, the risk of perioperative events initially decreased (OR per SD: 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.97, P = 0.013) and then elevated (OR per SD: 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.28, P =  0.004), with an inflection point at 0.79. A similar U-shaped pattern was identified in patients with normal glucose regulation. Among those with prediabetes, the association was J-shaped, while in patients with diabetes, the association became nonsignificant when SHR exceeded 0.76. Adding SHR to the existing risk model improved the predictive performance for perioperative outcomes in the overall population (AUC: 0.720 → 0.752, P < 0.001; NRI: 0.036, P =  0.003; IDI: 0.015, P < 0.001). For long-term outcomes, the risk of events was monotonically elevated with increasing SHR, regardless of glucose metabolic status. The third tertile showed a 10.7% greater risk of MACCEs (HR: 1.107, 95% CI 1.023-1.231, P =  0.024). SHR was significantly associated with prognosis in CABG patients, demonstrating a non-linear U-shaped relationship with short-term outcomes and a linear positive association with long-term outcomes. The in-hospital risk associated with SHR was attenuated in patients with diabetes. WHAT IS CURRENTLY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC?: Stress hyperglycemia is common during the perioperative period in CABG patients and is linked to adverse short- and long-term outcomes. The stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) is a novel metric that accounts for baseline glycemia to better reflect acute stress-induced hyperglycemia. However, SHR has not been studied in the CABG population. WHAT IS THE KEY RESEARCH QUESTION?: This study is the first to investigate the association between SHR and both short-term and long-term prognosis in patients undergoing CABG, while further exploring its impact across different glucose metabolic states, categorized as normal glucose regulation, prediabetes, and diabetes. WHAT IS NEW?: In CABG patients, SHR shows a U-shaped relationship with perioperative events and a linear positive association with long-term outcomes, both of which are modulated by glucose metabolic status. HOW MIGHT THIS STUDYINFLUENCE CLINICAL PRACTICE?: Findings support the incorporation of SHR for risk stratification and personalized glucose management in CABG patients, ultimately improving both in-hospital and long-term prognosis.",

  "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with poor prognosis. Dysregulation of E2F transcription factors (E2Fs), which control cell proliferation and apoptosis, is implicated in HNSCC pathogenesis. This study explores HNSCC molecular heterogeneity via E2Fs expression, identifies distinct subtypes, and develops a prognostic model that integrates gene expression, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. We analyzed the TCGA-HNSC dataset (n = 494) and classified samples based on the expression of eight E2Fs using ConsensusClusterPlus. The optimal number of clusters (k = 2) was determined with the getOptK() function, which assesses cluster stability via internal consistency metrics. Differentially expressed genes between subtypes were identified with limma, and functional annotation was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. A prognostic model was constructed using LASSO regression on genes significant in univariate Cox analysis and validated in an independent GSE41613 dataset (n = 97). Immune cell infiltration was estimated using CIBERSORT, and drug sensitivity predicted via pRRophetic. Confounding factors such as HPV and smoking status were not included due to incomplete data. Two distinct E2F-based subtypes emerged. Cluster 1, characterized by lower E2Fs expression, exhibited poorer overall survival (log-rank, p = 0.035) and was enriched in genes related to epidermal development, keratinocyte differentiation, and IL-17 signaling. In contrast, Cluster 2 showed higher E2Fs expression, better survival, and enrichment in genes associated with DNA replication and repair. Notably, high-risk patients demonstrated increased infiltration of M0 and M2 macrophages (p < 0.05), suggesting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that adversely affects prognosis. Our seven-gene prognostic model (AREG, CXCL14, FAM83E, FDCSP, ARHGAP4, EPHX3, and SPINK6) exhibited robust performance with AUCs of 0.692, 0.673, and 0.679 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, a C-index of 0.66, and good calibration. High-risk patients also showed greater sensitivity to targeted agents such as pazopanib and imatinib. These findings reveal two distinct E2F-based molecular subtypes of HNSCC that differ in prognosis, functional pathways, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. The prognostic model offers valuable risk stratification and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, warranting further experimental and clinical validation.",

  "abstract": "Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), encompassing conditions simple liver steatosis (MAFL) and metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is the most prevalent chronic liver disease. Currently, the management of MASLD is impeded by the lack of reliable diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic strategies. We analyzed eight independent clinical MASLD datasets from the GEO database. Differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNA) were used to identify 23 genes related to inflammation. Five hub genes were selected using machine learning techniques (SVM-RFE, LASSO, and RandomForest) combined with a literature review. Nomograms were created to predict MASLD incidence, and the diagnostic potential of the hub genes was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks, functional enrichment, and immune infiltration analyses were performed. Potential transcription factors and therapeutic agents were also explored. Finally, the expression and biological significance of these hub genes were validated using MASLD animal model, histological examination and transcriptomic profiles. We identified five hub genes-UBD/FAT10, STMN2, LYZ, DUSP8, and GPR88-that are potential biomarkers for MASLD. These genes exhibited strong diagnostic potential, either individually or in combination. This study highlights five key biomarkers as promising candidates for understanding MASLD. These findings offer new insights into the disease's pathophysiology and may contribute to the development of better diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",

Elucidating the intricate molecular pathways that drive the progression of HCC is imperative for devising targeted and effective therapeutic interventions. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) serve as pivotal regulators of post-transcriptional processes, influencing various cellular functions. This review endeavors to provide a comprehensive analysis of the expression, function, and potential implications of RBPs in HCC. We discuss the classification and diverse roles of RBPs, with a particular focus on key RBPs implicated in HCC and their association with disease progression. Additionally, we explore the mechanisms by which RBPs contribute to HCC, including their impact on gene expression, cell proliferation, cell metastasis, angiogenesis, signaling pathways, and post-transcriptional modifications. Importantly, we examine the potential of RBPs as therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into their relevance in HCC treatment. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the functional mechanisms of RBPs and their clinical translation for personalized HCC therapy.

However, early identification of long-term survivors remains a challenge. Progression-free survival at 24 months (PFS24) has emerged as a key prognostic marker in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but its relevance in PCNSL is still unclear. In this retrospective multicenter study, we analyzed data from 146 newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible PCNSL patients treated with MATRix-like regimens across 14 hospitals. With a median follow-up of 48 months, the 2-year PFS and OS rates were 50.4% and 65.6%, respectively. Of the 139 patients evaluable for PFS24-analysis, 51.1% reached PFS24, with a subsequent 5-year OS of 96.7%. Of note, the annual hazard rate for progression and death decreased to under 5% after 24 months, remaining stable thereafter. The patients who failed to reach PFS24 had a median OS of only 6.0 months. Key predictors of PFS failure included impaired Karnofsky performance status and treatment dose-reduction. In conclusion, PFS24 was identified as an important prognostic marker in PCNSL. Patients who achieve PFS24 have a favorable prognosis, whereas those who do not face poor outcomes and require innovative treatment approaches. This insight could aid in risk stratification and support the use of PFS24 as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials.",

  "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have found an association between air pollution and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CACD) and its subtypes. However, there is a lack of individual-level data to explore the associations of air pollutants on CACD and its subtypes, the interaction among them, and the potential mechanism. This study employed a two-stage design, combining a time-stratified case-crossover study with a cohort study, analyzing data from one million individuals from China and half million from the UK. The study assessed the impact of air pollutants on CACD and its subtypes, while also examining the mediating effects of inflammation. Distributed lag non-linear models were used to analyze the lagged effects of pollutants, and mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate the role of inflammatory markers (SII, SIRI, AISI) in the relationship between air pollution and CACD. A total of 829,135 CSDs patients were recorded in this study. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in concentrations of PM , PM , NO , SO , CO, and O  was associated with increases of 11.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.5%-13.2%], 10.5% (95% CI 8.6%-12.3%), 3% (95% CI 1%-5%), 15.2% (95% CI 13.3%-17.1%), 15.5% (95% CI 11.6%-19.5%), and 2.8% (95% CI 2.2%-3.4%) in CSDs, respectively. A similar positive association was also observed for cardiovascular and ischemic heart diseases. A significant synergistic interaction between PM  and NO  and CO for CSDs. Approximately 64.75%, 21.13%, 32.2%, 2.31%, 43.7% and 43.7% of the effects of PM , PM , NO , SO , CO, and O  on CSDs were significantly mediated by SII. This study provides robust evidence that short-term exposure to common air pollutants significantly increases the risk of CACD and its subtypes, with inflammation playing a crucial mediating role. The findings underscore the importance of coordinated air pollution control strategies and public health interventions to mitigate the cardiovascular risks associated with air pollution.",

  "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is highly challenging to treat due to its poor prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Liposomal nanotechnology has emerged as a promising drug delivery platform in oncology, but existing liposomal therapies face limitations such as systemic toxicity, insufficient tumor selectivity, and low target specificity. Mesothelin (MSLN), an antigen overexpressed in PAAD, has attracted attention as a potential target for precision therapy. Here, we present the development of an anti-MSLN nanobody (D3 Nb) with high binding affinity (K  = 2.2 nM) that can selectively bind to MSLN-positive cancer cells. Structural analysis revealed that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds within the complementary determining region (CDR) of D3 Nb promote strong binding to MSLN, leading to significant inhibition of AKT/NF-κB signaling and downregulation of fibronectin 1 (FN1) and twist1, key drivers of PAAD oncogenicity. In vivo studies confirmed that D3 Nb alone inhibits tumor progression. Furthermore, selective delivery to MSLN-positive tumors in combination with gemcitabine-loaded liposomes (D3-LNP-GEM) significantly improved cytotoxicity and promoted tumor regression. These findings highlight the potential of the D3-LNP-GEM platform as a novel targeted therapy for MSLN-expressing malignancies, showing promising efficacy in preclinical models and paving the way for continued clinical evaluation.",

  "abstract": "Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression in the brain is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond their conventional role in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, certain miRNAs can act extracellularly as signaling molecules. Our study elucidates the identity of such miRNA species serving as ligands for membrane receptors expressed in central nervous system (CNS) neurons and the impact of such miRNAs on neurons in the context of neurodegenerative disease. We combined a machine learning approach with the analysis of disease-associated miRNA databases to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated miRNAs as potential signaling molecules for single-stranded RNA-sensing Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8. TLR-expressing HEK-Blue reporter cells, primary murine microglia, and human THP-1 macrophages were used to validate the AD miRNAs as ligands for human and mouse TLR7 and/or TLR8. Interaction between mouse cortical neurons and extracellularly applied AD miRNAs was analyzed by live cell imaging and confocal microscopy. Transcriptome changes in cortical neurons exposed to AD miRNAs were assessed by RNAseq and RT-qPCR. The extracellular AD miRNAs' effects on CNS neuron structure were investigated in cell cultures of murine primary cortical neurons and iPSC-derived human cortical neurons by immunocytochemistry. We employed a mouse model of intrathecal injection to assess effects of AD miRNAs acting as signaling molecules on neurons in vivo. We identified the AD-associated miRNAs miR-124-5p, miR-92a-1-5p, miR-9-5p, and miR-501-3p as novel endogenous ligands for TLR7 and/or TLR8. These miRNAs being extracellularly stable and active were taken up by murine cortical neurons via endocytosis and induced changes in neuronal inflammation-, proliferation-, and apoptosis-related gene expression. Exposure of both murine and human cortical neurons to the AD-associated miRNAs led to alterations of dendrite and axon structure, synapse protein expression, and cell viability in a sequence-dependent fashion. Extracellular introduction of the AD miRNAs into the cerebrospinal fluid of mice resulted in both changes in neuronal structure and synapses, and neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex. Most of the observed extracellular miRNA-induced effects on cortical neurons involved TLR7/8 signaling. Neurodegenerative disease-associated miRNAs in extracellular form act as signaling molecules for CNS neurons including human cortical neurons, thereby modulating their structure and viability.",

  "abstract": "Medications that reduce blood pressure and cholesterol are among the most cost-effective healthcare interventions available, but their delivery remains suboptimal. In 2009, the National Health Service (NHS) Health Check was introduced to increase the detection and treatment of major cardiovascular risk factors in people aged 40-74 years. In a prospective observational study using the UK Biobank, we compared health outcomes between NHS Health Check attenders and matched non-attenders. Attenders exhibited higher early rates of new hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and chronic kidney disease, followed by significantly lower long-term multi-system disease and mortality. A recent critique of our work raises questions regarding observational design limitations, self-selection bias, and discrepancies with randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, RCTs face ethical and feasibility challenges in large-scale public health interventions and are not immune to self-selection. Furthermore, the argument that self-selection explains our findings is inconsistent with our results. If healthier individuals were disproportionately attending NHS Health Checks, we would expect lower risk across all outcomes. However, we observed an initial increase in new diagnoses suggesting that NHS Health Checks are detecting pre-existing conditions earlier rather than merely attracting healthier individuals. Additionally, the cited RCTs predate modern antihypertensive and statin treatments, and considered heterogenous non-validated interventions. In summary, this critique relies on selective citation of outdated and inappropriate RCTs, an overstatement of selection bias, and an underappreciation of the role of observational research in shaping public health improvements. Our findings indicate that NHS Health Checks contribute to the prevention of multi-system morbidity and mortality, warranting continued investment.",

  "abstract": "Talaromycosis has long been considered to be exclusively associated with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). In recent years, with effective control measures for HIV, the number of talaromycosis patients without HIV infection has been increasing annually. All of these patients have various immunosuppressive factors, including tumors. However, we find that talaromycosis among HIV-negative lung cancer patients remains a rarity and is without comprehensive reviews, contributing to significant gaps in clinical knowledge. We report a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma combined with Talaromyces marneffei (T.marneffei) infection in an HIV-negative patient. The patient, a male with a history of long-term smoking, presented with recurrent fever and cough. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed pleural effusion and nodules. The patient was diagnosed with lung squamous cell carcinoma and talaromycosis through sputum cytology and blood/cerebrospinal fluid metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The patient underwent only antifungal therapy and succumbed to respiratory failure, liver and kidney failure, and sepsis in January 2024, before receiving any anti-tumor therapy. The mortality rate of talaromycosis combined with lung cancer is extremely high. Therefore, regardless of whether patients have a history of travel to endemic areas of T. marneffei infection, it is crucial to test for HIV and anti-IFN-γ autoantibodies (AIGA) in patients suspected of having a pulmonary fungal infection, as well as conducting multiple cultures of specimens from different sites and utilizing mNGS to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, it is essential to perform biopsies in various methods from multiple sites to ascertain the presence of lung cancer. With effective control of T. marneffei infection and timely diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, there can be a significant improvement in patient survival rates.",

  "abstract": "Mucosal melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, remains challenging to manage due to the lack of effective therapies. Mucin 18 (MUC18) is overexpressed in both primary and metastatic lesions of melanoma but rarely in normal tissues. The expression profile makes MUC18 a potential target for development of therapeutic antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy. This study aims to generate an effective CAR-T targeting MUC18-positive melanoma and evaluate its preclinical antitumor activity. A humanized anti-MUC18 single chain antibody fragment (scFv) was used to construct CAR-T with various designs of the hinge, transmembrane, co-stimulatory, and CD3ζ domains. The antitumor efficacy of MUC18 CAR-T cells was assessed in vitro, in MUC18-positive primary and rechallenged xenograft models, as well as in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human mucosal melanoma. The humanized scFv selectively bound to MUC18 with high affinity. Various MUC18 CAR-T cells specifically killed MUC18-positive melanoma cells and could proliferate as a result of exposure to antigen. Among them, CAR-T cells containing an IgG4-derived hinge domain and a CD28 co-stimulatory domain demonstrated superior antitumor efficiency. Robust tumor regression and CAR-T cell expansion were observed in multiple MUC18-positive xenograft models after treatment with the IgG4 hinge and CD28 empowered CAR-T cells. This study demonstrated the development of a novel CAR-T therapy for mucosal melanoma, MUC18 CAR-T, that showed strong potency in tumor eradication and inhibition of tumor relapse. This candidate CAR-T therapy could provide a promising strategy for the treatment of the refractory melanoma.",

Oncolytic herpes virus (oHSV) initiates direct tumor debulking by tumor lysis and activates anti-tumor immunity, however, little is known about the role of glioma metabolism in determining oHSV efficacy. Here we identify that oHSV rewires central carbon metabolism increasing glucose utilization towards oxidative phosphorylation and shuttling glutamine towards reductive carboxylation in IDH wildtype glioma. The switch in metabolism results in increased lipid synthesis and cellular ROS. PKC induces ACSL4 in oHSV treated cells leading to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is critical to launch an anti-tumor immune response which is important for viral efficacy. Mutant IDH (IDHR132H) gliomas are incapable of reductive carboxylation and hence ferroptosis. Pharmacological blockade of IDHR132H induces ferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity. This study provides a rationale to use an IDHR132H inhibitor to treat high grade IDH-mutant glioma patients undergoing oHSV treatment.",

  "abstract": "Obesity, a worldwide health emergency, is defined by excessive fat accumulation and significantly impacts metabolic health. In addition to its recognized association with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other metabolic illnesses, recent studies have revealed the connection between obesity and neurodegeneration. The main reason for this link is inflammation caused by the growth of fat tissue, which activates harmful processes that affect how the brain works. Fat tissue, particularly the fat around the organs, produces various substances that cause inflammation, such as cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6), adipokines (leptin, resistin), and free fatty acids. These chemicals cause low-grade, persistent systemic inflammation, which is becoming more widely acknowledged as a major factor in peripheral metabolic dysfunction and pathology of the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammatory signals in the brain cause neuroinflammatory reactions that harm neuronal structures, change neuroplasticity, and disrupt synaptic function. When obesity-related inflammation is present, the brain's resident immune cells, known as microglia, become hyperactivated, which can lead to the production of neurotoxic chemicals, which can cause neuronal death. This neuroinflammation exacerbates the negative effects of obesity on brain health and is linked to cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) exhibits increased permeability during inflammatory states, facilitating the infiltration of peripheral immune cells and cytokines into the brain, hence exacerbating neurodegeneration. Adipose tissue is a source of chronic inflammatory mediators, which are examined in this review along with the molecular pathways that connect inflammation brought on by obesity to neurodegeneration. Additionally, it addresses various anti-inflammatory treatment approaches, including lifestyle modifications, anti-inflammatory medications, and gut microbiota modulation, to lessen the metabolic and neurological effects of obesity. Recognizing the link between obesity and inflammation opens up new opportunities for early intervention and the development of targeted treatments to prevent or alleviate neurodegenerative disorders.",

  "abstract": "The spectrum of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is expanding to atypical clinical presentations that can mimic neurodegenerative disorders. Among the autoantibodies most frequently associated with manifestations mimicking neurodegenerative disorders-such as dementia, parkinsonism, ataxia and motor neuron disease-IgLON5-, LGI1- and CASPR2-antibodies, predominantly of the IgG4 subclass and associated with specific HLA haplotypes, are the most common. Since these forms of autoimmune encephalitis often lack inflammatory findings in cerebrospinal fluid or magnetic resonance imaging, recognizing clinical 'red flags' suggestive of an autoimmune etiology is crucial for accurate diagnosis and timely initiation of immunotherapy. Interestingly, in these forms of autoimmune encephalitis, both inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease mechanisms may be involved. The neurodegenerative component may result directly from antibody effects (e.g., tau deposition in IgLON5-antibody disease) or arise through other mechanisms (e.g., seizures or exacerbation of pre-existing pathology). Moreover, neuroinflammation has recently emerged as a key contributor to primary neurodegenerative disorders. For instance, microglial activation promotes tau pathology propagation, as observed in Alzheimer's disease and other primary neurodegenerative disorders. While the precise mechanisms linking inflammation and neurodegeneration remain to be fully understood, further research into the interplay between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration may enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms and expand therapeutic opportunities in both autoimmune and neurodegenerative neurological disorders.",

  "abstract": "Plasmids are key in creating a dynamic reservoir of genetic diversity, yet their impact on Earth's continental subsurface-an important microbial reservoir-remains unresolved. We analyzed 32 metagenomic samples from six groundwater wells within a hillslope aquifer system to assess the genetic and functional diversity of plasmids and to evaluate the role of these plasmids in horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Our results revealed 4,609 non-redundant mobile genetic elements (MGEs), with 14% (664) confidently classified as plasmids. These plasmids displayed well-specific populations, with fewer than 15% shared across wells. Plasmids were linked to diverse microbial phyla, including Pseudomonadota (42.17%), Nitrospirota (3.31%), Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria (2.56%), and Omnitrophota (2.11%). The presence of plasmids in the dominant CPR bacteria is significant, as this group remains underexplored in this context. Plasmid composition strongly correlated with well-specific microbial communities, suggesting local selection pressures. Functional analyses highlighted that conjugative plasmids carry genes crucial for metabolic processes, such as cobalamin biosynthesis and hydrocarbon degradation. Importantly, we found no evidence of high confidence emerging antibiotic resistance genes, contrasting with findings from sewage and polluted groundwater. Overall, our study emphasizes the diversity, composition, and eco-evolutionary role of plasmids in the groundwater microbiome. The absence of known antibiotic resistance genes highlights the need to preserve groundwater in its pristine state to safeguard its unique genetic and functional landscape.",

  "abstract": "Mammalian secreted venoms mainly consist of peptides and proteases used for defense or predation. Blarina paralytic peptides (BPPs), mealworm-targeting neurotoxins from shrew, are very similar to human synenkephalin. This peptide is released from proenkephalin in the brain along with opioid peptides that mediate analgesic and antidepressant effects, though its physiological function is unclear. Here we synthesized and characterized human synenkephalin [1-53] (hSYN), and reveal its disulfide bond connectivity. Similar to BPP2, hSYN caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the human T-type voltage-gated calcium channel (hCav3.2) at 0.74 µM, but did not paralyze mealworms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that hSYN and BPP2 interact with hCav3.2 channel differently, due to differences in polar residues. Since Cav3.2 channel regulates neuronal excitability and is implicated in conditions like autism and epilepsy, our findings on hSYN could provide insights into the channel gating and agonistic mechanisms, along with potential pathways for developing treatments for neurological disorders.",

Identifying the prevalence of bacteriuria, the causative organisms, and their anti-microbial susceptibility profiles against commonly prescribed antibiotics used to treat UTIs among pregnant women is an aim this study seeks to attain. This aim is critical in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 3.1 and 3.2, targeted at reducing the scourge of global maternal mortality. This hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women seeking antenatal care at a secondary health facility in Ghana. Mid-stream urine samples from the study participants were collected aseptically, and their physical and biochemical composition was determined semi-quantitatively. Urine samples were examined, and microscopy was conducted, after which they were cultured. Organisms in significant urine culture growth were isolated and tested against commonly prescribed antibiotics used to treat UTIs at the facility using standard protocols to determine their antibiotic sensitivity patterns. A total of 200 pregnant women with a mean age of 27.8 ± 6.1 years participated in the study. Almost half, 48.0% (96) of all the study participants, reported for booking in the second trimester of their pregnancy. A 39.0% (78/200) positive culture growth in all the urine samples, with bacteria species responsible for the culture growth in 21.5% (43/200) of the total urine samples, was noted in this study. Ninety-one organisms were isolated, with 38.5% (35/91) being yeast-like cells, 31.9% (29/91) Escherichia coli, and 8.8% (8) Pseudomonas spp and 7.7% (7) being Klebsiella spp. There was a varying resistance of the isolated bacteria, ranging from 50.0% to 100.0%, to commonly prescribed antibiotics used in treating UTIs at the facility. Bacteriuria in the study participants was relatively high, which warrants screening all pregnant women and treating those infected with appropriate anti-microbial regimens to reduce its complications. Also, the variable sensitivity of isolated bacteria to commonly prescribed antibiotics at the facility is a concern; as such, health education on anti-microbial stewardship should be incorporated into routine antenatal education for pregnant women in Ghana.",

Results from the first open-label trial of senolytics, dasatinib plus quercetin (D ​+ ​Q), in older adults (N ​= ​5) with early AD demonstrated central nervous system penetration of dasatinib and favorable safety and tolerability. Herein, we present exploratory analyses of senescence and AD-associated analytes in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine from this study in effort to guide biomarker development for future senolytic trials. Immunoassays, mass spectrometry and transcriptomics were performed and changes in analyte levels were assessed from baseline to post-treatment using paired t-tests. Targeted cytokine and chemokine analyses revealed increases in plasma fractalkine and MMP-7 and CSF IL-6 from baseline to post-treatment. Mass spectrometry indicated stable levels of amyloid β and tau proteins in CSF, unchanged urinary metabolites, and modest treatment-associated lipid profile changes. Targeted transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated downregulation of inflammatory genes including FOS, FOSB, IL1β, IL8, JUN, JUNB, PTGS2. The levels and treatment responses of the analytes identified here may help inform trial design and outcomes for senolytic studies.

This cross-sectional study assessed the knowledge and practices of 20 HCPs about antibiotic use and resistance and evaluated quality indicators of antibiotic use of 200 prescriptions. We observed that 20% of the participants incorrectly placed amoxicillin in the cephalosporin group, and 10% considered antibiotic resistance a rejection reaction by the patient's body. However, the HCPs showed Knowledge level A. Antibiotics featured in 88% of prescriptions, with an average of one antibiotic per prescription. Cotrimoxazole (30.77%) and amoxicillin (26.15%) were the most frequently prescribed antibiotics. Cotrimoxazole was more prescribed for adults (21.54%) and amoxicillin for children (17.95%). Seasonal variation was observed with an increased winter consumption of cotrimoxazole and phenoxymethylpenicillin in summer. The results revealed a high level of knowledge of HCPs about how to use and identify antibiotics. A higher frequency of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions was observed with cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin being the most prescribed.",

  "abstract": "Myelin formation is considered the last true \"invention\" in the evolution of vertebrate nervous system cell structure. The rapid jumping pulse propagation achieved by myelin enables the high conduction speed that is the basis of human movement, sensation, and cognitive function. As a key structure in the brain, white matter is the gathering place of myelin. However, with age, white matter-associated functions become abnormal and a large number of myelin sheaths undergo degenerative changes, causing serious neurological and cognitive disorders. Despite the extensive time and effort invested in exploring myelination and its functions, numerous unresolved issues and challenges persist. In-depth exploration of the functional role of myelin may bring new inspiration for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and even mental illnesses. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the structure and key molecules of the myelin in the CNS, delving into its formation process. Specifically, we propose a new hypothesis regarding the source of power for myelin expansion in which membrane compaction may serve as a driving force for myelin extension. The implications of this hypothesis could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of diseases involving myelin malfunction and open new avenues for therapeutic intervention in myelin-related disorders. 髓鞘形成被誉为是神经系统细胞结构中脊椎动物进化的最后一个真正“发明”，它能够实现快速、跳跃式的脉冲传播，而高传导速度是人类运动、感觉和认知功能的基础。白质作为大脑中的关键结构，是有髓髓鞘的聚集地。然而，随着年龄的增长，白质功能发生异常，大量髓鞘表现出退行性变化，从而引起了严重的神经行为和认知障碍。尽管科学家在探究髓鞘形成以及其功能方面投入了大量的时间和精力，但依旧有许多问题尚未解决，且面临着诸多挑战。深入探究髓鞘的功能作用可能对中枢神经系统疾病甚至精神病的治疗带来启发。在本综述中，我们详细阐述了髓鞘的结构和相应的关键分子，以及其形成的过程。同时，针对髓鞘延伸的动力来源，我们提出了新的假设，即膜压实为髓鞘的扩张提供了动力，这将为更好地认识髓鞘病变相关疾病的病理生理学机制提供有价值的见解，并为髓鞘相关疾病的治疗干预开辟新的途径。.",

  "abstract": "Neonatal omphalitis is a true medical emergency that can rapidly progress to sepsis and even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated appropriately. Empirical therapy is widely practised in this case, too, in low-income countries like Ethiopia, paving the way for severe drug resistance and posing serious challenges. To determine the magnitude, bacterial profile, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, and associated factors of omphalitis among clinically suspected neonates attending four government health institutions in Arba Minch, southern Ethiopia, during the second half of 2023. A facility-based multi-centred cross-sectional study was conducted among 379 clinically suspected neonates who attended the inpatient/outpatient departments and intensive care units of four government health institutes of Arba Minch from June 1 to December 28, 2023. Study participants were consecutively recruited, and their demographic and clinical data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Samples were aseptically collected and inoculated onto a series of bacterial culture media, namely MacConkey agar, mannitol salt agar, chocolate, and blood agar, and different species were identified by means of several biochemical tests. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed through the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion technique. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models (SPSS version 25) were utilized to analyze the association between dependent and independent variables; P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The overall number of clinically suspected and culture-confirmed cases of omphalitis, respectively, were 379 and 130 per 1000 live births. Gram-positive (GPB) and Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were detected in 50.4% (n = 71) and 49.6% (n = 70) of cases, respectively. The often isolated bacteria were S. aureus, 53.5% (n = 38), and E. coli, 47.1% (n = 33); GNB were highly resistant (> 60%) to tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and ampicillin. The overall multi-drug resistance was 34.7% (n = 49); methicillin-resistant S. aureus was 34.1% (n = 14). The GNB isolates comprised extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, 15.7% (n = 11), and carbapenemase, 10% (n = 7) producers. The lack of hand washing practices [AOR = 2.08, (95% CI 1.26-3.41), P value = 0.004] and lower gestation period (< 37 weeks) [AOR = 2.3, (95% CI 1.33-3.93), P value = 0.003] were statistically associated. The overall prevalence of omphalitis was higher; WHO-prioritised drug-resistant bacterial pathogens were also detected. This study underscores the importance of factors such as maternal/caregiver hand hygiene and antenatal care. Thus, a more comprehensive approach towards the management of omphalitis employing precise diagnostic tools and an antimicrobial stewardship program is essential in all the four study settings.",

  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is an escalating global concern, necessitating the development of novel antibiotics with unique mechanisms of action, and preferably also with a lowered propensity for resistance development. Type-I Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) systems that are ubiquitous in bacterial genomes consist of a genetic toxin element encoding a hydrophobic peptide and an antitoxin element producing an sRNA that inhibits the toxin translation. Although the biological roles of these membrane-associated toxins remain incompletely understood, their inherent lethality upon overexpression suggests a potential as antimicrobial agents. In this study, we explore the ShoB toxin from the shoB-ohsC TA system in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a basis for designing synthetic antimicrobial peptides for exogenous delivery. We demonstrate that ShoB-derived peptides can retain antimicrobial efficacy when modified into shorter, cationic analogs with enhanced solubility. Our most promising hits exhibit rapid bactericidal action and frequency of resistance within E. coli cultures indicate a limited tendency for resistance development. These findings highlight that type-I TA systems constitute a novel source of potential peptide-based antibiotics, thereby offering an alternative largely unexplored strategy to combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.",

  "abstract": "To review the evidence for changes in antibiotic resistance patterns before and after cataract surgery since the advent of routine use of intracameral (IC) antibiotic prophylaxis and development of newer topical fluoroquinolones pre- and postcataract surgery. Literature searches in the National Library of Medicine PubMed database were conducted between 2019 and 2021 and updated in 2024. There were no date restrictions, and the search was limited to high-quality studies published in English. The initial combined searches yielded 583 articles, and the search update in 2024 yielded 9 articles. Of these 592 articles, 26 presented original research that met specified inclusion criteria. Reviewed studies were rated based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine grading system. Because results from the various studies are not directly comparable due to the use of different antibiotics, different methods, different study populations and different outcomes, formal analyses for heterogeneity of results and publication bias were not performed. There were no studies that presented definitive level I evidence for increased bacterial resistance to IC or oral antibiotics prior to or during routine cataract surgery. There were no studies that provided level I evidence for increased bacterial resistance to topical administration of antibiotics. One study showed level III evidence for potential antibiotic resistance when the antibiotic was administered for greater than 1 month, and four level III studies showed a possible trend towards increased moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin resistance. There is little evidence of increased bacterial resistance following the use of newer fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis prior to cataract surgery or the routine use of IC antibiotic prophylaxis during cataract surgery. Our work is limited by the lack of high-level evidence on antibiotic resistance. Many studies reviewed are not randomised controlled trial (RCTs), introducing biases and confounding factors. Small sample sizes further reduce reliability, and uncontrolled variables, such as regional prescribing patterns, may lead to misleading results. While lower level evidence offers some insights, cautious interpretation is advised until more rigorous RCTs are conducted.",

  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistome of gut microbiota can be transmitted into the urban ecosystems via fecal pollution, potentially leading to a public health crisis. It is essential to determine the primary sources of fecal contamination and accurately evaluate the health risks for the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from the intestinal microbiota. In this research, the occurrence, sources and potential hosts of ARGs in urban environmental samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), natural water bodies, tap water and farmland soil were comprehensively investigated. Host-associated fecal indicators for general warm-blooded animals (BacGeneral), humans (crAssphage), and other animals (bovines and swine) were employed for reliable microbial source tracking (MST). Results showed that the fecal indicator BacGeneral was detected in 84.00 % of collected environmental samples, indicating the widespread fecal contamination in local water and farmland. The WWTP was the reservoir and main source of fecal contamination in local environment, harboring the highest total abundances of ARGs (3.85 ± 2.72 ARGs/16S rRNA) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (0.32 ± 0.12 MGEs/16S rRNA) from multiple animals and humans. Although the swine-associated indicator was undetected, fecal contamination from both bovines and humans was prevalent in collected samples, with detection rates of pollution indicators at 52.00 % for bovine and 28.00 % for human sources. The co-occurrence of ARGs, fecal indicators and MGEs was analyzed, and significant correlation (P < 0.01) between total ARG abundance and fecal indicator (BacGeneral) in contaminated environments demonstrated that fecal pollution exhibited a great influence on overall resistome in local environment. This research offers a comprehensive understanding of the sources and dissemination of ARGs in feces-polluted urban environments, providing data for the monitoring and prevention of ARG pollution.",

  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae infections presents significant challenges in treating lung inflammation. To overcome tissue penetration barriers and modulate inflammatory responses, innovative therapeutic approaches are essential. This study introduces an inhalable nanoplatform, Fe S :Gd@PVP (FGP), based on polyvinylpyrrolidone-modified gadolinium-doped nonstoichiometric iron sulfide nanostructures. The platform integrates synergistic magnetic-ultrasound activation with magnetothermal therapy (mMHT), sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and gas therapy (GT) for targeted bacterial lung infection treatment. Gadolinium incorporation enhances the magnetothermal activation, improving magnetothermal conversion efficiency and sonodynamic performance by increasing magnetic anisotropy, narrowing the semiconductor bandgap, and enriching sulfur vacancies. Delivered via nebulized inhalation, FGP reaches infected lung tissues noninvasively. Exposure to alternating magnetic fields (AMF) and ultrasound (US) generates localized heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS), effectively eliminating bacteria. Simultaneously, AMF and US trigger hydrogen sulfide (H S) release in the acidic microenvironment, reducing inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and IL-1β through suppression of STAT3 and ERK phosphorylation. This magnetic-ultrasound co-activated inhalable nanoplatform offers a powerful multimodal therapeutic strategy for overcoming clinical challenges associated with bacterial lung infections. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bacterial lung infections caused by multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae pose significant treatment challenges due to poor antibiotic efficacy and uncontrolled inflammation. This study presents an inhalable nanoplatform that combines magnetothermal therapy, sonodynamic therapy, and gas therapy to eradicate bacteria while reducing inflammation. By leveraging gadolinium-doped iron sulfide nanostructures, the system enhances heat generation, reactive oxygen species production, and hydrogen sulfide release, effectively targeting deep lung infections. Unlike conventional antibiotics, this approach offers precise, noninvasive treatment with minimal side effects, addressing both bacterial clearance and inflammatory regulation. The proposed strategy provides a promising alternative for treating antibiotic-resistant lung infections and may inspire broader applications of multifunctional nanomedicine in respiratory disease management.",

  "abstract": "Efflux pumps in Pseudomonas aeruginosa play an important role in decreasing the bacterium's antibiotic susceptibility. This study aimed to identify P. aeruginosa efflux pumps and examine the effect of Zinc sulfate on these pumps. This study was conducted on 104 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from different types of specimens. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of all isolates was examined by disc diffusion and microdilution methods. A Cartwheel test was done for phenotypic detection of P. aeruginosa efflux pumps in the presence and absence of zinc sulfate. The expression of efflux pumps encoding genes and their regulators in the presence and absence of zinc sulfate was measured using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. A high rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pattern was observed among the tested isolates (55.7%). Combining different antibiotics with Zinc sulfate exhibited synergistic effects against most of the studied isolates. The addition of sub-inhibitory concentrations of Zinc sulfate to the cartwheel test was found to inhibit efflux pump activity in all tested isolates. The expression of the positive regulator gene, mexT, was significantly decreased. Additionally, Zinc sulfate significantly upregulated the expression of the mexR gene (P-value < 0.05), a negative regulator of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump. Zinc sulfate demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. We recommend the use of Zinc sulfate as an antibiotic adjuvant and efflux pump inhibitor in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections to enhance the bacterium's susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.",

  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance continues to pose a significant global challenge associated with increased rates of illness and death. The emergence of multidrug resistance patterns in pathogenic bacteria poses a challenge in their treatment, rendering them unmanageable with traditional antibiotics in the foreseeable future. Thus, prioritising innovative pharmaceuticals for therapy and exploring alternate approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance is of utmost importance. Endophytic bacteria derived from medicinal plants are reservoirs of active therapeutic compounds, offering a promising alternative for discovering novel and therapeutically bioactive compounds. This work involved the isolation and identification of four endophytic bacteria from Combretum erythrophyllum. The antibacterial activity and metabolic profiling of the secondary metabolite extract were assessed via the microdilution technique and gas chromatography data analysis, respectively. The assessed extract showed wide-ranging effectiveness against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with a particular preference for Klebsiella aerogenes (ATCC 27853) at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 125 µg/mL. The analysed secondary metabolites revealed phytochemicals, namely terpenoids, ketones, phytosterols, phenols, alkanes, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as the bioactive constituents. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of the endophytic bacteria of C. erythrophyllum as a potential source of active natural bioactive compounds for antibiotic therapy.",

  "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of today's leading public health issues worldwide. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) dapagliflozin recently received a label expansion. It is now approved for treatment of HF across the entire spectrum of ejection fraction (EF) in Germany. However, real-world data are limited. EVOLUTION-HF DE  aims to complement existing data in Germany under the multinational umbrella EVOLUTION-HF study protocol. EVOLUTION-HF DE  (NCT06336330) is a non-interventional, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. It is planned to enrol a total of 1000 (700 evaluable) patients with HF in Germany. Distribution is planned as 40% patients with preserved (HFpEF), 20% with mildly reduced (HFmrEF), and 40% with reduced EF (HFrEF). Patients ≥18 years of age, who started dapagliflozin treatment 14-90 days prior to enrolment according to the local product label, are eligible to participate. Among reasons for exclusion are previous SGLT2i treatment (including dapagliflozin), type 1 diabetes, and hypersensitivity to dapagliflozin or its excipients. Data on medical history, HF status and medication before dapagliflozin treatment will be collected retrospectively at baseline. Follow-up data will concern clinical symptoms, healthcare utilization, HF and concomitant medication, as well as dapagliflozin usage. These data will be extracted from real-world data sources like patient charts, discharge letters, and electronic medical records. They will be collected prospectively every 3 months for up to 12 months. In addition, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), medication adherence, work productivity, and patient's needs, expectations, and satisfaction with medical care will be collected using standardized and unstandardized questionnaires. Primary objectives include demographic and clinical characterization of patients and the assessment of treatment patterns of dapagliflozin, other HF medications, and glucose-lowering medications. Secondary objectives are to describe HRQoL, medication adherence, and work productivity. Exploratory objectives are to describe depression, healthcare utilization, and patient's needs, expectations, and satisfaction with medical care. EVOLUTION-HF DE  has included its first patient in April 2024 and is currently open for enrolment. EVOLUTION-HF DE  will deliver relevant insights into real-world dapagliflozin treatment for HF focusing on clinical and patient perspective in Germany.",

  "abstract": "This study investigates the physicochemical properties, heavy metal concentrations, and bacterial profiles of contaminated scrapyard soils compared to fertile agricultural soil. The results indicate that scrapyard soils exhibit higher bulk density (1.10 1.30 g/cm³), lower organic carbon (0.80 1.10%), and reduced organic matter (1.37 1.90%) levels, suggesting deterioration in soil fertility. Electrical conductivity is significantly elevated (0.70 0.80 dS/m), indicating increased ionic strength. Heavy metal analysis reveals significantly higher concentrations of Pb (14 18 mg/kg), Cd (3 7 mg/kg), Zn (20 40 mg/kg), Cu (23 35 mg/kg), Ni (23 30 mg/kg), and As (3.85 5.5 mg/kg). Bacterial loads in scrapyard soils (3.08 3.76 Log CFU/g) are considerably lower than in control soil (7.88 Log CFU/g), alongside decreased soil enzyme activities, including dehydrogenase (130 170 µg TPF/g/h), urease (110 130 µg NH₄⁺/g/h), phosphatase (70-90 µg pNP/g/h), and catalase (85-95 µg O₂/g/h). The study isolates Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Klebsiella aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas reactans, and Bacillus subtilis, which exhibit varying resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals. A strong correlation is observed between heavy metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance (r = 0.78 0.88, P < 0.05), suggesting a synergistic effect where metal exposure enhances bacterial resilience to antibiotics. Notably, the MICs of tetracycline and ampicillin increase substantially in Cd-exposed isolates (up to 35 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL, respectively), while Ni exposure in Pseudomonas reactans results in a two-fold increase in the MIC of chloramphenicol (from 10.5 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL). The correlation between soil enzyme activity and dominant bacterial species further highlights the influence of heavy metal contamination on microbial function. These findings underscore the environmental risks posed by scrapyard contamination and the adaptive mechanisms of multi-resistant bacteria in response to heavy metal stress.",

  "abstract": "Patients with severe mental disorder and diabetes may be exposed to inappropriate polypharmacy increasing the risk of side effects and drug interactions. Although medication reviews may facilitate short-term deprescribing, they are not known to affect clinical outcomes. We investigated whether implementing physician-led medication reviews through interdisciplinary dialogue can change prescription patterns and improve pharmacological efficacy and tolerability in psychiatric outpatients with diabetes. Included in the study were 52 patients from an endocrinologist-psychiatrist outpatient clinic in Slagelse Region, Zealand, Denmark. Patients were allocated to an intervention group, where patients' pharmacological treatment was discussed at an interdisciplinary treatment conference based on a medication review conducted by a specialist in clinical pharmacology or a control group receiving standard care. All patients underwent psychometric testing, side effect screening, clinical interviews, and had drug regimens and biochemical test results extracted from the electronic health records at baseline and at 6 months follow up. The trial was completed by 48 patients. Average time to follow up was 7 months (range 5-11 months). The intervention group had a median reduction of 1 drug (interquartile range [IQR] -4.00, 0.00) and 1 potentially inappropriate prescription (IQR -2.00, 0.00) compared to a median increase of 2 drugs (IQR 1.00, 3.00) and 2 potentially inappropriate prescriptions (IQR 0.00, 3.00) in the control group. The usage of both somatic and psychiatric drugs was reduced. We found no differences in clinical outcomes. Deprescribing can be achieved without worsening psychiatric symptoms in psychiatric outpatients by implementing physician-led medication reviews through interdisciplinary dialogue. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT (05243160).",

  "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major global health threat due to its remarkable ability of resistance, persistence in hostile environments and tolerance to stress conditions. Phenylacetic acid (PAA) catabolism, traditionally known for bacterial metabolic advantage, is now being investigated for its role in the pathogenesis of A. baumannii. This study aims to explore how PAA and its metabolic processes influence the virulence factors and antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii MCC 2076. We examined growth kinetics and PAA utilization to assess the time-dependent breakdown of PAA. In vitro analyses were conducted to evaluate biofilm formation, bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and tolerance to desiccation stress in PAA-catabolizing cells. Our findings revealed a two-fold increase in biofilm formation and an 8% enhancement in bacterial surface adherence. Additionally, we observed an increase in efflux pump activity and a decrease in outer membrane permeability when PAA served as a carbon source. All these factors may be responsible for 2- to 3-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. A. baumannii cells with an active paa operon demonstrated a higher survival rate under desiccation stress compared to control cells. RT-qPCR analysis indicated the upregulation of genes such as gacA, csuE, ompA, and adeR, which are associated with virulence related genes like biofilm forming, adherence and antibiotic resistance related genes. The catabolism of PAA is crucial, as its utilization significantly alters the virulence characteristics of A. baumannii MCC 2076. This study provides valuable insights into the PAA catabolic pathway's role in modulating virulence gene expression, potentially offering new therapeutic targets for combating A. baumannii infections.",

  "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a well-known complication of diabetes. The main therapeutic options for treating DFU include surgical debridement. However, conditions such as sensory loss and insufficient blood supply can lead to lower extremity amputations. Inflammatory biomarkers, including the neutrophil‒lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet‒lymphocyte ratio (PLR), have shown promise in predicting the development of diabetes complications. This study included 126 individuals with known DFUs who underwent amputation or debridement surgery during hospitalization between January 2017 and December 2022. The participants were divided into two groups, each containing 63 patients, based on the treatment they received. Analyses were conducted via univariate and multivariate regression models. The linearity of the relationship between each inflammatory index and the risk of amputation was further examined via restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves with four knots. Categorical regression analysis showed an elevated risk of amputation in patients with an NLR greater than 6.08, with an OR of 13.090 (95% CI: 5.143-33.320, P < 0.001), compared with those with an NLR less than 6.08. Additionally, patients with a PLR greater than 210 demonstrated a similarly elevated risk of amputation with an OR of 2.31 (95% CI: 1.066‒4.669, P = 0.033); however, those with lymphocyte‒white blood cell ratio (LWR) levels of greater than 0.1265 exhibited reduced likelihood of having amputation (OR: 0.092 (95% CI: 0.038‒0.226, P < 0.001)). This study supports that NLR, PLR and LWR may have value as a predictive marker for amputation in patients with DFUs.",

  "abstract": "Afforestation has emerged as a nature-based strategy for climate mitigation and urban sustainability, yet its effects on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils remain underexplored. This study investigates how the conversion of croplands into plantation forests affects the soil resistome, bacterial communities, and physicochemical properties in an urban environment. Using high-throughput metagenomic and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we analyzed soil samples from croplands and afforested plots with Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) and Chinese scholar (Sophora japonica) trees, across two-time points post-afforestation. Our results show that afforestation promotes the convergence of both bacterial and ARG communities over time, accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative abundance of human pathogenic bacteria. Afforested soils exhibited a lower prevalence of high-risk ARGs (e.g., qnrA, qnrB from the quinolone class) and reduced co-occurrence between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), particularly transposases and recombinases, suggesting diminished horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, afforestation-induced changes in soil pH and nutrient dynamics emerged as key ecological factors shaping ARG profiles. Differences between afforestation types were also observed, with Pinus plantations presenting lower ARG-derived risks than Sophora forests. This study supports afforestation as a nature-based solution for enhancing urban sustainability, reducing public health risks, and achieving resilient ecosystems under anthropogenic influence.",

  "abstract": "This study systematically compares the risk of long-term ocular adverse events between subcutaneous and oral semaglutide preparations to assess pathway-specific safety differences. In this study, the Report odds ratio (ROR) technique was employed to detect signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of semaglutide. Analysis was conducted on data extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from 2004(Q1) through 2024(Q3). This investigation encompasses a descriptive analysis focused on the administration of semaglutide through various routes, encompassing a broad range of demographics including gender (male and female), age groups, along with other demographic data and the timing of disease onset. Following this, the study employs the ROR methodology to assess the differential adverse event signals across distinct semaglutide formulations. We categorized the eye as the System Organ Class (SOC) and obtained 1733 ADE reports related to it from the FAERS database. Of these, 1541 reports were associated with injectables, while tablets were linked to 192 ADE reports. In both dosage forms, most cases occurred within the first month of administration, although the median time to onset (TTO) differed, with injectables identified at 7.00 [IQR 0.00-56.00] days and tablets at only 3.50 [IQR 0.00-35.00] days. It is worth noting that 5.41% of patients administered subcutaneous injections and 2.17% of those receiving oral medications reported ADEs following one year of treatment with semaglutide. Furthermore, female patients exhibited a higher susceptibility to ocular adverse reactions compared to their male counterparts. Regarding the primary preferred terms (PTs), blurred vision constitutes 34.33% of the total ADEs associated with tablet formulations. This incidence is marginally higher than that observed with injectable formulations. This investigation further discerned ocular ADEs signals associated with specific formulations: subcutaneous injections have a higher frequency of reports concerning retinal complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, retinal tear, and retinal hemorrhage. The results of this study identified a significant difference between subcutaneous and oral semaglutide in ocular ADE risk, providing some evidence for dosage form selection and risk monitoring for clinical use.",

  "abstract": "Hospital wastewater (HWW) is a substantial environmental reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and poses risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. However, research on the diversity, transmission mechanisms, pathogenic hosts, and risks of ARGs in different HWW types is limited. This study involved the collection of HWW samples from 15 hospitals in Hefei, China, which were subsequently categorized as general hospitals (GHs) and non-general hospitals (NGHs). A 280.28-Gbp sequencing dataset was generated using a metagenomic sequencing strategy and analyzed using metagenomic assembly and binning approaches to highlight these issues in GHs and NGHs. Results showed significant differences between GHs and NGHs in ARG distribution, microbial community composition, and hosts of ARGs. Potential pathogens such as Rhodocyclaceae bacterium ICHIAU1 and Acidovorax caeni were more abundant in GHs. Furthermore, plasmid-mediated ARGs (45.21%) were more prevalent than chromosome-mediated ARGs (25.74%) in HWW, with a significantly higher proportion of plasmid-mediated ARGs in GHs compared to NGHs. The co-occurrence of ARGs and mobile genetic elements was more frequent in GHs. Additionally, the antibiotic resistome risk index was higher in GHs (38.73 ± 12.84) than NGHs (22.53 ± 11.80), indicating a greater risk of ARG transmission in GHs. This pioneering study provides valuable insights into the transmission mechanisms and hosts of ARGs in hospital settings, emphasizing the increased risk of ARG transmission in GHs.",

  "abstract": "Bloodstream infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis are among the most frequent and serious infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), being responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality. However, how S. epidermidis prevails, disseminates and evolves to cause outbreaks in NICU is poorly understood. We aimed to understand what is the genomic basis of S. epidermidis outbreaks in NICU to provide guidelines for a better infection control. We collected all S. epidermidis isolated from newborn blood cultures admitted to a hospital NICU in Brazil over one-year and compared their genomes. The S. epidermidis infection incidence rate was 1.17 per baby-year. 83.64% of S. epidermidis were resistant to methicillin (MRSE) and 84.5% belonged to sequence type 2 (ST2) or related, carrying the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type III or IVa. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis showed that S. epidermidis infections resulted from the co-existence of three ST2 transmission chains originating from distinct endemic sources (<50 SNPs). Each transmission chain was characterized by specific antibiotic resistance and virulence profile and content in staphylococcal cassette chromosome elements (SCCmec, SCC non-mec and ACME). During transmission, other mobile genetic elements were acquired/lost and mutations emerged in genes involved in adhesion, signal transduction, general metabolism, replication, recombination and repair. Tracking S. epidermidis transmission chains in the NICU will require a deep genomic analysis, combining bacterial genetic background and accessory genome. This study highlighted the need for the integration of whole genome sequencing as a key surveillance tool for infection control in NICUs.",

Retrospective cohort study. Electronic health records. A total number of 88 306 patients with MASLD and T2DM were included in a propensity score-matched analysis comparing the effects of anti-diabetic drugs. Patients were categorized into groups based on their initiation of anti-diabetic medications. The primary outcomes were the incidence of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensations, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary outcomes were a progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), severity of CKD stages, and the need for hemodialysis. In the SGLT2i versus DPP4i, a reduced risk of cirrhosis was observed in the SGLT2i (HR: 0.97), along with fewer hepatic decompensations (HR: 0.84) and a lower incidence of HCC (HR: 0.50). CKD progression, particularly to stages 4-5, was significantly lower in the SGLT2i (HR: 0.53), as was hemodialysis (HR: 0.38). However, SGLT2i exhibited a slightly lower risk of CKD progression (HR: 0.77) and a reduced need for hemodialysis (HR: 0.71) compared to the GLP-1RA, while there was no difference in hepatic outcomes between the GLP-1RA and SGLT2i. SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with MASLD and T2DM demonstrated reduced risks of liver complications and a favorable impact on renal outcomes. These findings support the preferential consideration of SGLT2i in managing this patient population, particularly for mitigating the progression of liver and kidney diseases.",

  "abstract": "The continued development of novel antimicrobial treatment strategies is crucial for maintaining an effective therapeutic arsenal, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exhibit promising activities against a wide range of pathogens. In this study, we tested the combined effects of an AMP, TP4-3, and meropenem on Acinetobacter baumannii, which is responsible for many severe infections and is associated with high rates of overall mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to develop an effective combination therapy for microbial infections. TP4-3 and meropenem were found to act synergistically toward Acinetobacter baumannii and exhibit an activity profile better than those of the individual compounds. TP4-3 is an antimicrobial peptide with proven activity, low toxicity and extended stability. This AMP was combined with meropenem and tested for efficacy against A. baumannii using a panel of in vitro and in vivo tests. The combination of TP4-3 and meropenem exhibited robust activity against Acinetobacter baumannii pathogens. In particular, the combined treatment demonstrated significant antibiofilm properties and a lower degree of induced resistance than meropenem alone. Additionally, the combination showed an excellent activity profile in in vivo studies. Thus, the combination of TP4-3 and meropenem appears to be an effective strategy to mitigate the detrimental consequences of infections caused by this clinically relevant pathogen. Since the combination of TP4-3 and meropenem displayed better activity than the individual compounds, this strategy of combining AMPs with clinical antibiotics may be suitable for development of clinical treatments targeting various microbial infections.",

This study suggests that bariatric surgery may be similarly effective in patients with BD and SCZ, offering potential benefits for a population burdened with both psychiatric and physical health challenges.",

  "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease begins early, and prophylactic antibiotics have been used to prevent Staphylococcus aureus infection. This study examined the lung microbiome in two countries with differing antibiotic practices and its relationship to lung function in young children with CF. A binational, longitudinal, observational study was performed to define the lower airway microbiome in infants with CF. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed using lavage fluid to characterize the lung microbiota in 45 infants with and without prophylactic antibiotic therapy at an average age of approximately 3 months and 14 months. The association between pulmonary function, bacterial community diversities, and taxa was assessed. Expected CF bacterial genera and non-traditional bacteria, such as Streptococcus, were identified as core taxa. Microbial community shifts were observed in infants who received antibiotic prophylaxis, with lower alpha diversity (ANOVA, P<0.05) and a higher proportion of Streptococcus at the first visit. Beta diversity (FEV z; MiRKAT, P<0.05) and Streptococcus were associated with FEV z (LASSO and linear regression, β<0). Functional annotation suggested that alteration of lung microbiota may be linked to antimicrobial resistance. Lung microbial diversity in infants with CF varied between the two countries, particularly during early infancy. A shift in the lung microbiome toward a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus was associated with reduced pulmonary function.",

Demographic data, comorbidities, preoperative factors including history of previous surgery, history of injection, laboratory data including preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count, isolated pathogens from synovial fluid culture, and Gachter stage were analyzed. Statistical analyses using univariate and logistic regression were performed. Out of 132 patients, 17 patients (12.9%) had more than one additional arthroscopic debridement. History of diabetes mellitus (DM) ( <0.001), previous injection ( =0.041), isolated   in synovial fluid ( =0.010), and high Gachter stage ( =0.002) were identified as risk factors, whereas age, history of previous knee surgery at the affected knee, CRP level, preoperative WBC, and preoperative neutrophil count of synovial fluid had no significant relation. Logistic regression analysis showed significant increase of risk in patients with DM [odds ratio (OR) 12.002, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.243-44.418,  <0.001], previous injection history (OR 4.812, 95% CI 1.367-16.939,  =0.017), and isolation of   in synovial fluid (OR 4.804, 95% CI 1.282-18.001,  =0.031) as independent risk factors for failure of infection eradication after single arthroscopic debridement. Comorbidity of DM, history of previous injection, isolated   in synovial fluid, and high Gachter stage were associated with a higher risk of failure to eradicate infection with a single arthroscopic procedure.

This study aimed to develop a nanoformulation (Mal-AuNP-Gel) by synthesizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with maltol (Mal), and coating them with fish gelatin (Gel) to reduce biofilm formation and virulence characteristics of microbial pathogens. Mal-AuNP-Gel showed increased antibacterial activity against all pathogens studied, including bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and fungal pathogens (e.g., Candida albicans), with MICs up to 2-fold lower than those of Mal-AuNPs. At the sub-MIC level, Mal-AuNPs-Gel, compared to Mal-AuNPs, improved the inhibition of initial-stage biofilm development by a single species of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and C. albicans as well as the mixed-species biofilm of S. aureus and C. albicans. Additionally, these nanoparticles significantly inhibited several virulence characteristics such as hemolysis, pyoverdine and pyocyanin production, protease activity, and motility of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the expression of genes associated with biofilm formation, quorum sensing, motility, and virulence factors in P. aeruginosa was found to be suppressed by Mal-AuNPs-Gel at a higher level than that of Mal-AuNPs, corroborating the phenotypic effects. The non-cytotoxic effects of Mal-AuNPs and Mal-AuNPs-Gel at sub-MIC levels, as evidenced by results of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo phytotoxicity tests, further indicated biocompatibility of the synthesized nanoparticles.",

A DKD model was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). High glucose (HG)-stimulated HK-2 cells served as an in vitro model. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in kidney tissues were measured using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. ELISA was performed to measure MDA, SOD, and GSH in both rat tissues and HK-2 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses evaluated renal fibrosis, the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, LC3I/II, P62). Hirsutine treatment significantly improved metabolic and renal parameters in rats, enhancing renal function and reducing fibrosis, as shown by lower levels of Vimentin, Collagen-IV, and α-SMA. It alleviated oxidative stress, indicated by reduced ROS and MDA levels and increased SOD and GSH activity. Additionally, hirsutine enhanced autophagy, reflected by higher Beclin 1 and LC3I/II levels and decreased P62 expression. By disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, hirsutine increased Nrf2 levels and upregulated antioxidative enzymes like NQO1, SOD-2, and HO-1. Hirsutine exhibited renoprotective effects in DKD by modulating the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, mitigating oxidative stress and promoting autophagy, making it a promising candidate for treatment.",

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a representative adverse event associated with gemcitabine plus nab-PTX (GnP) in patients with pancreatic cancer. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. We aimed to assess whether the enhancement effect of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the development of CIPN for GnP. This study evaluated 27 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging prior to GnP treatment. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement on hepato-biliary images, was measured. Plasma concentrations of paclitaxel at 0.5, 6, and 24 h after first administration were also determined in 13 patients. Sixteen of the twenty-seven patients (59.3 %) developed ≥ grade 1 CIPN during the first 8 weeks. We found a negative relationship between the CEI and area under the plasma concentration curve of PTX (r = -0.729, p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, a CEI <1.84 and concomitant diabetes mellitus were independent predictors of CIPN development (hazard ratio, 5.37, p = 0.027; hazard ratio, 3.68, p = 0.012, respectively).

However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota is involved in the genesis of chronic itch, a refractory condition that afflicts patients both physically and mentally. Here, we report that depletion of gut microbiota enhances tolerance to itch in mice orally administered with antibiotics (ABX) and mice free of germ. Of note, oral gavage with   ( ), a prominent species of the genus   with most differential change, corrected the ABX-induced itch dysfunction through its driven metabolite acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC). Mechanistically, gut microbiota or   depletion caused a decrease in RNA N6-methyladenosine (m A) demethylase FTO expression in the dorsal horn and a consequent increase in RNA m A sites in Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor F ( ) mRNA, leading to decreased MRGPRF protein. The downregulation of FTO was triggered by inactivation of ETS proto-oncogene 1 (ETS1), a transcription factor that binds to the   promoter. These findings support a gut microbe - spinal connection in modulation of itch sensation in RNA m A epigenetic-dependent manner and highlight a critical role of ALC in linking the altered   and itch dysfunction.",

Although estrogen deprivation is a known risk factor for AD in females, the impact of androgen deprivation on AD pathology in males, particularly regarding neuroinflammation, remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of long-term systemic androgen deprivation on AD pathology, including glial cell-specific gene expression, amyloid β (Aβ) pathology, and cognitive function in male castrated App  (App) mice. We found significantly reduced androgen receptor (AR/Ar) expression levels in the precunei of male patients with early AD pathology and isolated brain microglia of male App mice compared with their nonpathological controls. In castrated App mice, microglial Tnf and Il6 and astrocytic Socs3 were downregulated, indicating that androgens may promote inflammation in the brain. However, Aβ accumulation and cognitive function were unaffected. These results suggest that although systemic androgen deprivation modulates neuroinflammation, the changes are insufficient to alter the AD phenotype or pathology in male App mice.",

This study aimed to evaluate the safety outcomes of propafenone use in atrial fibrillation patients with heart failure when compared to those of amiodarone use. This population-based cohort study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Eligible patients were those who had atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter diagnosis, had heart failure diagnosis, and first received propafenone or amiodarone between 2002 and 2018. The primary endpoints were death due to arrhythmia and the composite proarrhythmic outcome, which consisted of sudden cardiac arrest, arrhythmic death, ventricular arrhythmia and implantation of defibrillator. After propensity score matching, the study cohort consisted of 7235 propafenone and 14 470 amiodarone users. Compared to amiodarone, propafenone was associated with significantly lower risk of the composite proarrhythmic outcome (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.64; P < .001). Propafenone users also had lower risk of death owing to arrhythmia compared to amiodarone users (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.65; P = .006). Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis showed similar trends, favouring propafenone. Propafenone was not significantly associated with increased risk of proarrhythmia and mortality when compared to amiodarone in atrial fibrillation patients with heart failure in contemporary real-world settings.

  "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant genetic disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration and phenotypic variability. MJD/SCA3, the most prevalent form around the world and in Latin America, is also likely the most common hereditary ataxia in Uruguay. Despite its relevance, Uruguay lacks comprehensive epidemiological studies, and molecular diagnostics remain inaccessible in public health systems. This review provides a phenotypic description on genetically confirmed patients with MJD/SCA3 as a first step towards generating knowledge on this matter in our country. A retrospective review of 37 Uruguayan patients with suspected SCA was conducted. Sixteen patients with confirmed molecular diagnosis of MJD/SCA3 were included on this review. Data collected encompassed demographic information, genetic testing results, clinical manifestations, and imaging findings. Patients were evaluated at the Ataxias Polyclinic, Hospital de Clínicas, between 2019 and 2024 by the authors. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29.0. The mean age of symptom onset was 41.75 years, with gait ataxia as the initial symptom in 87.5% of cases. Clinical findings included appendicular ataxia (100%), dysarthria (90%), and oculomotor alterations (90%), with diverse deep sensitivity impairment in 62.5%. Genetic testing revealed an average of 72.9 CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene. Cerebellar atrophy was observed in 75% of patients with MRI. Most had a diagnostic delay of 6.5 years and an autosomal dominant family history. Findings align with international descriptions of MJD/SCA3 while highlighting regional characteristics, including a potential genetic link with southern Brazil. The absence of dysautonomia, typically prevalent in MJD/SCA3, suggests underdiagnosis or insufficient evaluation. This study underscores the need for systematic clinical and molecular evaluations in Uruguay and serves as a foundation to understand hereditary ataxias at a national level. Further research is essential for improving diagnosis and management of this complex pathology.",

CeD onset results from a multifaceted interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While recent data show that alterations in gut microbiome composition could play an important role, many current studies are constrained by small sample sizes and limited resolution. To address these limitations, we analyzed fecal gut microbiota from two Dutch cohorts, CeDNN (128 treated CeD patients (tCeD), 106 controls) and the Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project (24 self-reported tCeD, 654 controls), using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Self-reported IBS (570 cases, 1710 controls) and IBD (93 cases, 465 controls) were used as comparative conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Interindividual variation within the case and control groups was calculated at whole microbiome and strain level. Finally, species-specific gene repertoires were analyzed in tCeD patients and controls. Within-individual microbiome diversity was decreased in patients with self-reported IBS and IBD but not in tCeD patients. Each condition displayed a unique microbial pattern and, in addition to confirming previously reported microbiome associations, we identify an increase in the levels of  ,  , and  , amongst others. We further show that the observed changes can partially be explained by gluten-free diet adherence. We also observe increased interindividual variation of gut microbiome composition among tCeD patients and a higher bacterial mutation frequency in tCeD that contributes to higher interindividual variation at strain level. In addition, the immotile European subspecies of  , which has a distinct carbohydrate metabolism potential, was nearly absent in tCeD patients. Our study sheds light on the complex interplay between the gut microbiome and CeD, revealing increased interindividual variation and strain-level variation in tCeD patients.

However, nearly half of the patients (59/127, 46.5%) referred for lymph node resection did not undergo adequate lymphadenectomy. The prognosis of CSS cannot be improved by lymphadenectomy for most patients (T0-T1) who are referred for endoscopic therapy because of the low rate of lymph node metastasis.

Additionally, we assess the prevalence of congenital heart malformations (CHM) in NF-NS compared to 'classic' neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A 9-year, prospective, monocentric study was conducted, involving patients with NF1 pathogenic variants (PVs) and Noonan syndrome-like facial phenotype (NSLFP). Twenty-six patients were enrolled. NSLFP was categorized as 'suggestive' in 69% of cases and 'typical' in 31%. The presence of at least two facial abnormalities (e.g., low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, and ptosis) was consistently observed in 'typical' cases. Inter-rater concordance was substantial (0.65 [95% CI = 0.56; 0.74]), while concordance between clinicians and F2G was almost perfect at (0.821 [CI 95% = 0.625; 1.000]).

NF-NS is a distinct phenotypic variant of NF1, marked by NSLP with consistent facial features -, and frequent pectus excavatum. F2G demonstrated high diagnostic concordance, reinforcing its clinical utility.

Constraints were imposed to maintain the maximum treatment temperature below 60 [°C] and the tumor boundary at ∼ 43 [°C]. The controller was designed by performing an integrated system dynamic - finite element analysis. Finite element-bioheat transfer (FE-BHT) simulations were performed on a computational phantom developed from the imaging data of a de-identified human head divided into voxels representing the skull, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain, tumor, and ventricles. A uniform distribution of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in an ellipsoid was used to represent MNPs in the phantom tumor. The MNP distribution was subdivided into three domains to simulate the steerable spatially confined heating region during MNHT. Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC) were explored. Regions of the phantom tumor that were undertreated during the simulated MNHT were selectively heated by adjusting the heating volume to improve the tumor coverage index (CI; tumor volume ≥ CEM43 of 20 [min]). Results show that steerable spatially confined heating improves CI by ∼15%. MPC achieves CI of 80% faster than PID (67 [min] vs. 80 [min]). Simulations demonstrated the feasibility of automated control to deliver tumor conformal thermal doses using steerable spatially confined heating.",

This paper focuses on the recent research progress in motor assessment of NDDs driven by motion capture data.

Then, we comparatively analyzed the technical points and characteristics of the three types of methods from the aspects of data composition, data preprocessing, assessment methods, assessment purposes and effects. Finally, we discussed and prospected the development trends of NDDs motor assessment. 神经退行性疾病（NDDs）是一组异质性神经系统疾病，可引起中枢神经系统或外周神经系统中神经元的进行性损失，继而造成肢体运动能力的下降。动作捕捉作为一种高精度、高分辨率采集人体运动数据的技术，其驱动的NDDs运动评估可以有效提取运动特征，进而评估患者运动能力或疾病严重程度。本文围绕动作捕捉数据驱动的NDDs运动评估最新研究进展，在扼要介绍NDDs运动评估数据集的基础上，根据特征提取和处理的方式将评估方法分为三类：基于统计分析的NDDs运动评估方法、基于机器学习的NDDs运动评估方法和基于深度学习的NDDs运动评估方法。然后，从数据构成、数据预处理、评估方法、评估目的与评估效果方面对比分析了三类方法的技术要点和特点。最后，讨论并展望了NDDs运动评估的发展趋势。.",

  "abstract": "In 2022, the American Heart Association launched an updated algorithm for quantifying cardiovascular health (CVH), termed Life's Essential 8 (LE8). This new approach has been shown to be associated with various noncommunicable chronic diseases and mortality. However, LE8 did not take into consideration the importance of psychological health on CVH. Recently, a perspective article proposed Life's Crucial 9 (LC9), which would add psychological health as another component to LE8, as a novel metric to assess CVH. This study aims to investigate the association of LC9 with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. This study included 23,080 adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2018, and mortality was ascertained by linkage to National Death Index records through 31 December 2019. The LC9 scoring algorithm was categorized into low (0-49), moderate (50-79), and high (80-100) CVH. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic spline analysis were applied to evaluate the association of LC9 with mortality. During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, a total of 2,388 overall deaths were identified, covering 613 CVD deaths. Compared with adults with a low CVH score, those with a high CVH score had 52% (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.60) and 64% (0.36; 0.23-0.56) reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Similarly, a moderate CVH score was associated with 33% (0.67; 0.58-0.78) and 49% (0.51; 0.40-0.64) reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. The population-attributable fractions of high vs. moderate or low CVH score were 46.0% for all-cause mortality and 75.8% for CVD mortality. Elevated blood lipids, high body mass index, and poor sleep quality were the three major contributors to all-cause mortality, whereas nicotine exposure, unhealthy psychology, and elevated blood lipids were the three significant ones to CVD mortality. There were approximately negative linear dose-response relationships of total LC9 score with all-cause and CVD mortality. Adhering to a high LC9 score is related to a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. This new CVH definition shows promise as a primordial preventive strategy to reduce mortality rates.",

  "abstract": "Bloodstream infections (BSI) are among the most frequent infections in tumour patients. We analysed 123 tumour patients (105 retrospective, 18 prospective) with BSI. The most common underlying tumour diseases were acute leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (40%), followed by lymphomas (25%) and multiple myeloma (20%). BSI were more frequently caused by Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria (53% vs. 40%), including Escherichia coli (33%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (14%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). The median time to fever resolution was 3 days (range 1-30 days). Neither pathogen type, initial antibiotic treatment, nor key patient characteristics significantly affected fever resolution time. Non-susceptibility of the pathogen to empirical antibiotic treatment was linked to prolonged fever resolution (HR 0.53, 95%-CI 0.28-1.0, p = 0.04). The severity of neutropenia on admission had a significant impact on 60-day survival (HR 2.95, 95%-CI 1.10-7.93, p = 0.03). In contrast, such an effect on survival was not observed by the non-susceptibility of the pathogen to primary empirical antibiotic treatment (HR 2.12, 95%-CI 0.71-6.30, p = 0.18). Non-adherence or questionable adherence to antibiotic stewardship (ABS) recommendations (n = 42, 34%) correlated with delayed fever resolution (median 3 days vs. 4 days; p = 0.04) and was more frequent in retrospectively than in prospectively recorded patients (38% vs. 11%, p = 0.03). Gram-negative bacteria still predominate as BSI agents in tumour patients. Prospective evaluation of anti-infective management may enhance adherence to ABS recommendations.",

  "abstract": "Detection of atherosclerosis is essential to the management and prevention of life-threatening cardiovascular events. Although non-invasive imaging modalities, such as  F-sodium fluoride ( F-NaF),  F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) PET, and CT, visualize distinct hallmarks of atherosclerosis, there has yet to be a singular multi-cohort interrogation of their strengths and limitations. Thus, we focused on identifying the optimal approach for visualizing atherosclerosis at different stages of disease progression. In this study, 6-week-old, male, ApoE deficient mice (Apoe ) were placed on a high cholesterol diet for 12-20 weeks to induce calcific atherosclerotic disease. Age-matched, male, wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice fed with regular chow served as the control group. Mice were imaged at 12, 15, 18, and 20 weeks after starting their respective diets. To follow the progression of calcified atherosclerotic lesions, at each time point, in vivo,  F-NaF microPET/CT images were acquired 1 h and 3 h post tracer i.v. injection. In a separate cohort, in vivo  F-FDG PET/CT images were acquired at 3 and 5 h post tracer i.v. injection to follow inflammation as a result of progressive atherosclerotic lesion formation. High-resolution microCT images were acquired for all mice to visualize aorta calcification. After each imaging session, a subset (n = 3) was euthanized from each group and histological analysis of the aorta was performed to confirm disease progression. In this comparative study, within the same cohort,  F-NaF PET detected atherosclerotic calcification earlier than microCT. At both 1 and 3 h post-injection (p.i.), calcified lesions were clearly detected by  F-NaF with a six-fold higher signal in Apoe  compared to WT mice. Interestingly,  F-NaF signal peaked at week 18, whereas aortic CT signal progressively increased with a 13-, 16-, and 29-fold at 15, 18, and 20 weeks, respectively.  F-FDG arortic accumulation at weeks 12 and 15, were significantly greater in Apoe   mice than WT control when images were acquired at 5 h but not at 3 h p.i.. In contrast to histological analysis, at ≥ 16 weeks where inflammation is significantly elevated,  F-FDG was equivalent in Apoe  and WT control mice and significantly reduced with disease progression. Our results show that  F-NaF PET and  F-FDG PET are sensitive imaging modalities for the early detection of atherosclerotic lesions. However, both  F-NaF PET and high-resolution microCT prove to be effective methods for monitoring late-stage and progressive disease.",

  "abstract": "Cytarabine is a prodrug which is activated to cytarabine triphosphate (Ara-CTP) through a series of phosphorylation steps. For considerable leukemic cell death, high level of Ara-CTP is required. Sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) and Nucleotide diphosphate kinase-2 (NME2) are genes involved in Ara-CTP metabolism. To best of our knowledge, there are no similar studies focused on the association of different polymorphisms involved Ara-C metabolism on the response to induction chemotherapy among adult AML Egyptian patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of SAMHD1 rs28372906 and NME2 rs3744660 polymorphisms on AML complete remission rate (CR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) among adult AML Egyptian patients, after Ara-C based induction therapy. This study was a retrospective conducted at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Egypt. The patient group included 136 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML, while the control group included 48 healthy subjects. The clinical history of all studied patients was collected from patient records. Patients and controls were genotyped for NEM2 (rs3744660) and SAMHD1 (rs28372906) by using Taq Man Genotyping assay and Taq Man genotyping master mix (REF: 4,371,353, Applied Biosystems, USA). Real-time PCR assay was performed on Thermo Fisher Quant Studio™ 3. The Statistical Package for Social Science version 21.0 was used to analyze our data. Regarding the SAMHD1 (rs28372906) polymorphism, we did not find any genotype variations between patient, and control groups, where all of them were AA genotype. Regarding NME2 (rs3744660) polymorphism the statistical analysis reported significant association between D28 blasts and OS (P-value = 0.043), while the remaining initial patient characteristics and response to induction were not associated with OS. CR, DFS, and OS were not significantly associated to SAMHD1 rs28372906 and NME2 rs3744660 polymorphisms.",

  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are complex and devastating conditions of the central nervous system that profoundly impact quality of life. Given the limited treatment options available, there is a pressing need to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Oligonucleotides have emerged as key players in precision medicine for these disorders, but their potential is hindered by poor translocation across the blood-brain barrier. This review focuses on neurodegenerative disorders other than Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, which are widely reported in the literature, and aims to address the significant hurdles in oligonucleotide delivery for neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights recent advancements in CNS-targeting approaches, such as chemical conjugation, antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates, focused ultrasound, and viral and nanocarrier-based delivery systems. Each strategy's strengths and limitations are discussed, with potential solutions proposed for more effective treatments. Additionally, the review offers valuable insights into regulatory requirements and prospects for clinical translation, which are crucial for shaping the future of neurodegenerative therapies. By exploring these innovative approaches, the goal is to surmount challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier and develop more effective treatments, thereby enhancing the quality of life of the patients suffering from these debilitating conditions.",

Evidence-based exercise interventions targeting both risk factors are limited. We conducted a literature search across seven databases for relevant articles published through 05/07/24. Studies qualified if they involved: (a) PWH ≥ 18 years old who engage in unhealthy substance use; (b) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental designs; and (c) an exercise intervention. Two researchers independently completed the Cochrane Data Collection Form and Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. PROSPERO registry: CRD42023473582. Out of 6916 potentially qualifying studies, 46 underwent full-text review, and 7 studies qualified (6 pilot RCTs & 1 quasi-experimental). Most (k = 6) were conducted in the US. Sample sizes ranged from 16 to 73 participants and retention rates ranged from 42 to 100%. Interventions met at least 1x/week for 6-24 weeks and consisted of supervised progressive overload aerobic/resistance training (k = 3), home-based training with virtual behavioral counseling (k = 1), yoga (k = 2), and tai-chi with cognitive behavioral therapy (k = 1). Despite inconsistent assessment tools and outcomes measured, exercise interventions were significantly (p < 0.05) and positively associated with outcomes relating to improving HIV, substance use, physical activity, strength/fall risk, quality of life/stress, and pain relief. All studies were high quality with low risk of bias, safe, and feasible. Despite small sample sizes and heterogeneity across studies, evidence from this systematic review supports the use of exercise to improve a variety of health outcomes among PWH with unhealthy substance use.",

Genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, and smoking are risk factors that lead to the development of LC, and the ineffectiveness of existing treatments emphasizes the need for innovative approaches to therapy. Through its regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer stem cell maintenance, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling system is essential to advancing LC. This study offers a thorough examination of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in LC, emphasizing how miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), protein-coding genes, enzymes, and both natural and synthetic drugs affect this signaling. Recent research supports the dual function of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumor development and repression, which we describe. We also emphasize the therapeutic potential of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors despite issues including off-target effects and bioavailability. This study highlights the potential of focusing on Wnt/β-catenin signaling to enhance LC patient outcomes by combining computational studies with molecular insights.

  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders present a significant challenge to healthcare systems, mainly due to the limited availability of effective treatment options to halt or reverse disease progression. Endogenous steroids synthesized in the central nervous system, such as pregnenolone (PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), progesterone (PROG), and allopregnanolone (ALLO), have been identified as potential therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurosteroids such as ALLO, DHEA, and PROG, as well as their synthetic analogs like Ganaxolene, Fluasterone, and Olexoxime, offer promising effects for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Moreover, Brexanolone and Ganaxolone are synthetic steroids approved for the treatment of postpartum depression and epilepsy, respectively. Neurosteroids such as ALLO are crucial in modulating GABAergic neurotransmission and reducing neuroinflammation. These compounds enhance the activity of GABA-A receptors, leading to increased inhibitory signaling in the brain, which can help regulate mood, cognition, and neuroprotection. Small clinical trials and observational studies indicate that ALLO may have cognitive benefits, but no large-scale, definitive meta-analysis confirms a 20% improvement in AD patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological diseases due to the high-energy demand and sensitivity of neurons to oxidative stress. Reduced mitochondrial function leads to amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles accumulation in AD. In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the PINK1 or Parkin genes leads to energy deficiencies and the accumulation of toxic byproducts. Mutations in genes such as SOD1, C9orf72, and TDP-43 have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, studies on these neurodegenerative diseases suggest that inflammation is not merely a consequence of neurodegeneration but is also an essential factor in this process. Many neurological disorders involve multifaceted interactions between genetics, the environment, and immune responses, making it difficult to pinpoint their exact causes. Future research aims to overcome these hurdles through genetic advances, regenerative medicine, and personalized therapies. Cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and high-throughput screening are expected to accelerate drug discovery and improve diagnostic accuracy. Increasing collaboration between interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics, neuroscience, and immunology will lead to innovative treatment strategies. This comprehensive review discusses the therapeutic effects of enzymes, neurosteroids, and synthetic steroids in different neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, PD, ALS, and MS. Potential challenges in the therapeutic use of neurosteroids, such as the limited bioavailability and off-target effects of synthetic steroids, are also discussed, and an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the impact of these steroids on neurodegenerative disorders is presented.",

  "abstract": "There is a significant correlation between the severity of atherosclerosis in one arterial region and the occurrence of atherosclerotic disease in other regions. Identifying and managing vascular disease in patients with multifocal arterial disease is often complex. The CHA2DS2-VASc score encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors and was initially used to assess the risk of thromboembolism, stroke, and death in patients with atrial fibrillation. In recent years, this score has been proposed to predict the prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and the correlation between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and CAD in patients who were scheduled for carotid stenting due to carotid artery stenosis (CAS) but had no history of CAD. A total of 452 patients were included in the study, 213 with symptomatic CAS and 239 with asymptomatic CAS. The patients were separated into two groups: those with and without. One hundred forty-eight (32.7%) of 452 patients had critical CAD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a high CHA2DS2-VASc score (OR: 4.283, 95% CI: 2.903-6.321, P < 0.001) was an independent predictor of the development of CAD. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed 64.9% sensitivity and 82% specificity in detecting CAD of the CHA2DS2-VASc score at >4 cutoff [Area under ROC curve = 0.781 (95% CI: 0.724-0.838), P < 0.001]. When our results were analyzed, a CHA2DS2-VASc score of >4 was highly significant in predicting severe CAD.",

  "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal disease with limited treatment options due to its infiltrative nature and the lack of efficient therapy able to cross the protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). GBMs are metabolically characterized by increased glycolysis and glutamine dependence. This study explores a novel metabolism-based therapeutic approach using a polyurea generation 4 dendrimer (PURE ) surface functionalized with lactate (LA) (PURE -LA ), to take advantage of glucose-dependent monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) overexpression, loaded with selenium-chrysin (SeChry) and temozolomide (TMZ) or complexed with anti-glutaminase (GLS1) siRNAs to abrogate glutamine dependence. The nanoparticles (PURE -LA ) were efficient vehicles for cytotoxic compounds delivery, since SeChry@PURE -LA  and TMZ@PURE -LA  induced significant cell death in GBM cell lines, particularly in U251, which exhibits higher MCT1 expression. The anti-GLS1 siRNA-dendriplex with PURE -LA  (PURE -LA -anti-GLS1-siRNA) knocked down GLS1 in the GBM cell lines. In two in vitro BBB models, these dendriplexes successfully crossed the BBB, decreased GLS1 expression and altered the exometabolome of GBM cell lines, concomitantly with autophagy activation. Our findings highlight the potential of targeting glucose and glutamine pathways in GBM using dendrimer-based nanocarriers, overcoming the BBB and disrupting key metabolic processes in GBM cells. PURE -LA -anti-GLS1-siRNA dendriplexes cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and impair glioblastoma (GBM) metabolism. The BBB is formed by a thin monolayer of specialized brain microvascular endothelial cells joined together by tight junctions that selectively control the passage of substances from the blood to the brain. It is a major obstacle in the treatment of GBM, since many chemotherapeutic drugs are unable to penetrate the brain. Therefore, we developed a strategy to overcome this obstacle: a lactate-coated polyurea dendrimer generation 4 (PURE ) able to cross the BBB in vitro, that act as a nanocarrier of drugs and siRNA to the GBM cells. PURE -LA  are nanoparticles functionalized with lactate (LA) to target MCT1, a lactate transporter highly expressed by GBM cells. Moreover, a complex of this nanoparticle with anti-GLS1 (glutaminase) siRNA (PURE -LA -anti-GLS1-siRNA) was made, to target glutamine metabolism. It efficiently knocked down GLS1. Moreover, PURE -LA  loaded with SeChry led to BBB disruption.",

HTLV-1 is linked to severe diseases such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-associated myelopathy, while HTLV-2 is considered less pathogenic but can cause fibromyalgia, hairy cell leukemia, and neurological disorders. Although HTLV-2 is less prevalent than HTLV-1, it is common in specific populations, such as indigenous groups and injection drug users. In Brazil, an estimated 200,000-250,000 people are infected with HTLV-2, mostly in the North, yet data on its prevalence in pregnant women remain scarce. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HTLV-1/2 among pregnant women in Pernambuco, revealing a 0.49% prevalence rate, which exceeds that reported in other regions of Brazil. Notably, one case of HTLV-2 was identified in a non-indigenous pregnant woman, suggesting that HTLV-2 may be more widespread than previously recognized. Despite the integration of HTLV screening into routine prenatal care, a major gap exists in the awareness of HTLV-2 among healthcare professionals and the general population, hindering effective prevention and management. The study highlights the need for expanded screening, particularly in rural areas, and underscores the importance of addressing gaps in sexual health education and prevention.",

Concurrent use of atezolizumab with radiation and TMZ demonstrated OS in line with published trials for newly diagnosed GBM. Tumor genomic (WES and/or targeted NGS panel), transcriptomic (RNAseq) and tissue microenvironment imaging, as well as fecal metagenomic sequencing were conducted. Gene set enrichment analysis of tumors identified multiple immune-based transcriptomic programs to distinguish patients with longer versus shorter survival (p ≤ 0.01). GBM immune enrichment was highly associated with the pre-treatment tumor mesenchymal subtype and patient gastrointestinal bacterial taxa profile.",

  "abstract": "In clinical and research studies in which one is dealing with essential tremor (ET) patients, the identification of related conditions, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), is important. A reasonable starting point is to directly ask the patient about their disease status. We are not aware of studies on the validity of ET patients' self-reports of PD (i.e., ETPD). Our aim was to assess the validity of a self-report of PD in this setting. ET cases were enrolled in a prospective study. At each visit, they were asked, \"Have you been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease?\", a videotaped neurological examination was performed, and PD diagnoses (i.e., ETPD) were assigned by a senior movement disorders neurologist. 291 ET cases underwent 899 study evaluations. Seven cases were diagnosed with ETPD. Summing data across all cases and all study evaluations, sensitivity = 56.3% and specificity = 98.1%. The positive predictive value of a report of PD was low (36.0%), whereas the negative predictive value of a report of no PD was high (99.2%). Screening, in general, can be a difficult process, but in the setting of ET and PD, the issues are particularly challenging. Our overarching goal is to fill a gap in knowledge and inform clinical researchers and treating physicians who are working with tremor populations. Although some information is garnered from asking ET patients whether they have been diagnosed with ETPD, the low sensitivity and low positive predictive values indicate that the value of self-reported PD diagnoses is limited.",

  "abstract": "Cancer-treatment induced cardiovascular diseases are a concern in early breast cancer, especially when radiation is involved and systemic treatments may contribute. Our primary objective was to estimate the frequency of cardiac adverse events after early breast cancer treatment. We performed a systematic review on cardiac events after early breast cancer treatment, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, by searching PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science and cross-checking references from international guidelines on breast cancer treatment and cardio-oncology. Eighty-one studies were selected. Reporting of cardiac events and dose parameters was heterogeneous among studies due to the variability of the events being considered, follow-up duration and patient's age (most reported less than 5% with some as high as 34% at a maximum follow-up of 28 years). The most frequent are ischemic and valvular heart disease. Radiation modalities (hypofractionation, boost, partial or nodal irradiation) do not seem to change the risk of cardiac events. Anthracycline and aromatase inhibitors increase long-term cardiac risk, whereas anti-HER2-related effects are mostly transient. Myocardites with immunotherapy are rare (<1%) but follow-up is short. Other chemotherapy agents and poly(adenosine-diphosphate-ribose)-polymerase inhibitors have not been shown to increase cardiac risks which is reduced with more recent treatments, and increased by young age at diagnosis and previous cardiac risk factors. Advances in treatment seem to lower cardiac events. Prospective studies with exhaustive reporting of toxicity and radiotherapy features are warranted as well as the help of a cardio-oncologist to manage risk factors.",

  "abstract": "Tumor metabolism often interferes with the immune microenvironment. Although natural killer (NK) cells play pivotal roles in antitumor immunity, the connection between NK cells and tumor metabolism remains unclear. Our systematic analysis of multiomics data and survival data from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients uncovered a novel association between mitochondrial acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) and NK cell infiltration that influences disease progression. ACAT1, a metabolic enzyme involved in reversible conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA to two molecules of acetyl-CoA, exhibits nuclear protein acetylation activity through its translocation. Under immune stimulation, mitochondrial ACAT1 can be phosphorylated at serine 60 (S60) and enters the nucleus; however, this process is hindered in nutrient-poor tumor microenvironments. Nuclear ACAT1 directly acetylates lysine 146 of p50 (NFKB1), attenuating its DNA binding and transcriptional repression activity and thereby increasing the expression of immune-related factors, which in turn promotes NK cell recruitment and activation to suppress colorectal cancer growth. Furthermore, significant associations are found among low nuclear ACAT1 levels, decreased S60 phosphorylation, and reduced NK cell infiltration, as well as poor prognosis in CRC. Our findings reveal an unexpected function of ACAT1 as a nuclear acetyltransferase and elucidate its role in NK cell-dependent antitumor immunity through p50 acetylation.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze results of AHSCT and to identify prognostic factors. Overall, 700 patients transplanted in first complete remission between the years 1999-2020 were included. Median patient age was 31.9 years (68% male). B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) and T-cell precursor ALL (TCP-ALL) was diagnosed in 35% and 65%, respectively. Among 190 patients with available data, negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status was reported in 167 (88%) cases. The probabilities of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years were 67% and 56%; relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 39% and 5%, respectively. TCP-ALL was associated with lower RI (41% vs. 56%, p=0.001), higher LFS (52% vs. 38%, p=0.002) and OS (58% vs 45%, p=0.001) at 5 years when compared to BCP-ALL. In the multivariate analysis, TCP-ALL and longer interval from diagnosis do AHSCT were associated with reduced risk of relapse (HR 0.7, p=0.006 and HR=0.95, p=0.018), better LFS (HR=0.76, p=0.02 and HR=0.95, p=0.01) and OS (HR=0.75, p=0.024 and HR=0.94, p=0.013, respectively). Increasing patient age was associated with higher NRM (HR=1.49, p<0.0001), worse LFS (HR=1.1, p=0.01) and OS (HR=1.17, p=0.0001). Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is relatively safe option of late treatment intensification in adults with Ph- ALL. It may be a valuable option especially in patients with TCP-ALL, however it should be proved in prospective clinical trials.",

  "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of B cell and plasma cell malignancies, and numerous promising targets against solid tumours are being explored. Despite their initial therapeutic success in hematological cancers, relapse occurs in a significant fraction of patients, highlighting the need for further innovations in advancing CAR T cell therapy. Tumour antigen heterogeneity and acquired tumour resistance leading to antigen escape (antigen loss/downregulation) have emerged as a crucial factor contributing to immune escape and CAR T cell resistance, particularly in the case of solid tumours with only limited success achieved to date. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of tumour relapse in CAR T cell therapy and the promising strategies that are under development to overcome multiple resistance mechanisms, thereby reducing outgrowth of antigen escape variants. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of designing clinical translational strategies to enhance CAR T cell crosstalk with host immune cells, eliciting endogenous antitumour immune responses through antigen/epitope spreading, which offers a genuine solution to the limitations of targeting tumour antigen heterogeneity in solid tumours with monospecific T cell therapies.",

However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota is involved in the genesis of chronic itch, a refractory condition that afflicts patients both physically and mentally. Here, we report that depletion of gut microbiota enhances tolerance to itch in mice orally administered with antibiotics (ABX) and mice free of germ. Of note, oral gavage with   ( ), a prominent species of the genus   with most differential change, corrected the ABX-induced itch dysfunction through its driven metabolite acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC). Mechanistically, gut microbiota or   depletion caused a decrease in RNA N6-methyladenosine (m A) demethylase FTO expression in the dorsal horn and a consequent increase in RNA m A sites in Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor F ( ) mRNA, leading to decreased MRGPRF protein.

Although estrogen deprivation is a known risk factor for AD in females, the impact of androgen deprivation on AD pathology in males, particularly regarding neuroinflammation, remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of long-term systemic androgen deprivation on AD pathology, including glial cell-specific gene expression, amyloid β (Aβ) pathology, and cognitive function in male castrated App  (App) mice. We found significantly reduced androgen receptor (AR/Ar) expression levels in the precunei of male patients with early AD pathology and isolated brain microglia of male App mice compared with their nonpathological controls. In castrated App mice, microglial Tnf and Il6 and astrocytic Socs3 were downregulated, indicating that androgens may promote inflammation in the brain. However, Aβ accumulation and cognitive function were unaffected. These results suggest that although systemic androgen deprivation modulates neuroinflammation, the changes are insufficient to alter the AD phenotype or pathology in male App mice.",

  "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are autosomal dominant genetic disorders characterized by progressive cerebellar degeneration and phenotypic variability. MJD/SCA3, the most prevalent form around the world and in Latin America, is also likely the most common hereditary ataxia in Uruguay. Despite its relevance, Uruguay lacks comprehensive epidemiological studies, and molecular diagnostics remain inaccessible in public health systems. This review provides a phenotypic description on genetically confirmed patients with MJD/SCA3 as a first step towards generating knowledge on this matter in our country. A retrospective review of 37 Uruguayan patients with suspected SCA was conducted. Sixteen patients with confirmed molecular diagnosis of MJD/SCA3 were included on this review. Data collected encompassed demographic information, genetic testing results, clinical manifestations, and imaging findings. Patients were evaluated at the Ataxias Polyclinic, Hospital de Clínicas, between 2019 and 2024 by the authors. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 29.0. The mean age of symptom onset was 41.75 years, with gait ataxia as the initial symptom in 87.5% of cases. Clinical findings included appendicular ataxia (100%), dysarthria (90%), and oculomotor alterations (90%), with diverse deep sensitivity impairment in 62.5%. Genetic testing revealed an average of 72.9 CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene. Cerebellar atrophy was observed in 75% of patients with MRI. Most had a diagnostic delay of 6.5 years and an autosomal dominant family history. Findings align with international descriptions of MJD/SCA3 while highlighting regional characteristics, including a potential genetic link with southern Brazil. The absence of dysautonomia, typically prevalent in MJD/SCA3, suggests underdiagnosis or insufficient evaluation. This study underscores the need for systematic clinical and molecular evaluations in Uruguay and serves as a foundation to understand hereditary ataxias at a national level. Further research is essential for improving diagnosis and management of this complex pathology.",

The measurements were made with an automated pupillometry under static conditions. The static measurements were performed at scotopic, mesopic, and photopic light intensities. The differences between the patient and control groups were analyzed with static measurements. Pupillary diameters of the patient and control groups under scotopic, mesopic, and photopic conditions were observed and there was a statistically significant difference under the mesopic and photopic conditions. Under mesopic conditions: The mean pupil diameter was found to be 5.92 ± 0.69 mm in the VB12D group and 5.18 ± 0.91 mm in the control group (P = 0.003). Under photopic conditions, the mean pupil diameter was found to be 5.13 ± 0.77 mm in the VB12D group and 4.53 ± 0.96 mm in the control group (P = 0.001).

There was no statistically significant difference between the patient and control groups in the measurements under scotopic conditions (P = 0.63). Pediatric patients with VB12D have significantly larger pupil diameters in photopic and mesopic conditions than healthy children. The results suggest that there is an autonomic system dysfunction in children with VB12D, especially when the parasympathetic system is negatively affected. Pupillary contraction is reduced in children with VB12D. Decreased pupillary myosis function is observed.

However, nearly half of the patients (59/127, 46.5%) referred for lymph node resection did not undergo adequate lymphadenectomy. The prognosis of CSS cannot be improved by lymphadenectomy for most patients (T0-T1) who are referred for endoscopic therapy because of the low rate of lymph node metastasis.

  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders present a significant challenge to healthcare systems, mainly due to the limited availability of effective treatment options to halt or reverse disease progression. Endogenous steroids synthesized in the central nervous system, such as pregnenolone (PREG), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), progesterone (PROG), and allopregnanolone (ALLO), have been identified as potential therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases. Neurosteroids such as ALLO, DHEA, and PROG, as well as their synthetic analogs like Ganaxolene, Fluasterone, and Olexoxime, offer promising effects for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Moreover, Brexanolone and Ganaxolone are synthetic steroids approved for the treatment of postpartum depression and epilepsy, respectively. Neurosteroids such as ALLO are crucial in modulating GABAergic neurotransmission and reducing neuroinflammation. These compounds enhance the activity of GABA-A receptors, leading to increased inhibitory signaling in the brain, which can help regulate mood, cognition, and neuroprotection. Small clinical trials and observational studies indicate that ALLO may have cognitive benefits, but no large-scale, definitive meta-analysis confirms a 20% improvement in AD patients. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological diseases due to the high-energy demand and sensitivity of neurons to oxidative stress. Reduced mitochondrial function leads to amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles accumulation in AD. In Parkinson's disease (PD), mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the PINK1 or Parkin genes leads to energy deficiencies and the accumulation of toxic byproducts. Mutations in genes such as SOD1, C9orf72, and TDP-43 have been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, studies on these neurodegenerative diseases suggest that inflammation is not merely a consequence of neurodegeneration but is also an essential factor in this process. Many neurological disorders involve multifaceted interactions between genetics, the environment, and immune responses, making it difficult to pinpoint their exact causes. Future research aims to overcome these hurdles through genetic advances, regenerative medicine, and personalized therapies. Cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and high-throughput screening are expected to accelerate drug discovery and improve diagnostic accuracy. Increasing collaboration between interdisciplinary fields such as bioinformatics, neuroscience, and immunology will lead to innovative treatment strategies. This comprehensive review discusses the therapeutic effects of enzymes, neurosteroids, and synthetic steroids in different neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD, PD, ALS, and MS. Potential challenges in the therapeutic use of neurosteroids, such as the limited bioavailability and off-target effects of synthetic steroids, are also discussed, and an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the impact of these steroids on neurodegenerative disorders is presented.",

  "abstract": "Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) is a retrovirus with two subtypes, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. HTLV-1 is linked to severe diseases such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-associated myelopathy, while HTLV-2 is considered less pathogenic but can cause fibromyalgia, hairy cell leukemia, and neurological disorders. Although HTLV-2 is less prevalent than HTLV-1, it is common in specific populations, such as indigenous groups and injection drug users. In Brazil, an estimated 200,000-250,000 people are infected with HTLV-2, mostly in the North, yet data on its prevalence in pregnant women remain scarce. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HTLV-1/2 among pregnant women in Pernambuco, revealing a 0.49% prevalence rate, which exceeds that reported in other regions of Brazil. Notably, one case of HTLV-2 was identified in a non-indigenous pregnant woman, suggesting that HTLV-2 may be more widespread than previously recognized. Despite the integration of HTLV screening into routine prenatal care, a major gap exists in the awareness of HTLV-2 among healthcare professionals and the general population, hindering effective prevention and management. The study highlights the need for expanded screening, particularly in rural areas, and underscores the importance of addressing gaps in sexual health education and prevention.",

  "abstract": "Choice of first-in-human dose has critical implications for the safety of Phase I participants as well as the likelihood of reaching the therapeutic dose range during escalation. In this analysis, we present a population concentration-response modelling approach for selecting the Phase I starting dose for a novel stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1 (STING) agonist, SNX281. Given the immune agonist mechanism of SNX281, we opted to select the starting dose according to the minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL). To determine the MABEL concentration, we fitted a population concentration-response model to cytokine induction data from an ex vivo whole blood assay. We selected a whole blood assay to obviate the need for free fraction scaling for this highly protein-bound drug. We used the population concentration-response model to estimate the lower 10th percentile for the 10% maximal interferon-β response concentration of SNX281, which was chosen as the MABEL concentration. We translated the ex vivo MABEL concentration to a human MABEL dose using a human pharmacokinetic projection based on allometric scaling from preclinical species. The human dose-peak concentration relationship projection fell within 2-fold of the clinical result. After the application of a safety factor, the MABEL dose was applied in the clinic and did not demonstrate dose-limiting toxicities. Our novel population modelling-based MABEL strategy for first-in-human dose selection resulted in successful clinical translation of a small molecule STING agonist.",

  "abstract": "In clinical and research studies in which one is dealing with essential tremor (ET) patients, the identification of related conditions, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), is important. A reasonable starting point is to directly ask the patient about their disease status. We are not aware of studies on the validity of ET patients' self-reports of PD (i.e., ETPD). Our aim was to assess the validity of a self-report of PD in this setting. ET cases were enrolled in a prospective study. At each visit, they were asked, \"Have you been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease?\", a videotaped neurological examination was performed, and PD diagnoses (i.e., ETPD) were assigned by a senior movement disorders neurologist. 291 ET cases underwent 899 study evaluations. Seven cases were diagnosed with ETPD. Summing data across all cases and all study evaluations, sensitivity = 56.3% and specificity = 98.1%. The positive predictive value of a report of PD was low (36.0%), whereas the negative predictive value of a report of no PD was high (99.2%). Screening, in general, can be a difficult process, but in the setting of ET and PD, the issues are particularly challenging. Our overarching goal is to fill a gap in knowledge and inform clinical researchers and treating physicians who are working with tremor populations. Although some information is garnered from asking ET patients whether they have been diagnosed with ETPD, the low sensitivity and low positive predictive values indicate that the value of self-reported PD diagnoses is limited.",

  "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of today's leading public health issues worldwide. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) dapagliflozin recently received a label expansion. It is now approved for treatment of HF across the entire spectrum of ejection fraction (EF) in Germany. However, real-world data are limited. EVOLUTION-HF DE  aims to complement existing data in Germany under the multinational umbrella EVOLUTION-HF study protocol. EVOLUTION-HF DE  (NCT06336330) is a non-interventional, prospective, longitudinal cohort study. It is planned to enrol a total of 1000 (700 evaluable) patients with HF in Germany. Distribution is planned as 40% patients with preserved (HFpEF), 20% with mildly reduced (HFmrEF), and 40% with reduced EF (HFrEF). Patients ≥18 years of age, who started dapagliflozin treatment 14-90 days prior to enrolment according to the local product label, are eligible to participate. Among reasons for exclusion are previous SGLT2i treatment (including dapagliflozin), type 1 diabetes, and hypersensitivity to dapagliflozin or its excipients. Data on medical history, HF status and medication before dapagliflozin treatment will be collected retrospectively at baseline. Follow-up data will concern clinical symptoms, healthcare utilization, HF and concomitant medication, as well as dapagliflozin usage. These data will be extracted from real-world data sources like patient charts, discharge letters, and electronic medical records. They will be collected prospectively every 3 months for up to 12 months. In addition, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), medication adherence, work productivity, and patient's needs, expectations, and satisfaction with medical care will be collected using standardized and unstandardized questionnaires. Primary objectives include demographic and clinical characterization of patients and the assessment of treatment patterns of dapagliflozin, other HF medications, and glucose-lowering medications. Secondary objectives are to describe HRQoL, medication adherence, and work productivity. Exploratory objectives are to describe depression, healthcare utilization, and patient's needs, expectations, and satisfaction with medical care. EVOLUTION-HF DE  has included its first patient in April 2024 and is currently open for enrolment. EVOLUTION-HF DE  will deliver relevant insights into real-world dapagliflozin treatment for HF focusing on clinical and patient perspective in Germany.",

  "abstract": "Patients with severe mental disorder and diabetes may be exposed to inappropriate polypharmacy increasing the risk of side effects and drug interactions. Although medication reviews may facilitate short-term deprescribing, they are not known to affect clinical outcomes. We investigated whether implementing physician-led medication reviews through interdisciplinary dialogue can change prescription patterns and improve pharmacological efficacy and tolerability in psychiatric outpatients with diabetes. Included in the study were 52 patients from an endocrinologist-psychiatrist outpatient clinic in Slagelse Region, Zealand, Denmark. Patients were allocated to an intervention group, where patients' pharmacological treatment was discussed at an interdisciplinary treatment conference based on a medication review conducted by a specialist in clinical pharmacology or a control group receiving standard care. All patients underwent psychometric testing, side effect screening, clinical interviews, and had drug regimens and biochemical test results extracted from the electronic health records at baseline and at 6 months follow up. The trial was completed by 48 patients. Average time to follow up was 7 months (range 5-11 months). The intervention group had a median reduction of 1 drug (interquartile range [IQR] -4.00, 0.00) and 1 potentially inappropriate prescription (IQR -2.00, 0.00) compared to a median increase of 2 drugs (IQR 1.00, 3.00) and 2 potentially inappropriate prescriptions (IQR 0.00, 3.00) in the control group. The usage of both somatic and psychiatric drugs was reduced. We found no differences in clinical outcomes. Deprescribing can be achieved without worsening psychiatric symptoms in psychiatric outpatients by implementing physician-led medication reviews through interdisciplinary dialogue.

  "abstract": "Efflux pumps in Pseudomonas aeruginosa play an important role in decreasing the bacterium's antibiotic susceptibility. This study aimed to identify P. aeruginosa efflux pumps and examine the effect of Zinc sulfate on these pumps. This study was conducted on 104 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from different types of specimens. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of all isolates was examined by disc diffusion and microdilution methods. A Cartwheel test was done for phenotypic detection of P. aeruginosa efflux pumps in the presence and absence of zinc sulfate. The expression of efflux pumps encoding genes and their regulators in the presence and absence of zinc sulfate was measured using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. A high rate of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pattern was observed among the tested isolates (55.7%). Combining different antibiotics with Zinc sulfate exhibited synergistic effects against most of the studied isolates. The addition of sub-inhibitory concentrations of Zinc sulfate to the cartwheel test was found to inhibit efflux pump activity in all tested isolates. The expression of the positive regulator gene, mexT, was significantly decreased. Additionally, Zinc sulfate significantly upregulated the expression of the mexR gene (P-value < 0.05), a negative regulator of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump. Zinc sulfate demonstrated a strong antimicrobial effect against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. We recommend the use of Zinc sulfate as an antibiotic adjuvant and efflux pump inhibitor in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections to enhance the bacterium's susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.",

This study aimed to evaluate the safety outcomes of propafenone use in atrial fibrillation patients with heart failure when compared to those of amiodarone use. This population-based cohort study used the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Eligible patients were those who had atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter diagnosis, had heart failure diagnosis, and first received propafenone or amiodarone between 2002 and 2018. The primary endpoints were death due to arrhythmia and the composite proarrhythmic outcome, which consisted of sudden cardiac arrest, arrhythmic death, ventricular arrhythmia and implantation of defibrillator. After propensity score matching, the study cohort consisted of 7235 propafenone and 14 470 amiodarone users. Compared to amiodarone, propafenone was associated with significantly lower risk of the composite proarrhythmic outcome (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.64; P < .001). Propafenone users also had lower risk of death owing to arrhythmia compared to amiodarone users (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.65; P = .006). Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis showed similar trends, favouring propafenone. Propafenone was not significantly associated with increased risk of proarrhythmia and mortality when compared to amiodarone in atrial fibrillation patients with heart failure in contemporary real-world settings. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether propafenone should definitely be avoided in these patients.",

  "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a well-known complication of diabetes. The main therapeutic options for treating DFU include surgical debridement. However, conditions such as sensory loss and insufficient blood supply can lead to lower extremity amputations. Inflammatory biomarkers, including the neutrophil‒lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet‒lymphocyte ratio (PLR), have shown promise in predicting the development of diabetes complications. This study included 126 individuals with known DFUs who underwent amputation or debridement surgery during hospitalization between January 2017 and December 2022. The participants were divided into two groups, each containing 63 patients, based on the treatment they received. Analyses were conducted via univariate and multivariate regression models. The linearity of the relationship between each inflammatory index and the risk of amputation was further examined via restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves with four knots. Categorical regression analysis showed an elevated risk of amputation in patients with an NLR greater than 6.08, with an OR of 13.090 (95% CI: 5.143-33.320, P < 0.001), compared with those with an NLR less than 6.08. Additionally, patients with a PLR greater than 210 demonstrated a similarly elevated risk of amputation with an OR of 2.31 (95% CI: 1.066‒4.669, P = 0.033); however, those with lymphocyte‒white blood cell ratio (LWR) levels of greater than 0.1265 exhibited reduced likelihood of having amputation (OR: 0.092 (95% CI: 0.038‒0.226, P < 0.001)). This study supports that NLR, PLR and LWR may have value as a predictive marker for amputation in patients with DFUs.",

  "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance continues to pose a significant global challenge associated with increased rates of illness and death. The emergence of multidrug resistance patterns in pathogenic bacteria poses a challenge in their treatment, rendering them unmanageable with traditional antibiotics in the foreseeable future. Thus, prioritising innovative pharmaceuticals for therapy and exploring alternate approaches to combat antimicrobial resistance is of utmost importance. Endophytic bacteria derived from medicinal plants are reservoirs of active therapeutic compounds, offering a promising alternative for discovering novel and therapeutically bioactive compounds. This work involved the isolation and identification of four endophytic bacteria from Combretum erythrophyllum. The antibacterial activity and metabolic profiling of the secondary metabolite extract were assessed via the microdilution technique and gas chromatography data analysis, respectively. The assessed extract showed wide-ranging effectiveness against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with a particular preference for Klebsiella aerogenes (ATCC 27853) at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 125 µg/mL. The analysed secondary metabolites revealed phytochemicals, namely terpenoids, ketones, phytosterols, phenols, alkanes, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) as the bioactive constituents. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of the endophytic bacteria of C. erythrophyllum as a potential source of active natural bioactive compounds for antibiotic therapy.",

CeD onset results from a multifaceted interplay of genetic and environmental factors. While recent data show that alterations in gut microbiome composition could play an important role, many current studies are constrained by small sample sizes and limited resolution. To address these limitations, we analyzed fecal gut microbiota from two Dutch cohorts, CeDNN (128 treated CeD patients (tCeD), 106 controls) and the Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project (24 self-reported tCeD, 654 controls), using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Self-reported IBS (570 cases, 1710 controls) and IBD (93 cases, 465 controls) were used as comparative conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Interindividual variation within the case and control groups was calculated at whole microbiome and strain level. Finally, species-specific gene repertoires were analyzed in tCeD patients and controls. Within-individual microbiome diversity was decreased in patients with self-reported IBS and IBD but not in tCeD patients. Each condition displayed a unique microbial pattern and, in addition to confirming previously reported microbiome associations, we identify an increase in the levels of  ,  , and  , amongst others. We further show that the observed changes can partially be explained by gluten-free diet adherence. We also observe increased interindividual variation of gut microbiome composition among tCeD patients and a higher bacterial mutation frequency in tCeD that contributes to higher interindividual variation at strain level. In addition, the immotile European subspecies of  , which has a distinct carbohydrate metabolism potential, was nearly absent in tCeD patients. Our study sheds light on the complex interplay between the gut microbiome and CeD, revealing increased interindividual variation and strain-level variation in tCeD patients.

  "abstract": "This study systematically compares the risk of long-term ocular adverse events between subcutaneous and oral semaglutide preparations to assess pathway-specific safety differences. In this study, the Report odds ratio (ROR) technique was employed to detect signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of semaglutide. Analysis was conducted on data extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database, covering the period from 2004(Q1) through 2024(Q3). This investigation encompasses a descriptive analysis focused on the administration of semaglutide through various routes, encompassing a broad range of demographics including gender (male and female), age groups, along with other demographic data and the timing of disease onset. Following this, the study employs the ROR methodology to assess the differential adverse event signals across distinct semaglutide formulations. We categorized the eye as the System Organ Class (SOC) and obtained 1733 ADE reports related to it from the FAERS database. Of these, 1541 reports were associated with injectables, while tablets were linked to 192 ADE reports. In both dosage forms, most cases occurred within the first month of administration, although the median time to onset (TTO) differed, with injectables identified at 7.00 [IQR 0.00-56.00] days and tablets at only 3.50 [IQR 0.00-35.00] days. It is worth noting that 5.41% of patients administered subcutaneous injections and 2.17% of those receiving oral medications reported ADEs following one year of treatment with semaglutide. Furthermore, female patients exhibited a higher susceptibility to ocular adverse reactions compared to their male counterparts. Regarding the primary preferred terms (PTs), blurred vision constitutes 34.33% of the total ADEs associated with tablet formulations. This incidence is marginally higher than that observed with injectable formulations. This investigation further discerned ocular ADEs signals associated with specific formulations: subcutaneous injections have a higher frequency of reports concerning retinal complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, retinal tear, and retinal hemorrhage. The results of this study identified a significant difference between subcutaneous and oral semaglutide in ocular ADE risk, providing some evidence for dosage form selection and risk monitoring for clinical use.",

  "abstract": "This study investigates the physicochemical properties, heavy metal concentrations, and bacterial profiles of contaminated scrapyard soils compared to fertile agricultural soil. The results indicate that scrapyard soils exhibit higher bulk density (1.10 1.30 g/cm³), lower organic carbon (0.80 1.10%), and reduced organic matter (1.37 1.90%) levels, suggesting deterioration in soil fertility. Electrical conductivity is significantly elevated (0.70 0.80 dS/m), indicating increased ionic strength. Heavy metal analysis reveals significantly higher concentrations of Pb (14 18 mg/kg), Cd (3 7 mg/kg), Zn (20 40 mg/kg), Cu (23 35 mg/kg), Ni (23 30 mg/kg), and As (3.85 5.5 mg/kg). Bacterial loads in scrapyard soils (3.08 3.76 Log CFU/g) are considerably lower than in control soil (7.88 Log CFU/g), alongside decreased soil enzyme activities, including dehydrogenase (130 170 µg TPF/g/h), urease (110 130 µg NH₄⁺/g/h), phosphatase (70-90 µg pNP/g/h), and catalase (85-95 µg O₂/g/h). The study isolates Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Klebsiella aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas reactans, and Bacillus subtilis, which exhibit varying resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals. A strong correlation is observed between heavy metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance (r = 0.78 0.88, P < 0.05), suggesting a synergistic effect where metal exposure enhances bacterial resilience to antibiotics. Notably, the MICs of tetracycline and ampicillin increase substantially in Cd-exposed isolates (up to 35 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL, respectively), while Ni exposure in Pseudomonas reactans results in a two-fold increase in the MIC of chloramphenicol (from 10.5 µg/mL to 20 µg/mL). The correlation between soil enzyme activity and dominant bacterial species further highlights the influence of heavy metal contamination on microbial function. These findings underscore the environmental risks posed by scrapyard contamination and the adaptive mechanisms of multi-resistant bacteria in response to heavy metal stress.",

Additionally, we assess the prevalence of congenital heart malformations (CHM) in NF-NS compared to 'classic' neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). A 9-year, prospective, monocentric study was conducted, involving patients with NF1 pathogenic variants (PVs) and Noonan syndrome-like facial phenotype (NSLFP). Twenty-six patients were enrolled. NSLFP was categorized as 'suggestive' in 69% of cases and 'typical' in 31%. The presence of at least two facial abnormalities (e.g., low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, and ptosis) was consistently observed in 'typical' cases.

NF-NS is a distinct phenotypic variant of NF1, marked by NSLP with consistent facial features -, and frequent pectus excavatum. F2G demonstrated high diagnostic concordance, reinforcing its clinical utility. Given the elevated risk of CHM, especially pulmonic stenosis, proactive cardiovascular assessment similar to other RASopathies is recommended for NS-NF patients, regardless of NF1 PV type.",

However, the direct haemodynamic effects of GLP-1 RAs remain inadequately characterized. We aim to investigate temporal trends of pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in HF patients receiving GLP-1 RAs. In this single-centre retrospective cohort study, we identified HF patients with a CardioMEMS device who received semaglutide or tirzepatide for at least 6 months during the monitoring period.

  "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major global health threat due to its remarkable ability of resistance, persistence in hostile environments and tolerance to stress conditions. Phenylacetic acid (PAA) catabolism, traditionally known for bacterial metabolic advantage, is now being investigated for its role in the pathogenesis of A. baumannii. This study aims to explore how PAA and its metabolic processes influence the virulence factors and antibiotic resistance of A. baumannii MCC 2076. We examined growth kinetics and PAA utilization to assess the time-dependent breakdown of PAA. In vitro analyses were conducted to evaluate biofilm formation, bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and tolerance to desiccation stress in PAA-catabolizing cells. Our findings revealed a two-fold increase in biofilm formation and an 8% enhancement in bacterial surface adherence. Additionally, we observed an increase in efflux pump activity and a decrease in outer membrane permeability when PAA served as a carbon source. All these factors may be responsible for 2- to 3-fold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ampicillin, and piperacillin. A. baumannii cells with an active paa operon demonstrated a higher survival rate under desiccation stress compared to control cells. RT-qPCR analysis indicated the upregulation of genes such as gacA, csuE, ompA, and adeR, which are associated with virulence related genes like biofilm forming, adherence and antibiotic resistance related genes. The catabolism of PAA is crucial, as its utilization significantly alters the virulence characteristics of A. baumannii MCC 2076. This study provides valuable insights into the PAA catabolic pathway's role in modulating virulence gene expression, potentially offering new therapeutic targets for combating A. baumannii infections.",

  "abstract": "In 2022, the American Heart Association launched an updated algorithm for quantifying cardiovascular health (CVH), termed Life's Essential 8 (LE8). This new approach has been shown to be associated with various noncommunicable chronic diseases and mortality. However, LE8 did not take into consideration the importance of psychological health on CVH. Recently, a perspective article proposed Life's Crucial 9 (LC9), which would add psychological health as another component to LE8, as a novel metric to assess CVH. This study aims to investigate the association of LC9 with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. This study included 23,080 adults from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2018, and mortality was ascertained by linkage to National Death Index records through 31 December 2019. The LC9 scoring algorithm was categorized into low (0-49), moderate (50-79), and high (80-100) CVH. Weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models and restricted cubic spline analysis were applied to evaluate the association of LC9 with mortality. During a median follow-up of 7.8 years, a total of 2,388 overall deaths were identified, covering 613 CVD deaths. Compared with adults with a low CVH score, those with a high CVH score had 52% (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.60) and 64% (0.36; 0.23-0.56) reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Similarly, a moderate CVH score was associated with 33% (0.67; 0.58-0.78) and 49% (0.51; 0.40-0.64) reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. The population-attributable fractions of high vs. moderate or low CVH score were 46.0% for all-cause mortality and 75.8% for CVD mortality. Elevated blood lipids, high body mass index, and poor sleep quality were the three major contributors to all-cause mortality, whereas nicotine exposure, unhealthy psychology, and elevated blood lipids were the three significant ones to CVD mortality. There were approximately negative linear dose-response relationships of total LC9 score with all-cause and CVD mortality. Adhering to a high LC9 score is related to a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. This new CVH definition shows promise as a primordial preventive strategy to reduce mortality rates.",

To evaluate the liver and renal outcomes among new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) versus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and other anti-diabetic medications in patients with MASLD and T2DM. Retrospective cohort study. Electronic health records. A total number of 88 306 patients with MASLD and T2DM were included in a propensity score-matched analysis comparing the effects of anti-diabetic drugs. Patients were categorized into groups based on their initiation of anti-diabetic medications. The primary outcomes were the incidence of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensations, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary outcomes were a progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), severity of CKD stages, and the need for hemodialysis. In the SGLT2i versus DPP4i, a reduced risk of cirrhosis was observed in the SGLT2i (HR: 0.97), along with fewer hepatic decompensations (HR: 0.84) and a lower incidence of HCC (HR: 0.50). CKD progression, particularly to stages 4-5, was significantly lower in the SGLT2i (HR: 0.53), as was hemodialysis (HR: 0.38). However, SGLT2i exhibited a slightly lower risk of CKD progression (HR: 0.77) and a reduced need for hemodialysis (HR: 0.71) compared to the GLP-1RA, while there was no difference in hepatic outcomes between the GLP-1RA and SGLT2i. SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with MASLD and T2DM demonstrated reduced risks of liver complications and a favorable impact on renal outcomes. These findings support the preferential consideration of SGLT2i in managing this patient population, particularly for mitigating the progression of liver and kidney diseases.",

  "abstract": "Afforestation has emerged as a nature-based strategy for climate mitigation and urban sustainability, yet its effects on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils remain underexplored. This study investigates how the conversion of croplands into plantation forests affects the soil resistome, bacterial communities, and physicochemical properties in an urban environment. Using high-throughput metagenomic and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we analyzed soil samples from croplands and afforested plots with Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) and Chinese scholar (Sophora japonica) trees, across two-time points post-afforestation. Our results show that afforestation promotes the convergence of both bacterial and ARG communities over time, accompanied by a significant reduction in the relative abundance of human pathogenic bacteria. Afforested soils exhibited a lower prevalence of high-risk ARGs (e.g., qnrA, qnrB from the quinolone class) and reduced co-occurrence between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), particularly transposases and recombinases, suggesting diminished horizontal gene transfer. Additionally, afforestation-induced changes in soil pH and nutrient dynamics emerged as key ecological factors shaping ARG profiles. Differences between afforestation types were also observed, with Pinus plantations presenting lower ARG-derived risks than Sophora forests. This study supports afforestation as a nature-based solution for enhancing urban sustainability, reducing public health risks, and achieving resilient ecosystems under anthropogenic influence.",

  "abstract": "Detection of atherosclerosis is essential to the management and prevention of life-threatening cardiovascular events. Although non-invasive imaging modalities, such as  F-sodium fluoride ( F-NaF),  F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( F-FDG) PET, and CT, visualize distinct hallmarks of atherosclerosis, there has yet to be a singular multi-cohort interrogation of their strengths and limitations. Thus, we focused on identifying the optimal approach for visualizing atherosclerosis at different stages of disease progression. In this study, 6-week-old, male, ApoE deficient mice (Apoe ) were placed on a high cholesterol diet for 12-20 weeks to induce calcific atherosclerotic disease. Age-matched, male, wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice fed with regular chow served as the control group. Mice were imaged at 12, 15, 18, and 20 weeks after starting their respective diets. To follow the progression of calcified atherosclerotic lesions, at each time point, in vivo,  F-NaF microPET/CT images were acquired 1 h and 3 h post tracer i.v. injection. In a separate cohort, in vivo  F-FDG PET/CT images were acquired at 3 and 5 h post tracer i.v. injection to follow inflammation as a result of progressive atherosclerotic lesion formation. High-resolution microCT images were acquired for all mice to visualize aorta calcification. After each imaging session, a subset (n = 3) was euthanized from each group and histological analysis of the aorta was performed to confirm disease progression. In this comparative study, within the same cohort,  F-NaF PET detected atherosclerotic calcification earlier than microCT. At both 1 and 3 h post-injection (p.i.), calcified lesions were clearly detected by  F-NaF with a six-fold higher signal in Apoe  compared to WT mice. Interestingly,  F-NaF signal peaked at week 18, whereas aortic CT signal progressively increased with a 13-, 16-, and 29-fold at 15, 18, and 20 weeks, respectively.  F-FDG arortic accumulation at weeks 12 and 15, were significantly greater in Apoe   mice than WT control when images were acquired at 5 h but not at 3 h p.i.. In contrast to histological analysis, at ≥ 16 weeks where inflammation is significantly elevated,  F-FDG was equivalent in Apoe  and WT control mice and significantly reduced with disease progression. Our results show that  F-NaF PET and  F-FDG PET are sensitive imaging modalities for the early detection of atherosclerotic lesions. However, both  F-NaF PET and high-resolution microCT prove to be effective methods for monitoring late-stage and progressive disease.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy of bariatric surgery in BD/SCZ patients, aiming to inform clinical decisions and optimize treatment strategies for this population. MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched up to September 2024. A restricted maximum likelihood random-effects model with mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI), was used. 13 studies involving 19,662 patients, of whom 1,117 (5.7%) were diagnosed with BD or SCZ, were included. The analysis revealed no significant differences in %TWL or BMI change at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. BD/SCZ patients showed a significantly smaller %EWL at 6 months; however, the differences at 1 and 2 years were no longer statistically significant. Similarly, no differences were found between BD/SCZ patients and controls regarding adherence to 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up, as well as 1-year remission rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, dyslipidemia, or 30-day readmission and reoperation rates. Data from included studies also indicated no exacerbation of psychiatric disorders after surgery. This study suggests that bariatric surgery may be similarly effective in patients with BD and SCZ, offering potential benefits for a population burdened with both psychiatric and physical health challenges.",

  "abstract": "Hospital wastewater (HWW) is a substantial environmental reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and poses risks to public health and aquatic ecosystems. However, research on the diversity, transmission mechanisms, pathogenic hosts, and risks of ARGs in different HWW types is limited. This study involved the collection of HWW samples from 15 hospitals in Hefei, China, which were subsequently categorized as general hospitals (GHs) and non-general hospitals (NGHs). A 280.28-Gbp sequencing dataset was generated using a metagenomic sequencing strategy and analyzed using metagenomic assembly and binning approaches to highlight these issues in GHs and NGHs. Results showed significant differences between GHs and NGHs in ARG distribution, microbial community composition, and hosts of ARGs. Potential pathogens such as Rhodocyclaceae bacterium ICHIAU1 and Acidovorax caeni were more abundant in GHs. Furthermore, plasmid-mediated ARGs (45.21%) were more prevalent than chromosome-mediated ARGs (25.74%) in HWW, with a significantly higher proportion of plasmid-mediated ARGs in GHs compared to NGHs. The co-occurrence of ARGs and mobile genetic elements was more frequent in GHs. Additionally, the antibiotic resistome risk index was higher in GHs (38.73 ± 12.84) than NGHs (22.53 ± 11.80), indicating a greater risk of ARG transmission in GHs. This pioneering study provides valuable insights into the transmission mechanisms and hosts of ARGs in hospital settings, emphasizing the increased risk of ARG transmission in GHs.",

  "abstract": "Bloodstream infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis are among the most frequent and serious infections in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), being responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality. However, how S. epidermidis prevails, disseminates and evolves to cause outbreaks in NICU is poorly understood. We aimed to understand what is the genomic basis of S. epidermidis outbreaks in NICU to provide guidelines for a better infection control. We collected all S. epidermidis isolated from newborn blood cultures admitted to a hospital NICU in Brazil over one-year and compared their genomes. The S. epidermidis infection incidence rate was 1.17 per baby-year. 83.64% of S. epidermidis were resistant to methicillin (MRSE) and 84.5% belonged to sequence type 2 (ST2) or related, carrying the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type III or IVa. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis showed that S. epidermidis infections resulted from the co-existence of three ST2 transmission chains originating from distinct endemic sources (<50 SNPs). Each transmission chain was characterized by specific antibiotic resistance and virulence profile and content in staphylococcal cassette chromosome elements (SCCmec, SCC non-mec and ACME). During transmission, other mobile genetic elements were acquired/lost and mutations emerged in genes involved in adhesion, signal transduction, general metabolism, replication, recombination and repair. Tracking S. epidermidis transmission chains in the NICU will require a deep genomic analysis, combining bacterial genetic background and accessory genome. This study highlighted the need for the integration of whole genome sequencing as a key surveillance tool for infection control in NICUs.",

Identifying and managing vascular disease in patients with multifocal arterial disease is often complex. The CHA2DS2-VASc score encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors and was initially used to assess the risk of thromboembolism, stroke, and death in patients with atrial fibrillation. In recent years, this score has been proposed to predict the prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD) and the correlation between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and CAD in patients who were scheduled for carotid stenting due to carotid artery stenosis (CAS) but had no history of CAD.

A DKD model was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats using a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). High glucose (HG)-stimulated HK-2 cells served as an in vitro model. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in kidney tissues were measured using dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. ELISA was performed to measure MDA, SOD, and GSH in both rat tissues and HK-2 cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses evaluated renal fibrosis, the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, LC3I/II, P62). Hirsutine treatment significantly improved metabolic and renal parameters in rats, enhancing renal function and reducing fibrosis, as shown by lower levels of Vimentin, Collagen-IV, and α-SMA. It alleviated oxidative stress, indicated by reduced ROS and MDA levels and increased SOD and GSH activity. Additionally, hirsutine enhanced autophagy, reflected by higher Beclin 1 and LC3I/II levels and decreased P62 expression. By disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction, hirsutine increased Nrf2 levels and upregulated antioxidative enzymes like NQO1, SOD-2, and HO-1. Hirsutine exhibited renoprotective effects in DKD by modulating the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, mitigating oxidative stress and promoting autophagy, making it a promising candidate for treatment.",

In this study, we tested the combined effects of an AMP, TP4-3, and meropenem on Acinetobacter baumannii, which is responsible for many severe infections and is associated with high rates of overall mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to develop an effective combination therapy for microbial infections. TP4-3 and meropenem were found to act synergistically toward Acinetobacter baumannii and exhibit an activity profile better than those of the individual compounds. TP4-3 is an antimicrobial peptide with proven activity, low toxicity and extended stability. This AMP was combined with meropenem and tested for efficacy against A. baumannii using a panel of in vitro and in vivo tests. The combination of TP4-3 and meropenem exhibited robust activity against Acinetobacter baumannii pathogens. In particular, the combined treatment demonstrated significant antibiofilm properties and a lower degree of induced resistance than meropenem alone. Additionally, the combination showed an excellent activity profile in in vivo studies. Thus, the combination of TP4-3 and meropenem appears to be an effective strategy to mitigate the detrimental consequences of infections caused by this clinically relevant pathogen. Since the combination of TP4-3 and meropenem displayed better activity than the individual compounds, this strategy of combining AMPs with clinical antibiotics may be suitable for development of clinical treatments targeting various microbial infections.",

  "abstract": "Nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is transported by organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a representative adverse event associated with gemcitabine plus nab-PTX (GnP) in patients with pancreatic cancer. Gadoxetic acid is also transported by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. We aimed to assess whether the enhancement effect of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging could predict the development of CIPN for GnP. This study evaluated 27 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging prior to GnP treatment. The contrast enhancement index (CEI), a measure of liver enhancement on hepato-biliary images, was measured. Plasma concentrations of paclitaxel at 0.5, 6, and 24 h after first administration were also determined in 13 patients. Sixteen of the twenty-seven patients (59.3 %) developed ≥ grade 1 CIPN during the first 8 weeks. We found a negative relationship between the CEI and area under the plasma concentration curve of PTX (r = -0.729, p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, a CEI <1.84 and concomitant diabetes mellitus were independent predictors of CIPN development (hazard ratio, 5.37, p = 0.027; hazard ratio, 3.68, p = 0.012, respectively). Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging could be useful in predicting the development of CIPN during GnP therapy.",

This study examined the lung microbiome in two countries with differing antibiotic practices and its relationship to lung function in young children with CF. A binational, longitudinal, observational study was performed to define the lower airway microbiome in infants with CF. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed using lavage fluid to characterize the lung microbiota in 45 infants with and without prophylactic antibiotic therapy at an average age of approximately 3 months and 14 months. The association between pulmonary function, bacterial community diversities, and taxa was assessed. Expected CF bacterial genera and non-traditional bacteria, such as Streptococcus, were identified as core taxa. Microbial community shifts were observed in infants who received antibiotic prophylaxis, with lower alpha diversity (ANOVA, P<0.05) and a higher proportion of Streptococcus at the first visit. Beta diversity (FEV z; MiRKAT, P<0.05) and Streptococcus were associated with FEV z (LASSO and linear regression, β<0). Functional annotation suggested that alteration of lung microbiota may be linked to antimicrobial resistance. Lung microbial diversity in infants with CF varied between the two countries, particularly during early infancy. A shift in the lung microbiome toward a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus was associated with reduced pulmonary function.",

  "abstract": "Cancer-treatment induced cardiovascular diseases are a concern in early breast cancer, especially when radiation is involved and systemic treatments may contribute. Our primary objective was to estimate the frequency of cardiac adverse events after early breast cancer treatment. We performed a systematic review on cardiac events after early breast cancer treatment, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, by searching PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science and cross-checking references from international guidelines on breast cancer treatment and cardio-oncology. Eighty-one studies were selected. Reporting of cardiac events and dose parameters was heterogeneous among studies due to the variability of the events being considered, follow-up duration and patient's age (most reported less than 5% with some as high as 34% at a maximum follow-up of 28 years). The most frequent are ischemic and valvular heart disease. Radiation modalities (hypofractionation, boost, partial or nodal irradiation) do not seem to change the risk of cardiac events. Anthracycline and aromatase inhibitors increase long-term cardiac risk, whereas anti-HER2-related effects are mostly transient. Myocardites with immunotherapy are rare (<1%) but follow-up is short. Other chemotherapy agents and poly(adenosine-diphosphate-ribose)-polymerase inhibitors have not been shown to increase cardiac risks which is reduced with more recent treatments, and increased by young age at diagnosis and previous cardiac risk factors. Advances in treatment seem to lower cardiac events. Prospective studies with exhaustive reporting of toxicity and radiotherapy features are warranted as well as the help of a cardio-oncologist to manage risk factors.",

This study aimed to develop a nanoformulation (Mal-AuNP-Gel) by synthesizing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with maltol (Mal), and coating them with fish gelatin (Gel) to reduce biofilm formation and virulence characteristics of microbial pathogens. Mal-AuNP-Gel showed increased antibacterial activity against all pathogens studied, including bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) and fungal pathogens (e.g., Candida albicans), with MICs up to 2-fold lower than those of Mal-AuNPs. At the sub-MIC level, Mal-AuNPs-Gel, compared to Mal-AuNPs, improved the inhibition of initial-stage biofilm development by a single species of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and C. albicans as well as the mixed-species biofilm of S. aureus and C. albicans. Additionally, these nanoparticles significantly inhibited several virulence characteristics such as hemolysis, pyoverdine and pyocyanin production, protease activity, and motility of P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, the expression of genes associated with biofilm formation, quorum sensing, motility, and virulence factors in P. aeruginosa was found to be suppressed by Mal-AuNPs-Gel at a higher level than that of Mal-AuNPs, corroborating the phenotypic effects. The non-cytotoxic effects of Mal-AuNPs and Mal-AuNPs-Gel at sub-MIC levels, as evidenced by results of in vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo phytotoxicity tests, further indicated biocompatibility of the synthesized nanoparticles.",

Information on the commuting distance using public transportation, grouped into none, short (<11.3 km; median), and long (≥11.3 km); demographics; and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure were cross-sectionally collected from 956 employees in June 2022. SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity was defined based on serological tests for the nucleocapsid protein antigen. Among all participants (mean age 36 years; 68.6% female), 118 (12.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity. Participants with long commuting distances were more likely to have ≥3 household members. Compared with non-use of public transportation, neither short nor long commuting distances by public transportation were associated with antibody-positivity (adjusted odds ratio 1.18 [95% confidence interval 0.70-1.98] and 1.62 [0.97-2.71], respectively). In participants with ≤2 household members (n = 706 [73.8%]; mean age 37 years; 72.4% female), a long commuting distance was associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity compared with non-use of public transportation (1.98 [1.02-3.84]). In conclusion, commuting distance using public transportation was not associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positivity in general; however, it may be relevant among healthcare workers with fewer household members.",

  "abstract": "Benign adrenocortical tumours are the most common adrenal neoplasms. Evidence over the past few decades has highlighted sex differences in their prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Cortisol-producing adenomas causing either Cushing's syndrome, particularly those with PRKACA or GNAS somatic mutations associated with a more severe phenotype, or mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) are more commonly observed in women. The mechanisms underpinning this sexual dimorphism remain to be fully elucidated. Studies in mice have revealed a protective role of androgens in males, leading to a decelerated growth rate of adrenocortical cells. Furthermore, evidence from human adrenal tumour tissue suggests that oestrogen, progesterone, and luteinising hormone/choriogonadotropin signalling in the adrenal cortex may play a role in adrenal tumourigenesis and steroid production. Clinically, this is supported by the increased incidence of cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas or nodular hyperplasia during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Notably, women with MACS seem to be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of cortisol excess and carry a higher mortality risk than men. Women with aldosterone-producing adenomas have a higher prevalence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations than men, and patients harbouring these mutations are likely to have more favourable clinical outcomes after adrenalectomy. In this review, we summarise the possible mechanisms behind the sexual dimorphism of benign adrenocortical tumours and provide an up-to-date overview of the sex-specific differences in their prevalence, clinical presentation, and outcomes, focusing on cortisol and aldosterone excess. Considering sexual dimorphism is crucial to guide diagnosis and management, and to counsel these patients for optimised care.",

The hospital records of all premature infants referred to a tertiary center between 2020 and 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Infants born to mothers with GDM, HDP, or both were selected for analysis. Demographic variables, perinatal risk factors, as well as clinical and treatment characteristics of the infants were collected and analyzed. A total of 1161 infants and 2322 eyes, including HDP group (1110 eyes from 555 infants), GDM group (944 eyes from 472 infants), and GDM-HDP group (268 eyes from 134 infants), were enrolled. The mean gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) for all infants were 31.6 ± 2.5 weeks and 1572 ± 427 g, respectively. A higher percentage of eyes (76.5%) in the GDM group were classified as ROP or incomplete vascularization compared to the HDP group (71.6%), with the prevalence of severe ROP also higher in the GDM group (13.5%) than in the HDP group (9.9%; P < 0.05 for both comparisons). The rates of ROP and severe ROP were similar between the GDM and GDM-HDP groups. When considering only infants with BW < 1500, the GDM group still exhibited a higher rate of ROP and severe ROP compared to the HDP group. Treatment was required in 17.5% of eyes in the GDM group, 16.8% in the GDM-HDP group, and 13.9% in the HDP group (P = 0.071). GDM is a higher risk factor for ROP and developing severe ROP than HDP. However, the data indicate that careful monitoring and management of both GDM and HDP during pregnancy may be crucial in mitigating the risk of severe ROP.",

  "abstract": "Insulin secretion and resistance are key pathophysiological factors in type 2 diabetes. However, only 55% of patients achieve long-term blood glucose treatment goals, highlighting the need to clarify the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. While cortisol and aldosterone levels have been linked to insulin secretion and resistance in participants without type 2 diabetes, their role in patients with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships among insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and cortisol or aldosterone levels in patients with untreated type 2 diabetes. We retrospectively reviewed 121 patients with untreated type 2 diabetes mellitus. We analyzed the relationships between various clinical parameters, including adrenal hormones, and insulin secretion (homeostatic model assessment [HOMA2-%B]) or insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR). Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify parameters associated with HOMA2-%B or HOMA2-IR. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient revealed that body weight (BW); body mass index (BMI); estimated glomerular filtration rate; and serum creatinine, uric acid, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), sodium, potassium, chloride, fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum C-peptide, and cortisol levels were significantly correlated with HOMA2-%B. Similarly, BW, BMI, aspartate transaminase levels, alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, triglyceride levels, HDL-C levels, FBG levels, serum C-peptide levels, renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) were significantly correlated with HOMA2-IR. Multiple regression analysis revealed BMI, HbA1c levels, and cortisol levels as predictors of HOMA2-%B, whereas ALT levels and the PAC were predictors of HOMA2-IR. Serum cortisol levels are associated with insulin secretion, and the PAC is associated with insulin resistance in patients with untreated type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest that aldosterone blockade may represent a potential therapeutic approach for reducing insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to identify the risk factors for the progression from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) to spinal tuberculosis (STB), which is crucial for early disease intervention, optimizing treatment strategies, and improving patient prognosis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 326 patients diagnosed with PTB between January 2017 and October 2024. Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic data were collected, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) score, diabetes, per capita income, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and a history of recurrent PTB. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors for the progression to STB, and interaction effect analysis and risk stratification based on the NRS-2002 score were conducted to assess its predictive value. Univariate logistic regression revealed that the NRS-2002 score (OR = 2.762, p < 0.001), recurrent PTB (OR = 15.370, p < 0.001), and living in relative poverty (OR = 10.000, p = 0.002) were significant risk factors for the progression from PTB to STB. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that the NRS-2002 score (OR = 11.22, p < 0.001), recurrent PTB (OR = 5.08, p < 0.001), and living in relative poverty (OR = 2.58, p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased likelihood of STB progression. Stratified analysis revealed a clear dose-response relationship between higher NRS-2002 scores and the risk of progression to STB, with those having scores ≥ 6 exhibiting the highest odds (OR = 91.59, p < 0.001). This study highlights critical risk factors for the progression from PTB to STB, particularly the NRS-2002 score, recurrent PTB, and socioeconomic status (living in relative poverty). The NRS-2002 score was identified as the most significant predictor, demonstrating a strong dose-response relationship with disease progression. Clinically, early identification of patients with elevated NRS-2002 scores, alongside timely nutritional interventions and efforts to alleviate poverty, can significantly reduce the risk of STB development. These findings can inform clinical decision-making, enhance early intervention strategies, and guide public health policies aimed at preventing STB, particularly in high-risk populations.",

References of the included studies were reviewed, and citation tracking was used. Eligible studies were English or Chinese peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving patients with type 2 diabetes, with PCC applied in the trial group and routine care in the control group, focusing on self-management outcomes. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data, resolving disagreements through a third reviewer. The Cochrane risk assessment tool was used to assess study quality, with Review Manager 5.3 software used to analyse data using mean difference (MD) and 95%CI via a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested, and sensitivity analysis and funnel plots were also used. A total of 18 RCTs were included, including 6 Chinese and 12 English studies, with 1,893 patients with type 2 diabetes followed up in this study. Following intervention for at least 6 months, compared with routine treatment, PCC reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) (MD = - 1.27, 95%CI: [- 2.19, - 0.74], I  = 34%, fixed-effect model) and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG) (MD = - 0.76, 95%CI: [- 1.23,-0.28], I  = 81%, random-effects model), but there was no improvement in body mass index (BMI) (MD = - 0.59, 95%CI: [- 1.31, - 0.13], I  = 0%, fixed-effect model) or foot care (MD = - 1.51, 95%CI: [- 2.17, - 5.19], I  = 94%, random-effects model).

The increasing antimicrobial resistance among K. pneumoniae strains poses a critical challenge to effective treatment. This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of initial antimicrobial therapy, determine the 30-day all-cause mortality rate, and identify predictors of mortality among patients infected with K. pneumoniae in Lebanese hospitals. A multicenter retrospective observational study was conducted across three university hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon. The study included hospitalized adult patients with confirmed K. pneumoniae infections. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were used to analyze time-to-mortality. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of mortality. Of 2,655 cases screened, 410 patients were enrolled, and 395 cases were included in the final analysis of the 30-day mortality after excluding those lost to follow-up. Nearly one-third of the isolates (36.8%) were extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing, while 6.8% were carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP). The most commonly prescribed empirical antibiotics were meropenem (31.7%), amikacin (28.5%), and ceftriaxone (22.2%). Around one-third of the patients (32.9%) received inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy. The 30-day mortality rate was 14.4%. Main predictors significantly associated with mortality in patients with K. pneumoniae infection were solid cancer (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.82, P < 0.01), coronary artery disease (AOR = 4.81, P = 0.01), age ≥ 65 years (AOR = 4.22, P = 0.02), type II diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.96, P = 0.01), receiving inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy (AOR = 2.96, P = 0.02), infection with CRKP isolates (AOR = 2.53, P = 0.03), and having a higher Charlson comorbidity index (AOR = 1.61, P = 0.001). The study highlights the critical need for effective antimicrobial stewardship and tailored infection control protocols to mitigate the high resistance rates and improve patient outcomes in Lebanon. Emphasis should be placed on enhancing the monitoring of local resistance patterns and using these data to guide the selection of appropriate empirical therapy to reduce mortality associated with K. pneumoniae infections.",

Subsequently, molecular docking, MD simulation, and survival analysis were performed. Experimental validation included CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, apoptosis detection, cell cycle analysis, wound healing assays, Transwell migration assays, Western blotting, and mouse subcutaneous tumor formation experiments to evaluate the effects of quercetin, as an active monomer in Banzhilian, on Gastric cancer cells (HGC-27-HG cells) under high-glucose conditions. In this study, quercetin was identified as the key active component, with AKT1, TP53, JUN, MYC, and CCND1 recognized as the target genes, and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway as the primary regulatory pathway. The results of the study indicate that the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of HGC-27-HG cells are significantly higher than those of HGC-27 cells. However, quercetin inhibited the growth of HGC-27-HG cells, promoted apoptosis, induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and reduced the cells' migration and invasion abilities. Furthermore, it downregulated the expression of target genes and their phosphorylation levels. The experimental findings confirmed that quercetin, as an active monomer in Banzhilian, suppresses the proliferation of HGC-27-HG cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/MYC pathway, promoting apoptosis, blocking cell cycle progression, and inhibiting cell migration and invasion.",

  "abstract": "Coronary artery disease remains a leading cause of morbidity, requiring complex revascularization strategies, especially in patients with heavily calcified lesions. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a common treatment, but it carries risks such as coronary artery perforation and the rare Kokeshi phenomenon during rotational atherectomy (RA). This study aims to emphasize the challenges faced in treating heavily calcified coronary lesions, specifically focusing on the rare Kokeshi phenomenon and coronary artery perforation during RA. We report the case of a man in his 70s with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed the culprit lesion to be a heavily calcified right coronary artery disease. After an initial unsuccessful PCI attempt due to a balloon uncrossable lesion in the right coronary artery, the patient underwent a complex RA-PCI. The procedure was complicated by the Kokeshi phenomenon, where the rota-burr became stuck in the calcified lesion, and coronary artery perforation occurred. Through innovative management, including the use of covered stents, both complications were successfully resolved, and the patient was discharged in stable condition. This case highlights the challenges and potential complications in treating heavily calcified coronary lesions with RA-PCI. Successful management requires prompt identification and innovative solutions to mitigate risks and improve outcomes. The patient's condition was stabilized, and the procedure was successful, with full resolution of complications and normalization of cardiac function postprocedure.",

  "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of invasive and non-invasive diseases, particularly in children and immunocompromised individuals, with an annual mortality of approximately 800,000 children worldwide. The rise of antibiotic-resistant strains complicates treatment, especially with increasing resistance to penicillin, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. The study on the resistance of newly developed antimicrobial agents against S. pneumoniae was rarely reported. Furthermore, understanding the relationship between serotypes, resistance mechanisms, and virulence in S. pneumoniae is essential for disease management and vaccine development. A total of 208 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected across nine hospitals in seven Chinese cities/provinces from January 2023 to June 2024. Molecular characteristics were analyzed using whole-genome sequencing to identify serotypes, sequence types, virulence genes, and potential resistance mechanisms. Antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) was performed against 14 agents, involving new antibiotics (eravacycline, omadacycline, nemonoxacin, and contezolid). Serotypes 19 F (24.6%) and 23 F (11.1%) predominated, with vaccine coverage rates of PCV13 at 66.8%. High resistance rates in S. pneumoniae were observed for erythromycin (208/208, 100%), clindamycin (197/208, 94.7%), and tetracycline (192/208, 92.3%). 13.5% (28/208) and 2.9% (6/208) strains were intermediate and resistant to penicillin, respectively. The new antibiotics showed low resistance, namely, 1.9% (4/208), 0.5% (1/208), 1.9% (4/208), and 7.2% (15/208) resistant to eravacycline, omadacycline, contezolid, and nemonoxacin, respectively. Resistance mechanisms included mutations in 23S rRNA for oxazolidinones, tet genes for tetracyclines, and gyrA/parC for fluoroquinolones. S. pneumoniae in China exhibits high genetic diversity and significant antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for continuous surveillance and updated vaccines. New antibiotics remain effective against multidrug-resistant strains, offering potential treatment options in clinical settings.",

Here, we identify and characterize a molecule, NM102, that displays antimicrobial activity exclusively in the context of infection. NM102 inhibits the activity of the non-essential Mutation Frequency Decline (Mfd) protein by competing with ATP binding to its active site. Inhibition of Mfd by NM102 sensitizes pathogenic bacteria to the host immune response and blocks infections caused by the clinically-relevant bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, without inducing host toxicity. Finally, NM102 inhibits the mutation and evolvability function of Mfd, thus reducing the bacterial capacity to develop antimicrobial resistance. These data provide a potential roadmap for the development of drugs to combat antimicrobial resistance.",

  "abstract": "Clinical mastitis (CM) remains a critical challenge in dairy production, exacerbated by the global rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which threatens herd health and productivity. This study pioneers a dual genomic-computational strategy to develop bacteriocin-based therapeutics-a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics-by targeting conserved virulence mechanisms in CM-causing pathogens. We aimed to (i) identify essential core proteins in CM-causing pathogens of dairy cows using the genomic approach; and (ii) assess the efficacy of bacteriocin peptides (BPs) as novel therapeutic agents targeting the selected core proteins for sustainable management of mastitis. Through pan-genomic analysis of 16 clinically relevant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. warneri, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. putida, and P. asiatica, we identified 65 evolutionarily conserved core proteins. Prioritization based on essentiality, virulence, and resistance potential revealed Rho (transcription termination factor) and HupB (nucleoid-associated protein) as high-value therapeutic targets due to their critical roles in bacterial survival and pathogenicity. A computational screen of 70 BPs identified 14 candidates with high binding affinity for both Rho and HupB proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that BP8, a novel dual-action bacteriocin, competitively inhibits Rho-mediated transcription termination and disrupts HupB-DNA interactions, effectively crippling bacterial replication and virulence. BP8 exhibited superior structural stability and binding efficacy compared to other candidates, positioning it as a potent broad-spectrum agent against diverse CM pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. Our study underscores the untapped potential of bacteriocins in veterinary medicine, offering a sustainable solution to mitigate antibiotic overuse and resistance. The computational validation of BP8 provides a foundational framework for developing targeted therapies, with implications for reducing dairy industry losses and improving animal welfare. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to translate these insights into practical therapeutics.",

This study aimed to reveal UTI prevalence in Jordan, identify risk practices, assess antibiotic adherence, and evaluate UTI recurrence among pregnant women. A prospective observational cohort study, conducted from January to July 2023, was employed to Urinary tract infections (UTIs) during pregnancy. Participants were recruited during routine visits to Al-Bashir Governmental Hospital and Jamil Al-Totenji Governmental Hospital maternity clinics in Jordan. Binary logistic regression identified UTI predictors among pregnant women. Out of 536 participants, 34.3% of pregnant women were found to have UTIs. Amoxicillin/clavulanate demonstrated the highest level of resistance among the tested antibiotics and 42.4% of the pregnant participants adhered to the prescribed antibiotic regimen. Several factors were identified as contributing to an elevated risk of UTIs, including elevated body mass index (BMI) (P = .011), utilization of dry toilet paper (P = .023), frequent utilization of public restroom facilities (P < .001), delayed urination (P < .001), nonuse of cotton underwear (P = .019), frequent sexual activity (P < .001), lack of postcoital urination (P < .001), and inadequate genital hygiene before (P < .001) and after (P < .001) intercourse (including the husband's). However, the use of wet wipes was the only factor associated with recurrent UTIs (P = .037).

  "abstract": "The accurate automated extraction of brain vessel centerlines from Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) images plays an important role in diagnosing and treating cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke. Despite its significance, this task is complicated by the complex cerebrovascular structure and heterogeneous imaging quality. This study aims to develop and validate a segmentation-assisted framework designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain vessel centerline extraction from CTA images. We streamline the process of lumen segmentation generation without additional annotation effort from physicians, enhancing the effectiveness of centerline extraction. The framework integrates four modules: (1) pre-processing techniques that register CTA images with a CT atlas and divide these images into input patches, (2) lumen segmentation generation from annotated vessel centerlines using graph cuts and robust kernel regression, (3) a dual-branch topology-aware UNet (DTUNet) that optimizes the use of the annotated vessel centerlines and the generated lumen segmentation via a topology-aware loss (TAL) and its dual-branch structure, and (4) post-processing methods that skeletonize and refine the lumen segmentation predicted by the DTUNet. An in-house dataset derived from a subset of the MR CLEAN Registry is used to evaluate the proposed framework. The dataset comprises 10 intracranial CTA images, and 40 cube CTA sub-images with a resolution of   voxels. Via five-fold cross-validation on this dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of average symmetric centerline distance (ASCD) and overlap (OV). Specifically, it achieves an ASCD of 0.84, an   of 0.839, and an   of 0.885 for intracranial CTA images, and obtains an ASCD of 1.26, an   of 0.779, and an   of 0.824 for cube CTA sub-images. Subgroup analyses further suggest that the proposed framework holds promise in clinical applications for stroke diagnosis and treatment. By automating the process of lumen segmentation generation and optimizing the network design of vessel centerline extraction, DTUnet achieves high performance without introducing additional annotation demands. This solution promises to be beneficial in various clinical applications in cerebrovascular disease management.",

  "abstract": "Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication of arthroplasty surgery, mostly caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS). Multidrug resistance is of major concern in this setting: i) it can negatively impact outcome, restricting the use of the most effective antimicrobials; ii) it may influence the choice of surgical strategies; and iii) it restrains the therapeutic options to newly labelled antimicrobials with limited experience in PJI. To provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical impact of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-positive PJI and on current and innovative therapeutic strategies. The review is based on PubMed searches for relevant topics, including multiresistant staphylococci PJI and the discussed specific therapeutic approaches. Given the very few randomized trials in this setting, discussion is mostly based on observational studies and the experience and opinion of the authors. Methicillin resistance is an important concern in staphylococcal PJI, especially in CNS. However, its impact on outcome is controversial. Conversely, rifampicin and/or fluoroquinolone resistance are associated with worse prognosis, and might be considered when defining difficult-to-treat pathogens in the PJI setting. There is very little experience with recently developed anti-Gram-positive antimicrobial in PJI, but evaluations of their antibiofilm activities are promising, and some of them might represent significant advances regarding antimicrobial tolerance (such as tedizolid) or PK profiles (such as dalbavancin) during long-term treatment required for PJI. Evaluation of innovative strategies in this setting is crucial, including repositioning of current surgical options using local antimicrobial delivery, PK monitoring and modelling to optimize antimicrobial therapy, suppressive antimicrobial treatment and/or phage-based approaches. Prosthetic joint infections caused by resistant Gram-positive bacteria - including rifampicin- and/or fluoroquinolone-resistant staphylococci - may be associated with a poorer prognosis. It is therefore essential to optimise medical and surgical management, and to find new therapeutic alternatives.",

  "abstract": "Among noncommunicable diseases, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity. In China, diabetes is renowned for its high incidence rate, and the body roundness index (BRI) is an emerging indicator for assessing obesity, particularly abdominal obesity. High BRI may lead to new-onset CVD events. However, the relationships between the BRI and new-onset CVD in individuals with or without diabetes remain unclear. Data for this analysis were extracted from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Our research utilized a cohort that was meticulously assessed over a period from 2011 to 2018, encompassing a comprehensive follow-up of 17,708 participants. Ultimately, this study focused on a subset of 6,737 individuals aged 45 years or older. Methodological approaches include Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS) analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, subgroup analysis, and mediation analysis to explore the relationships of interest. This study included 6,737 participants, all of whom were above the age of 45. Our findings revealed that within this demographic group, 1,481 (22.0%) patients experienced new-onset CVD. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis further revealed that the group characterized by non-diabetes mellitus (Non-DM) had the lowest cumulative incidence of CVD compared with the diabetes mellitus (DM) group. Multivariate Cox regression revealed that in the fully adjusted model (Model 3) (HR = 1.122, 95% CI = 1.080 to 1.167), BRI was associated with the risk of CVD in the Non-DM group during the three-wave follow-up. RCS analysis revealed a positive, linear-like dose‒dependent relationship between BRI and new-onset CVD in Non-DM patients (P = 0.007, P for nonlinearity = 0.938). Smoking could affect the ability of the BRI to predict the incidence rate of CVD in the total population and in the population without diabetes (P interaction = 0.007). Moreover, the mediating effect of the BRI on new-onset CVD among diabetic patients was particularly pronounced in the long term, exceeding 4 years. Our findings demonstrate a significant association between the BRI and CVD risk in non-diabetic individuals, with diabetes influencing the incidence and risk of new-onset CVD in middle-aged and elderly Chinese populations through the BRI playing a mediating role. As an obesity indicator, the BRI provides a valuable tool for early detection and intervention of CVD. Not applicable.",

A retrospective analysis of 111 patients diagnosed with ILD who underwent iBAL for diagnostic purposes between January 2018 and January 2023 was conducted. The identification of PPF was based on the criteria outlined in the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guidelines. Clinical data, pulmonary function tests, radiological imaging, and BAL cellular composition were collected. Groups were compared using the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Linear mixed-effect modelling was used to assess the association between baseline cell composition and longitudinal lung function decline. A total of 33.3% of patients exhibited a PPF phenotype. A significant association between baseline iBAL CD4 + and CD8 + T cell percentages and forced vital capacity (FVC) decline within the first year was observed. Other cell types were not associated with ILD progression within one-year of follow-up. CD4 + and CD8 + T cell percentages significantly correlated with FVC changes in patients with fibrotic ILD. No further associations were found between the baseline iBAL cellular profiles and disease progression. These findings suggest that baseline iBAL cellular profiles may hold some promise in predicting fibrotic ILD disease progression. Further (prospective) studies using larger cohorts may be needed to elucidate the association between the cellular composition of iBAL fluid and pulmonary fibrosis progression.",

  "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii pose a major public health threat. These bacteria often display broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance, rendering them resistant to nearly all classes of antibiotics. Hydrogen sulfide (H S), a compound naturally produced by many bacterial species, has been proposed to exert a protective effect against certain antibiotics. However, A. baumannii does not produced H S. To investigate the effect of exogenous H S on antibiotic resistance, several clinical isolates of carbapenemase-producing A. baumannii were cultured under various conditions, including the presence or absence of H S and/or sub-inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and meropenem. Bacterial growth was assessed at multiple time points to evaluate growth dynamics. Exogenous H S alone had a limited impact on bacterial growth. However, its addition reduced the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of gentamicin and sensitized the bacteria to sub-inhibitory concentrations of this antibiotic. This study highlights the potential of H S as an antibiotic potentiator, suggesting that the use of this combination may be a promising strategy for treating pulmonary infections caused by A. baumannii or for preventing colonization on medical devices such as catheters.",

Annual percentage changes were calculated, and stratified analyses were conducted based on age, region, nation, and socio-demographic index levels to assess the distribution of metabolic disorders in WCBA. Globally, the overall burden of metabolic disorders among WCBA has increased. In 2021, obesity (330.21 [148.37-518.36]) had the highest age-standardized DALYs rate, followed by hypertension (200.75 [154.67-245.47]), type 2 diabetes mellitus (175.11 [134.18-223.42]), hyperlipidemia (139.02 [101.32-173.61]), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (10.1 [7.17-13.92]). The most significant changes of the overall metabolic disorders burden in WCBA were observed in younger age groups. The burden of metabolic disorders was higher in less-developed regions. Given the marked increase in the burden of metabolic disorders among younger WCBA, it is recommended that healthcare management be reinforced for this demographic. Furthermore, based on the varying burdens observed across regions, targeted metabolic interventions for WCBA should be tailored to local conditions.",

  "abstract": "Excessive caloric intake and reduced energy expenditure contribute to obesity and localized fat accumulation, adversely affecting overall health. Despite advancements in obesity treatments, noninvasive approaches for targeted fat reduction remain limited. This study introduces a novel sonosensitizer microparticle, cerium-doped calcium carbonate (CaCO :Ce), and evaluates its potential application in combination with low-intensity ultrasound (LIUS) for noninvasive body sculpting. CaCO :Ce was synthesized via an environmentally friendly method, producing uniform 1.77 μm particles optimized for endocytosis. Energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed successful cerium doping. The particles demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and generated reactive oxygen species under LIUS exposure. Safety was validated through biochemical, hematological, and histological analyses in Sprague-Dawley rats. Animal experiments further revealed that CaCO :Ce combined with ultrasound significantly reduced body weight growth rates, waistline measurements, and subcutaneous fat accumulation. These findings suggest that CaCO :Ce, coupled with LIUS, offers a promising, noninvasive, and low-risk strategy for body sculpting, addressing limitations of current methodologies.",

  "abstract": "Resistant starch (RS) is recognized as a nutritional strategy that supports gut and overall host health by modulating gut microbiota. To directly assess the effects of RS on gut microbiota and its role in improving intestinal barrier function in meat ducks, this study first established an antibiotic-induced microbial dysbiosis model, which was characterized by reduced gut microbial diversity, intestinal dysfunction, and an inflammatory outburst following antibiotic exposure. Whereafter, in addition to the control group, ducks treated with antibiotics for 7 consecutive days were further allocated to two groups and fed the basal diet and RS diet that derived from 12 % raw potato starch until 21 d. The results demonstrated that dietary RS supplementation reversed the antibiotic-induced reduction in microbial diversity and restored the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio. Additionally, RS inclusion enriched beneficial bacterial genera, including Coprobacter, Odoribacter, and Faecalibacterium (LDA score > 3). Post-antibiotic intervention led to a reduction in villus density and muscular thickness, accompanied by a significant downregulation (P < 0.05) of zonula occludens-1 and mucin-2 expression, along with increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (P < 0.05). Notably, dietary RS supplementation significantly enhanced (P < 0.05) the expression of glucagon-like peptide receptor and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2, while suppressing caspase transcription. This resulted in increased villus height and muscular thickness in the ileum (P < 0.05). Furthermore, RS intervention remarkably reduced (P < 0.05) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, particularly interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, in both the ileum and serum. These effects were likely linked to alterations in cecal microbiota, including increased abundances of Barnesiella, Ruminiclostridium 9, Megamonas, Faecalitalea, Adlercreutzia, Coprobacter and Collinsella. In conclusion, dietary RS supplementation mitigated antibiotic-induced cecal microbial dysbiosis and restored intestinal structure by promoting enterocyte proliferation and reducing apoptosis. Consequently, RS supplementation helped alleviate systemic inflammation in meat ducks following antibiotic treatment.",

  "abstract": "As a heterogeneous syndrome, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has become the leading form of heart failure worldwide. Increasing evidence has identified that diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of HFpEF. Worse still, the coexistence of both diseases poses a great threat to human health by further worsening the cardiovascular system and accelerating the progression of diabetes. Although several studies have indicated that the novel antidiabetic drugs, including sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) provide the cardiovascular benefits in T2DM patients with HFpEF, the elaborated roles and mechanisms are not fully understood. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art evidence regarding the epidemiology and pathophysiology of diabetic HFpEF, and the landscape of the novel antidiabetic drugs in the treatment of diabetic HFpEF, as well as discuss the relevant mechanisms, aiming to broaden the understanding of diabetic HFpEF and gain new insight into the treatment of this disease.",

  "abstract": "The duck gut microbiota is essential for host health and is considered a potential reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). However, research on ARGs in the duck gut microbiota is limited. This study collected 120 intestinal content samples from five segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colorectum) of ducks raised under two rearing conditions (with or without an open-air swimming pool). We compiled a comprehensive inventory of microbial genes in the duck gut and conducted an analysis of microbial composition and function across all intestinal segments using 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with metagenomics. The findings revealed that Firmicutes were the most prevalent microbes in all intestinal segments. In the foregut (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), microbial functions were mainly related to genetic information processing such as transcription, translation, replication, and glycosynthesis/gluconeogenesis. Conversely, in the hindgut (cecum and colorectum), microbial functions were primarily associated with the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and various metabolic pathways. The analysis of ARGs indicated a higher relative abundance of ARGs in the cecum and colorectum (P < 0.05) of ducks in the presence of an open-air swimming pool compared to the absence of one. Furthermore, through co-occurrence network analysis, we identified Bacteroides, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Blautia as potential hosts of ARGs such as tetQ, tet32, tet37, vanR, vanG, and acrB in the hindgut. This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between ARGs and the microbial community in duck intestines, laying a theoretical groundwork for understanding the transmission dynamics of ARGs in these ecosystems.",

  "abstract": "A mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 invaded the human nervous system. This was confirmed by an increase in biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of COVID-19 patients. To confirm the neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV-2, a series of analyses were conducted utilizing accessible datasets by MR. In addition, external validation was conducted by testing specific proteins in a retrospective cohort study, which included 40 COVID-19 patients with neurological complications and 15 disease controls (DC). Our investigation revealed the hospitalization, severity of COVID-19 increased the area and volume of certain brain regions, but no other significant causal effects were found of brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) on COVID-19. Notably, the COVID-19 hospitalization significantly increased the area and volume of the left caudal middle frontal gyrus (p_fdr = 0.012; p_fdr = 0.012, respectively). Additionally, COVID-19 severity was linked to the area, volume of the right caudal anterior-cingulate cortex and the volume of the right cuneus cortex (p_fdr = 0.023; p_fdr = 0.025; p_fdr = 0.026, respectively). In the CSF of COVID-19 patients, the median level of CHI3L1 was significantly higher (13677 pg/mL) compared to the DC group (8421 pg/mL, p < 1.00E-04). Similar trends were also found in CSF KLK6 and NGF-β. Additionally, the median NRGN level in plasma was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (1013.00 pg/mL) compared to the control group (360.00 pg/mL, p = 6.50E-03). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients experiencing moderate to critical symptoms exhibited higher levels of GFAP in their CSF compared to those without. Elevated CSF levels of GFAP and S100B were also found in COVID-19 patients with decreased consciousness and comorbidities. This MR analysis provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may invade the human nervous system, as indicated by the increased levels of CSF biomarkers CHI3L1, NGF-β, and KLK6 in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggested that neuroinflammation could be a potential mechanism underlying the neurological complications seen in COVID-19 patients.",

  "abstract": "Maintenance hemodialysis patients experience high morbidity and mortality, primarily from cardiovascular and infectious diseases. It was discovered recently that low arterial oxygen saturation (SaO ) is associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype and poor patient outcomes. Sleep apnea is highly prevalent in maintenance hemodialysis patients and may contribute to intradialytic hypoxemia. In sleep apnea, normal respiration patterns are disrupted by episodes of apnea because of either disturbed respiratory control (i.e., central sleep apnea) or upper airway obstruction (i.e., obstructive sleep apnea). Intermittent SaO  saw-tooth patterns are a hallmark of sleep apnea. Continuous intradialytic measurements of SaO  provide an opportunity to follow the temporal evolution of SaO  during hemodialysis. Using artificial intelligence, we aimed to automatically identify patients with repetitive episodes of intermittent SaO  saw-tooth patterns. The analysis utilized intradialytic SaO  measurements by the Crit-Line device (Fresenius Medical Care, Waltham, MA). In patients with an arterio-venous fistula as vascular access, this FDA approved device records 150 SaO  measurements per second in the extracorporeal blood circuit of the hemodialysis system. The average SaO  of a 10-second segment is computed and streamed to the cloud. Periods comprising thirty 10-second segments (i.e., 300 s or five minutes) were independently adjudicated by two researchers for the presence or absence of SaO  saw-tooth pattern. We built one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN), a state-of-the-art deep learning method, for SaO  pattern classification and randomly assigned SaO  time series segments to either a training (80%) or a test (20%) set. We analyzed 4,075 consecutive 5-minute segments from 89 hemodialysis treatments in 22 hemodialysis patients. While 891 (21.9%) segments showed saw-tooth pattern, 3,184 (78.1%) did not. In the test data set, the rate of correct SaO  pattern classification was 96% with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.995 (95% CI: 0.993 to 0.998). Our 1D-CNN algorithm accurately classifies SaO  saw-tooth pattern. The SaO  pattern classification can be performed in real time during an ongoing hemodialysis treatment, provide timely alert in the event of respiratory instability or sleep apnea, and trigger further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",

  "abstract": "Deciphering the functionality and dynamics of brain networks across different regions and age groups in non-human primates (NHPs) is crucial for understanding the evolution of human cognition as well as the processes underlying brain pathogenesis. However, systemic delineation of the cellular composition and molecular connections among multiple brain regions and their alterations induced by aging in NHPs remain largely unresolved. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on 39 samples collected from 10 brain regions of two young and two aged rhesus macaques using the DNBelab C4 system. Validation of protein expression of signatures specific to particular cell types, brain regions, and aging was conducted through a series of immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining experiments. Loss-of-function experiments mediated by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting two age-related genes (i.e., VSNL1 and HPCAL4) were performed in U251 glioma cells to verify their aging effects. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of senescence marker genes were employed to assess cellular senescence in U251 cells. We have established a large-scale cell atlas encompassing over 330,000 cells for the rhesus macaque brain. Our analysis identified numerous gene expression signatures that were specific to particular cell types, subtypes, brain regions, and aging. These datasets greatly expand our knowledge of primate brain organization and highlight the potential involvement of specific molecular and cellular components in both the regionalization and functional integrity of the brain. Our analysis also disclosed extensive transcriptional alterations and cell-cell connections across brain regions in the aging macaques. Finally, by examining the heritability enrichment of human complex traits and diseases, we determined that neurological traits were significantly enriched in neuronal cells and multiple regions with aging-relevant gene expression signatures, while immune-related traits exhibited pronounced enrichment in microglia. Taken together, our study presents a valuable resource for investigating the cellular and molecular architecture of the primate nervous system, thereby expanding our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain function, aging, and disease.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of CYP2C19 variants in Syrian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and evaluate the impact of these variants on the clinical efficacy of a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study included 50 Syrian CAD patients on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel. CYP2C19 genotypes were determined by PCR, followed by Sanger sequencing. Clinical outcomes, including major acute cardiovascular events (MACE) and bleeding events, were monitored over 18-24 months. The allele frequencies were 8% for CYP2C19*2, 0% for CYP2C19*3, and 17% for CYP2C19*17. The distribution of our study population by CYP2C19 genotype-predicted metabolizer phenotypes was 56% for normal metabolizers (NMs), 26% for intermediate metabolizers (IMs), 12% for rapid metabolizers (RMs), and 2% for ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs). No association was found between the CYP2C19*2 allele and recurrent ischemic events or between the CYP2C19*17 allele and bleeding complications in patients treated with a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel. In Syrian patients undergoing PCI, a doubled maintenance dose of clopidogrel (150 mg/day) may help mitigate variability in response due to CYP2C19*2 carrier status, offering potential benefits in optimizing antiplatelet therapy. However, given the study's limited sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and larger studies are needed to confirm this potential benefit.",

  "abstract": "Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic flavivirus with a geographic range that has expanded over recent years. Maintained in a transmission cycle between mosquito vectors and avian reservoirs the virus can cause large seasonal outbreaks in bird populations, but spillover into mammalian hosts has also been reported. While usually mild or asymptomatic in humans, neurological disorders are increasingly observed, which has boosted interest and the need for better understanding of the pathogenesis of various USUV lineages. In this study we inoculated interferon α/β receptor knockout (Ifnar ) mice with decreasing doses of USUV, monitoring symptoms and survival to determine a less lethal dose, and we directly compared isolates from three different viral lineages. We found that a Dutch isolate of USUV Africa-3 lineage is lethal at a dose of 20 pfu per mouse, which is considerably lower than what was anticipated based upon the literature. A Europe-2 strain showed an even higher virulence in this mouse model, compared to strains from Africa-3 and Europe-3 lineages-though this was not reflected in in vitro studies. These results enhance our understanding of the pathogenicity of different USUV strains and provide guidance for the use of low doses for inoculation in an Ifnar  animal model.",

  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, and dyslipidemia, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/ high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. Although extensive research has been conducted in Western populations, the relationship between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and atherosclerosis in the Japanese population remains underexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and atherosclerosis, as measured by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), in a Japanese cohort. This secondary analysis used data from a cross-sectional study involving 912 participants. LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was calculated from fasting blood samples and baPWV was used to assess atherosclerosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and baPWV, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and other potential confounders. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore variations by demographic and clinical factors. The mean age of the study population was 51.1 years, and 64.9% were male. Significant differences were observed across LDL-C/HDL-C ratio tertiles for age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, liver enzymes, lipid profiles and lifestyle factors (p < 0.001 for most). Univariate analyses showed strong associations between atherosclerosis and age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, liver function markers, metabolic factors and lifestyle behaviours (p < 0.001 for most). Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the association between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and baPWV, adjusting for factors such as age, sex, BMI, and other metabolic variables. Subgroup analyses showed significant associations between LDL-C/HDL-C ratio and baPWV in women (p = 0.036), participants aged < 55 years (p = 0.009), and those with BMI < 25 kg/m² (p = 0.044). No significant interactions were observed between subgroups (p for interaction > 0.05). LDL-C/HDL-C ratio is significantly associated with atherosclerosis in the Japanese population, with varying strength in different demographic and clinical subgroups. These findings highlight the importance of LDL-C/HDL-C ratio as a predictor of atherosclerosis and underscore the need for targeted interventions to manage cardiovascular risk in this population.

Disruption of the fractalkine-mediated microglia-neuron communication is associated with divergent outcomes, from damaging to protective, in different neurological conditions (including schizophrenia and epilepsy). In the present work we explore the impact of the absence of the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) after neonatal blockade of NMDA receptors, which induces acute and long-term alterations in behavior, neuronal integrity and excitability. Wild-type (WT) and Cx3cr1  (KO) mice of both sexes randomly received either a low (0.5 mg/kg) or high dose (1 mg/kg) of MK-801 (NMDA receptor antagonist) or saline, for five consecutive days, during early postnatal development. Neuronal apoptosis was assessed at a midpoint of the pharmacological protocol. Survival and growth rates were determined up to adulthood when innate behaviors, unconditioned anxiety, contextual memory and seizure susceptibility were evaluated, as well as hippocampal local field potential and sensory gating. CX3CR1 depletion and neonatal MK-801 treatment had a synergistic acute effect, increasing neuronal apoptosis and overall mortality. Both factors independently induced long-lasting impairments in the wide array of behavioral tasks assessed during adulthood. However, low MK-801 dose treatment greatly augmented the mortality of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in WT mice, an effect prevented by CX3CR1 depletion. MK-801 treatment induced a shift in the power spectrum of the hippocampal local field potential towards higher frequencies that was averted in Cx3cr1  mice by an opposite shift. Our results reveal that CX3CR1 depletion severely increases the vulnerability to neonatal NMDA antagonism with additional complex interactions regarding cognitive and neurophysiological effects, which should be considered in the context of neuron-microglia miscommunication in many neurological disorders including schizophrenia and epilepsy.",

Among the 41 tumor samples, 34 had one pathogenic variant or an allele-loss of   gene and one tumor showed a pathogenic variant in the   gene. Allele frequencies of the total of 46 pathogenic variants varied from 0.05 to 0.82, and none of these variants was found in blood. For 6 tumors, no pathogenic variants were found while 4 of them had allele-loss of the   gene. When the tumors were divided into 3 groups according to the counts of inactivating events (pathogenic variants and allele loss), the clinical parameters including hearing, tumor structure in MRI, tumor growth, tumor size and postoperative facial function did not differ significantly. There was no correlation between phenotype and genetic alterations of the   gene in sporadic schwannomas. Genetic inactivating events are the precondition for the development of vestibular schwannomas but do not influence their growth and other features.",

  "abstract": "Stroke is a cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and disability, causing motor dysfunction and cognitive impairments. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse models of ischemic stroke are used for identifying therapeutic targets. Ischemic insults to the brain alter brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in cortical and hippocampal neurons. In the present study, we investigated BDNF expression in the cortex and hippocampus of mice following MCAO. Monofilament sutures coated with silicone rubber were introduced into the common carotid artery and occluded middle cerebral artery. The filament was withdrawn for reperfusion after 0.5 h. BDNF protein expression was measured using western blot. Immunofluorescence was performed with anti-NeuN and anti-BDNF antibodies. BDNF expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was decreased one and three days after MCAO, compared to the control group (unoperated mice). BDNF was expressed in NeuN-positive neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and motor cortex of the MCAO and control groups. MCAO in mice reduced the expression of BDNF in mature neurons of both the motor cortex and hippocampus at one and three days after surgery.",

We sought to compare long-term sequelae following RSV hospitalisation, contrasted against Omicron COVID-19 and influenza, in children and adults. Retrospective population-based cohort study in Singapore, including all hospitalisations for RSV/influenza from 1  January 2017-3  September 2023, and all COVID-19 hospitalisations following Omicron emergence (1  January 2022-3  September 2023). Risks of new-incident diagnoses/symptoms 31-300 days following a)RSV versus COVID-19 hospitalisation; b)RSV versus influenza hospitalisation, across multiple organ systems, were estimated using Cox regression, adjusted for between-group sociodemographic and clinical differences using overlap weighting. 24,340 paediatric RVI hospitalisations (RSV=8640; influenza=9400; COVID-19=6300) and 82,635 adult RVI hospitalisations (RSV=1553; influenza=10,454; COVID-19=70,628) were included. In children, post-RSV hospitalisation, higher risk and excess-burden (EB) per-1000-individuals of any overall new-incident diagnosis was observed when contrasted against COVID-19/influenza (COVID-19: adjusted-hazards-ratio, aHR=1.63[95%CI=1.24-2.14], EB=9.83[95%CI=5.26-14.41];influenza: aHR=1.76[95%CI=1.37-2.28], EB=10.91[95%CI=6.78-15.04]); risks of respiratory sequelae predominated. In adults, though there was no significant difference in overall risk of post-acute sequelae between RSV and COVID-19/influenza, elevated risk of cardiovascular symptoms (aHR=1.58[95%CI=1.13-2.22]) and other neurological disorders (aHR=1.92[95%CI=1.31-2.80]) was observed in RSV hospitalisations versus COVID-19. While risks of predominantly respiratory sequelae were elevated post-RSV hospitalisation in children versus COVID-19 or influenza, higher risk of extra-pulmonary sequelae (cardiovascular/neurological complications) was observed post-RSV hospitalisation versus COVID-19 in adults. Elevated risks at extremes of age highlight importance of RSV vaccination in these vulnerable groups.",

  "abstract": "The human microbiome has always been an important determinant of health and recently, its role has also been described in cancer. The altered microbiome could aid cancer progression, modulate chemoresistance and significantly alter drug efficacy. The broad implications of microbes in cancer have prompted researchers to investigate the microbe-cancer axis and identify whether modifying the microbiome could sensitize cancer cells for therapy and improve the survival outcome of cancer patients. The preclinical data has shown that enhancing the number of specific microbial species could restore the patients' response to cancer drugs and the microbial biomarkers may play a vital role in cancer diagnostics. The elucidation of detailed interactions of the human microbiota with cancer would not only help identify the novel drug targets but would also enhance the efficacy of existing drugs. The field exploring the emerging roles of microbiome in cancer is at a nascent stage and an in-depth scientific perspective on this topic would make it more accessible to a wider audience. In this review, we discuss the scientific evidence connecting the human microbiome to the origin and progression of cancer. We also discuss the potential mechanisms by which microbiota affects initiation of cancer, metastasis and chemoresistance. We highlight the significance of the microbiome in therapeutic outcome and evaluate the potential of microbe-based cancer therapy.",

  "abstract": "Textbook outcome (TO), a combined quality indicator, encompasses key postoperative indicators such as the absence of complications, R0 resection, and no prolonged length of day. It has been suggested to be of additional value over single outcome parameters in short-term outcomes of surgical treatment. The main objective of this research was to assess the relationship between TO and neoadjuvant therapy (NT), thereby providing insights into NT's role in surgical quality. Patients who underwent minimally invasive rectal surgery were enrolled between January 2019 and June 2024. TO was defined as achieving R0 resection, at least 12 lymph nodes harvested, no adverse outcomes (Clavien-Dindo score ≥ 3, readmission, or mortality within 30 days), and length of stay within the ≤ 75th percentile for the treatment year. The relationship between TO and NT was analyzed using regression analyses. Subgroup analysis and hierarchical regression were conducted to investigate potential influencing factors and interactions. 405 patients were enrolled, with 204 achieving TO. NT was associated with a reduction in TO (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.21 ~ 0.65, p < 0.001), while robotic surgery (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.62 ~ 5.11), total laparoscopic surgery (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.71 ~ 4.56), enhanced recovery after surgery (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.02 ~ 2.59), and stoma (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.18 ~ 2.96) were associated with an increased rate of TO. The impact of NT on TO varied depending on surgery duration; prolonged surgical time exacerbated the negative effect of NT on TO. This observation was consistent with a significant interaction effect. NT is associated with a lower TO rate, especially in patients with prolonged surgical time. Robotic surgery, total laparoscopic surgery, enhanced recovery after surgery, and stoma can improve achieve TO.",

Evaluation of predictive factors of these serious irAEs with a time dependent approach allows better understanding of patients most at risk. To identify different elements of patient data that are significant predictors of early and late-onset or delayed cardio-inflammatory irAEs through various predictive modeling strategies. A cohort of patients receiving ICI therapy from January 1, 2010 to May 1, 2022 was identified from TriNetX meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patient data collected included occurrence of early and later cardio-inflammatory irAEs, patient survival time, patient demographic information, ICI therapies, comorbidities, and medication histories. Predictive and statistical modeling approaches identified unique risk factors for early and later developing cardio-inflammatory irAEs. A cohort of 66,068 patients on ICI therapy were identified in the TriNetX platform; 193 (0.30%) experienced early cardio-inflammatory irAEs and 175 (0.26%) experienced later cardio-inflammatory irAEs. Significant predictors for early irAEs included: anti-PD-1 therapy at index, combination ICI therapy at index, and history of peripheral vascular disease. Significant predictors for later irAEs included: a history of myocarditis and/or pericarditis, cerebrovascular disease, and history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication use. Cardio-inflammatory irAEs can be divided into clinically meaningful categories of early and late based on time since initiation of ICI therapy. Considering distinct risk factors for early-onset and late-onset events may allow for more effective patient monitoring and risk assessment.",

  "abstract": "Despite radical surgery, gastric cancer (GC) survival rates remain low in Western countries. Randomised trials suggest that perioperative chemotherapy downstages disease, improving long-term survival without increasing complications. We compared outcomes for upfront surgery (US) versus surgery combined with perioperative EOX (epirubicin, oxaliplatin, capecitabine) therapy for short- and long-term survival. We analysed 310 patients who underwent curative intent gastrectomy for GC at a single tertiary centre from 2006 to 2017. Patients were assigned to the EOX group (n = 105) or the US group (n = 205). Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilised to balance baseline characteristics, clinical stage, surgery type, and histology. Short-term outcomes included the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) and 30-day mortality, while long-term outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). After PSM, 102 patients remained in each group. The EOX group exhibited significantly lower preoperative haemoglobin levels compared to the US group, but other baseline characteristics were comparable. Tumour-related outcomes favoured the EOX group, with significantly smaller tumours (P < 0.001), fewer metastatic lymph nodes (P = 0.004), and lower tumour stages overall. Splenectomy was more common in the US group (40.2% versus 23.5%, P = 0.011). Postoperative complications were similar between groups, although ICU admissions were more frequent in the EOX group (16.7% versus 6.9%, P = 0.030). Thirty-day mortality rates were low and comparable (1.0% in the EOX group versus 2.0% in the US group, P = 1.000). Long-term outcomes, including overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS), showed no significant differences between the groups. Perioperative EOX therapy is as safe as upfront surgery and significantly reduces metastatic lymph nodes and tumour size, suggesting its role in downstaging the disease. However, despite these promising oncological responses, this benefit does not translate into improved long-term survival.",

  "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and chemotherapy, including antibody-drug conjugates, are widely used for the treatment of patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC). The majority of elderly patients receive concomitant medications to address various comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the impact of concomitant medications on oncological outcomes in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic UC treated with systemic therapy. In August 2024, three datasets were queried for studies evaluating concomitant medications in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic UC. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024547335). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). A fixed- or random-effects model was used for meta-analysis depending on the heterogeneity. We identified 16 eligible studies (3 prospective and 13 retrospective) comprising 4,816 patients. Most reported concomitant medications included proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antibiotics, steroids, and opioids. The use of concomitant PPIs, antibiotics, steroids or opioids during ICI therapy was associated with worsened OS (PPIs: HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.31-1.57, p < 0.001; antibiotics: HR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.04-1.38, p = 0.01; steroids: HR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.25-1.67, p < 0.001; and opioids: HR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.46-2.07, p < 0.001). Concomitant use of antibiotics during chemotherapy did not impact OS (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.67-1.51). When treating advanced unresectable or metastatic UC with ICI therapy, we need to pay attention to concomitant medications, such as PPIs and antibiotics to avoid reducing the efficacy of ICI therapy.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of LVI on long-term postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with CRCLM. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent primary resection for CRCLM at Wuhan Union Hospital from 2013 to 2018. To reduce potential confounders and selection bias, we used propensity score matching (PSM) to compare the clinicopathologic characteristics and long-term prognostic outcomes of patients in the LVI (+) and LVI (-) groups. Cox unifactorial and multifactorial analyses were used to screen relevant factors affecting patient prognosis, and Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to compare differences in patient overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The predictive power of independent factors on patients' long-term prognosis was assessed using receiver operating characteristic ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC). After PSM, 230 patients were enrolled in the study (n = 115 per group). Multifactorial analysis revealed that LVI was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.424; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.004-2.022; P = 0.048 and HR, 1.452; 95% CI, 1.020-2.069; p = 0.039, respectively).

For DFS, the area under the AUROC curve was also better in the LVI (+) subgroup compared with after PSM (AUC at 3 years: 0.825 vs. 0.874; AUC at 5 years: 0.839 vs. 0.863). LVI may significantly impact long-term survival and prognosis in patients with CRCLM undergoing primary resection, potentially serving as an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. Additionally, postoperative chemotherapy appears to significantly improve the long-term prognosis of patients with LVI (+).",

Although natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapy is promising, its efficacy remains limited, necessitating strategies to enhance NK cell cytotoxicity. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition demonstrate potential to enhance NK-mediated killing. However, the combination of HDAC inhibitors and NK cell therapy for DMG remains unexplored. Patient-derived DMG cell lines and orthotopic mouse models were used to evaluate the effects of the class I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 on cytotoxicity. NK cell-mediated lysis was measured using both luciferase and calcein AM-based assays. The downstream signaling pathways affected by MS-275 were investigated via RNA-seq, CUT&Tag assay, RT‒qPCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation with qPCR. Based on bioinformatic analysis, class I HDACs are identified as therapeutic targets in DMG. The corresponding HDAC inhibitor, MS-275 upregulated NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity pathway through GSEA analysis. Pretreating DMG cells with MS-275 elevated NK cell ligand gene expression and enhanced NK cell-induced lysis. In addition to NK-activating ligands, MS-275 elevated the NK-inhibitory ligand HLA-E, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies targeting the NKG2A-HLA-E axis. Mechanistically, MS-275 increased HLA-E expression by promoting STAT3 acetylation at lysine 685. Combining MS-275 with NK cell therapy and blockade of the NKG2A-HLA-E axis extended overall survival in orthotopic mouse models. This study is the first to demonstrate that HDAC inhibition enhances NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in DMG. Combining HDAC inhibition with NK cell therapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating DMG by targeting NKG2A-HLA-E axis.",

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a unique class of single-stranded RNAs featuring covalently closed loop structures that are ubiquitous across species. These molecules perform crucial regulatory functions in the pathogenesis of various diseases through diverse mechanisms, including acting as miRNA sponges, interacting with DNA or proteins, and encoding functional proteins/polypeptides. Recently, numerous circRNAs have been confirmed to have aberrant expression patterns in AML patients. In particular, certain circRNAs are closely associated with specific clinicopathological characteristics and thus have great potential as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in AML. Herein, we systematically summarize the biogenesis, degradation, and functional mechanisms of circRNAs while highlighting their clinical relevance. We also outline a series of online databases and analytical tools available to facilitate circRNA research.

This study systematically evaluated the correlation between PD-L1 expression status and TRAEs in patients with NSCLC. We systematically searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed databases from inception to June 30, 2024, to identify prospective clinical trials examining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors among NSCLC patients that reported treatment-related toxicity data stratified by PD-L1 expression. Twenty-six prospective trials (N = 5,453) were analyzed. At the 1%, 25%, and 50% PD-L1 cutoffs, PD-L1-negative patients presented significantly reduced risks of grade 3-4 TRAEs (OR = 0.37, 0.53, 0.41; 95% CI = 0.18-0.77, 0.31-0.90, 0.19-0.97; P < 0.01, 0.02, 0.04). Similarly, PD-L1-negative patients had significantly reduced risks of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation at the 1% and 25% PD-L1 cutoffs (OR = 0.25, 0.38; 95% CI = 0.08-0.76, 0.16-0.89; P = 0.01, 0.03) but not at the 50% PD-L1 cutoff (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.07-1.12, P = 0.07).

PD-L1 positivity may predict increased risks of grade 3-4 TRAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in NSCLC patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.

  "abstract": "Benign adrenocortical tumours are the most common adrenal neoplasms. Evidence over the past few decades has highlighted sex differences in their prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Cortisol-producing adenomas causing either Cushing's syndrome, particularly those with PRKACA or GNAS somatic mutations associated with a more severe phenotype, or mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) are more commonly observed in women. The mechanisms underpinning this sexual dimorphism remain to be fully elucidated. Studies in mice have revealed a protective role of androgens in males, leading to a decelerated growth rate of adrenocortical cells. Furthermore, evidence from human adrenal tumour tissue suggests that oestrogen, progesterone, and luteinising hormone/choriogonadotropin signalling in the adrenal cortex may play a role in adrenal tumourigenesis and steroid production. Clinically, this is supported by the increased incidence of cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas or nodular hyperplasia during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Notably, women with MACS seem to be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of cortisol excess and carry a higher mortality risk than men. Women with aldosterone-producing adenomas have a higher prevalence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations than men, and patients harbouring these mutations are likely to have more favourable clinical outcomes after adrenalectomy. In this review, we summarise the possible mechanisms behind the sexual dimorphism of benign adrenocortical tumours and provide an up-to-date overview of the sex-specific differences in their prevalence, clinical presentation, and outcomes, focusing on cortisol and aldosterone excess. Considering sexual dimorphism is crucial to guide diagnosis and management, and to counsel these patients for optimised care.",

Here, we explore the utilization of TE-derived enhancers in naïve and expanded pluripotent states by integrative analysis of genome-wide Hi-C-defined enhancer interactions, H3K27ac HiChIP profiling and CRISPR-guided TE proteomics landscape. We find that short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are the more involved TEs in the active chromatin and 3D genome architecture. In particular, mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR), a SINE family member, is highly associated with naïve-specific genomic interactions compared to the expanded state.

This ESRRB and MIR enhancer interaction is crucial for the formation of loops that build a network of enhancers and super-enhancers regulating pluripotency genes. We demonstrate that loss of a ESRRB-bound MIR enhancer impairs self-renewal. We also find that MIR is co-bound by structural protein complex, ESRRB-YY1, in the naïve pluripotent state.

  "abstract": "Benign adrenocortical tumours are the most common adrenal neoplasms. Evidence over the past few decades has highlighted sex differences in their prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes. Cortisol-producing adenomas causing either Cushing's syndrome, particularly those with PRKACA or GNAS somatic mutations associated with a more severe phenotype, or mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) are more commonly observed in women. The mechanisms underpinning this sexual dimorphism remain to be fully elucidated. Studies in mice have revealed a protective role of androgens in males, leading to a decelerated growth rate of adrenocortical cells. Furthermore, evidence from human adrenal tumour tissue suggests that oestrogen, progesterone, and luteinising hormone/choriogonadotropin signalling in the adrenal cortex may play a role in adrenal tumourigenesis and steroid production. Clinically, this is supported by the increased incidence of cortisol-producing adrenocortical adenomas or nodular hyperplasia during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Notably, women with MACS seem to be more vulnerable to the harmful effects of cortisol excess and carry a higher mortality risk than men. Women with aldosterone-producing adenomas have a higher prevalence of somatic KCNJ5 mutations than men, and patients harbouring these mutations are likely to have more favourable clinical outcomes after adrenalectomy. In this review, we summarise the possible mechanisms behind the sexual dimorphism of benign adrenocortical tumours and provide an up-to-date overview of the sex-specific differences in their prevalence, clinical presentation, and outcomes, focusing on cortisol and aldosterone excess. Considering sexual dimorphism is crucial to guide diagnosis and management, and to counsel these patients for optimised care.",
