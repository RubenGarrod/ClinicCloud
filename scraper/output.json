  "abstract": "Autoimmune bullous diseases (AIBDs) are rare, chronic conditions characterized by blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare bleeding disorder in which autoantibodies target coagulation factor VIII, often associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, the simultaneous occurrence of AIBD and AHA is rare, with limited understanding of their combined impacts. We aimed to synthesize the available evidence and provide insights into clinical manifestations, treatment strategies, and survival outcomes of such patients. We searched for relevant literature in four databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus, and combined patient information from our hospital to provide a comprehensive analysis. A total of 80 patients were included. Through log-rank tests, older age (p = 0.03) and bullous pemphigoid (BP) (p = 0.047) were associated with shorter survival time. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model, mortality was only associated with older age (HR: 1.13, p = 0.02). Patients presenting both AIBD and AHA exhibit intricate clinical presentations and are at risk of severe, potentially fatal outcomes. Clinicians should remain vigilant regarding bleeding in AIBD patients, particularly those with BP and those in the geriatric population.",

  "abstract": "Delayed healing of corneal epithelial injury can cause irreversible scarring and severely affect vision. Outstanding progress has been made in recent years regarding corneal epithelial repair. However, studies investigating the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in this process remain limited. The main objective of this study was to explore the role of m6A modification and its regulators in the healing of the corneal epithelium. In this study, we used the C57BL/6 mouse corneal alkali burn model as an in vivo model and human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) as an in vitro subject. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to downregulate the expression of YTHDF2, METTL3, and FTO in HCECs. We evaluated the effects of downregulating m6A modification regulators on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HCECs under basal conditions and following IL-1β stimulation. The results suggest that m6A and its regulators are involved in the healing process of the corneal epithelium. Following corneal alkali burns, m6A levels were elevated, while the expression of METTL3, FTO, and YTHDF2 was reduced. In HCECs stimulated with IL-1β, m6A levels were significantly increased, and the expression of FTO and YTHDF2 was decreased. Silencing METTL3 and YTHDF2 enhanced the proliferation and migration of HCECs by increasing HSP70 expression, thereby facilitating corneal epithelial healing. In contrast, silencing FTO may impede corneal epithelial healing by promoting apoptosis in HCECs and inhibiting their proliferation and migration. This study offers a novel perspective on the treatment of delayed corneal epithelial healing.",
